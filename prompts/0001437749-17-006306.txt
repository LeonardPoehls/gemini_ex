OUR TARGET VERTICAL MARKETS
 
We focus our efforts on delivering mission-critical software solutions to enterprise customers in six core vertical markets within global manufacturing – automotive, life sciences, consumer products, food and beverage, high technology and industrial products. Within these vertical markets we focus on 24 segments where our customers can receive the greatest benefit from our solutions. For each segment we offer solutions designed to overcome the business challenges within that segment, based on our in-depth knowledge of the segment and best practices.
 
Automotive: QAD focuses on the automotive tier supplier segment of companies who must meet critical industry standards such as the Materials Management Operations Guideline/Logistics Evaluation (MMOG/LE) and IATF 16949:2016 (previously ISO/TS 16949). QAD’s automotive-specific processes and built-in industry best practices help automotive tier suppliers reduce costs, mitigate supply chain risk and improve supply chain planning and visibility. Our customer base includes companies serving the global automotive marketplace, especially the tier-1 suppliers in the supply chains of worldwide automotive original equipment manufacturers. We deliver unique capabilities to support the collaboration requirements of the automotive tier suppliers, including the strict quality requirements of Advanced Product Quality Process (“APQP”) and Production Part Approval Process (“PPAP”). Many of our customers use QAD Cloud EDI because it provides a scalable solution which standardizes Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) across their global enterprise. QAD Supplier Portal, which allows for electronic communication with other suppliers, is another product commonly used by our automotive customers. QAD also helps customers manage supply chain risk in accordance with MMOG/LE and the emerging requirements of IATF 16949:2016. QAD solutions are in use at many of the market-leading automotive parts companies throughout the world that manufacture a broad range of components used in interiors, electrical components, safety systems, bodies and drivetrains.

Life Sciences: Life sciences manufacturers are dedicated to innovation, product quality and patient safety; however, the regulatory environment, cost pressures and supply chain complexities are challenges. Emerging markets, quality initiatives, and mergers and acquisitions activity also add to the complexity of life sciences manufacturing and distribution. QAD focuses on the following five segments in the life sciences industry: contract manufacturing and packaging; surgical medical devices; orthopedic medical devices; diagnostic medical devices; and pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies. QAD solutions help global life sciences companies manufacture products in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) and other standards required by regulators around the world. In addition to cGMP, QAD solutions support many business and regulatory processes specific to the life sciences industry, such as automated quality management, supply chain planning and serialization in support of requirements for Unique Device Identification and the Drug Quality and Security Act. Our customers’ products include such items as defibrillators, ventricular assist systems, artificial joints, prescription medications, surgical instruments and packaging for the life sciences industry. QAD’s enterprise applications for life sciences provides our customers with a qualified IT infrastructure as a key building block to help them ensure that they have a solid foundation upon which to base their software validation requirements.
 
Consumer Products: It is vital for consumer products manufacturers to stay ahead of constant changes as product development and replenishment life-cycles can shrink; supply chains may feel the impact of buying pattern shifts; and manufacturers can face tightening margins. In order to gain share and increase profit, consumer products companies must anticipate and meet customer demand while managing their margins and complying with ever-evolving safety and environmental regulations. QAD focuses on the following four segments in the consumer products industry: household and personal packaged products; consumer electronics; assembled and discrete products; and jewelry. The manufacturing process for those items varies and depends on the nature of the item; however, the fulfillment and distribution requirements have significant commonality. Major retailers manage agile supply chains and are typically very demanding of their suppliers, as they strive to service growing demand from consumers for speed of delivery and variety of products. QAD solutions address the complex replenishment requirements of companies supplying the retail supply chain, including promotional pricing, demand planning, quality compliance and product configuration. 
 
Food and Beverage: Food and beverage manufacturing is complex with constant adjustments to product, packaging and pricing, and a lack of uniformity in the supply chain, which challenges food and beverage manufacturers to excel at inventory and supply chain management. At the same time, they must comply with evolving safety and environmental regulations. QAD focuses on the following five segments in the food and beverage industry: shelf stable bottling, canning and packaging; distilleries, wineries and brewing; frozen foods; creameries and fresh foods; and candy and confections. Our solutions support regulatory and quality initiatives, such as the U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act and hazard analysis and critical control point analysis, which address the management of biological, chemical and physical hazards. Our solutions support the product cycle of the food and beverage industry from raw material production, procurement and handling to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product. QAD’s software is standards-focused to help companies ensure food safety and meet the regulatory requirements in the global markets where our customers operate. QAD provides solutions for food and beverage companies that manufacture a broad range of products and manage many of the world’s well-known brands. 
 
High Technology: The success of manufacturers in the high tech industry relies on innovation and the ability to manage change. There is constant pressure on margins, fluidity to global supply chains, challenges with cross border shipments, strains on material availability and imperatives around controlling cost. All of these challenges need to be met while complying with standards and industry regulations. QAD solutions are used by many high-technology companies that manufacture a diverse range of products. QAD focuses on the following three segments in the high technology industry: standalone devices and test equipment; batteries, power supplies and lighting; and cable, wiring and connectors. High-tech companies often face the challenges of very complex product structures with a need for traceability of parts and processes throughout their entire supply chain, as well as tight control of engineering changes. Many high-tech companies providing complex systems also face the challenge of managing installation and support of equipment after sale, in addition to managing field engineering resources. A high-tech manufacturer can use QAD’s solutions to configure product based on customers’ input; manufacture and assemble product according to a customized specification; and schedule, install and support equipment throughout its lifecycle.

Industrial Products: Today’s global customers are demanding more configure-to-order, make-to-order, and assemble-to-order products. The modern, agile industrial manufacturer must be responsive and able to deliver with the highest quality and timeliness. Our customers manufacture products as diverse as machine tools; specialist ceramic materials used in aerospace and defense; and equipment used in the oil and gas industries. Fluctuating demand leads to significant challenges in managing the internal supply chain, coordinating the extended vendor ecosystem, controlling costs, ensuring quality, tracking production, and optimizing inventory levels. Companies in this broad vertical market have requirements to maintain many manufacturing methodologies, often within the same enterprise. QAD focuses on the following six segments in the industrial products industry: flexible packaging; engineered materials; contract manufacturing; standalone equipment; remanufacturing; and roll stock and wire cable. Our solutions support multiple manufacturing methodologies in parallel, including lean manufacturing. The need for traceability of materials from source through to the finished product is often important to our customers, and QAD’s capabilities in traceability and serialization support this feature. QAD’s solutions are also used to support our customers’ environmental compliance needs.
 
Our focus on these six vertical markets gives us a competitive advantage by providing a solution developed specifically for our target customers, without the complexity and distraction of functionality they don’t want and don’t need. While some enterprise applications vendors provide broader solutions built for many industries, our narrow vertical focus allows our customers to implement with fewer configurations and customizations than our competitors require, which we believe typically results in less complex, and therefore lower cost and faster implementations. We leverage our vertical market expertise in research and development to meet specific industry needs: in sales, to understand our customer’s unique requirements; in presales, to demonstrate how these requirements are handled in the software; and in services, to apply best practices in optimization of business processes and implementation of the software. Our options to sell our product in the cloud or as on-premise licenses enable customers operating in multiple countries to choose a deployment option that best meets their unique needs.
 
QAD SOLUTIONS
 
QAD products and services support the business processes of global manufacturing companies in our target industries. We continually monitor emerging business requirements and practices as well as regulatory changes and incorporate them into our product and solutions strategies. Our development focus emphasizes user experience. We strive to deliver solutions that offer comprehensive capabilities while being easy to learn and use. Our goal is to make all capabilities that a particular user needs available with only a few clicks, giving our end users significant gains in efficiency as well as making the user experience more enjoyable.
 
Our Channel Islands program to develop a new user experience with enhanced usability for QAD Enterprise Applications is a new user interface (“UI”) written in HTML5 and accessible to the user with any standard browser. The new UI provides seamless access across desktops and mobile devices and has the ability to co-exist with our existing .NET UI. As part of the initiative to update the user experience, we restructured the underlying architecture of our solutions so the business logic and the user interface are separate layers. All business logic is now addressable through standard, documented application program interfaces (“APIs”), which provide the ability to integrate with third-party applications or to easily change the UI. 
 
One important advantage of the Channel Islands program has been a focus on modularity, providing the ability to upgrade the solution by suite, rather than upgrading the entire solution at one time. This makes upgrades smaller, faster and easier; helping customers stay on the most current version of our software which reduces the gap between their business needs and what our enterprise applications provide. The modularity allows us to improve the efficiency of our cloud operations using a simplified upgrade process. The Channel Islands program also supports the Internet of Things (“IoT”) where machines communicate with machines. An example of the power of the IoT is when our customers’ manufacturing equipment automatically updates our solution when products are completed, increasing accuracy and efficiency for the customer.
 
Smart phones and tablets continue to play an ever-increasing role in our day-to-day life, and our customers are embracing mobile computing to support more facets of their businesses. QAD delivers components of our solution for a variety of mobile platforms. Currently our mobile specific suite includes a requisition approval solution, a mobile business intelligence solution, mobile browse capability and mobile application monitoring tools to support system administrators. Our mobile browse capability allows users to view, filter and sort all data accessible through QAD browses within QAD Enterprise Applications using mobile devices.

In support of our focus on business process efficiency, we have integrated the ability to generate business process maps for common business processes into our software using the QAD Process Editor tool. This tool simplifies implementations, maps common business processes and facilitates navigation throughout the entire product suite. Within our suite, we have also embedded business process management (“QAD BPM”). QAD BPM allows customers to visualize their business processes; monitor transactional throughput by user, role or stage; and modify those processes to make them more efficient. Using QAD BPM, companies can create business process models, assign task responsibilities, monitor and re-direct workflow, all of which reduce process execution time, improve visibility of active processes, identify bottlenecks and support process improvement.
 
QAD developed its solutions to allow simple integration with other systems our customers use within their organizations. For example, we enable seamless integration between QAD Enterprise Applications and common browser applications and spreadsheets. QAD solutions also integrate easily with other web applications and web services. Using our Q-Xtend toolset, customers can connect to different software, even when remote, and they can use industry-standard middleware products such as the IBM MQ™ series or the standard connectors built on the Dell Boomi AtomSphere integration platform. Robust APIs along with QAD Automation Solutions provide additional capability for integration.
 
QAD Enterprise Applications
 
QAD Enterprise Applications is an integrated suite of software applications, which supports the core business processes of global manufacturing companies, and provides specific functionality to support the requirements of our targeted industries and the geographies in which our customers conduct business. QAD Enterprise Applications allows customers to monitor, control and support their operations, whether operating a single plant or multiple sites, wherever they are located around the world.
 
QAD Enterprise Applications has strong capabilities for addressing global complexities in customers’ business models, such as compliance with local accounting practices and legislation, as well as internal reporting on global performance. QAD Enterprise Applications includes full support for multiple currencies, multiple languages and complex corporate structures such as multiple companies or divisions.
 
QAD Enterprise Applications is available on premise, in the cloud and in a blended model combining both of these deployment alternatives by having certain sites on-premise and others in the cloud. Blended deployment enables users to transact easily across business entities with a consistent interface and consistent functionality since our cloud and on-premise technology is compatible. Companies that have chosen the cloud as a strategic direction but who cannot, or do not want to, move all locations at one time, find a blended deployment model allows them to transition to the cloud with less risk. The finance function can view individual business unit results and run consolidations that cross both cloud and on premise sites seamlessly, while other users can transact and view inventory in multiple locations irrespective of whether any specific business entity is operating in the cloud or on premise.

Within our current customer base, opportunities exist to deliver value through a wider use of the QAD product portfolio to address business challenges. With over 2,000 customers across our core vertical markets and over 300,000 active users, we have many opportunities to increase revenue and deliver additional value to our existing installed base. As the global manufacturing economy grows, our existing customers' businesses will grow and our solutions are designed to help them manage this growth in an effective and efficient manner. We intend to continue to invest aggressively in our direct sales and marketing capabilities to highlight these advantages for prospective new customers.
 
Continued product development and rapid response to change. Our ability to successfully compete depends in part on our continuous product development and rapid introduction of new technologies, features and functionality. Manufacturers are facing a swiftly changing business environment fueled by exponential growth in underlying technologies. Industry 4.0, IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing) and Digital Transformation are all examples of evolving technologies that can impact the markets in which our customers operate. Adopting these technologies, as well as responding to changes in customer demands and the competitive landscape, can require changes in our customer's business processes. Delivering agile systems that support changes in business process are a key focus of our Channel Islands program. The technologies that we have developed to provide this flexibility include: Personalization, Embedded Analytics, Modularization and Extensibility. We are committed to continuous investment in product development to ensure our products have the necessary capabilities to meet the needs of our global customers and enhance our competitive position in the vertical markets we serve. In particular, as our industry has shifted from on-premise to cloud-based solutions, we have expanded our cloud offerings to provide our customers with more value and flexibility.
 
Focus on global manufacturing and leverage expertise within key vertical markets. Many manufacturers operate globally, requiring a provider that can tailor solutions to the unique needs of their markets, deliver local and global services resources and support local languages. Solutions must be cost effective and easy to implement and use. Our solutions offer many benefits to customers with global operations, including capabilities that support operations in multiple geographies with a variety of languages, and currencies, as well as compliance with complex local regulations and business practices. Our existing global footprint is a key leverage point for meeting these needs, utilizing offices, personnel and partnerships in many countries around the world. We also employ staff with specific knowledge and experience in the industries in which our customers operate. We provide our solutions to 24 segments across six vertical manufacturing markets and we actively participate in several leading industry associations and pride ourselves on the deep expertise of our staff. Our industry knowledge continues to deepen through regular interaction with our customers. This collective experience and customer interaction allows QAD to develop solutions with specific capabilities that address our customers’ needs.

TECHNOLOGY
 
QAD Enterprise Applications was designed to achieve our vision for global manufacturing companies to effectively run their business processes at peak efficiency, in alignment with their company strategic goals. We have chosen the best technologies to achieve our vision, focusing on user experience, integration, business services, analytics, databases and deployment flexibility. We embrace ‘openness’ as a core principle of our designs, aiming to allow customers freedom of choice with regard to device, operating systems and hardware platforms when deploying their software applications. The core of QAD Enterprise Applications is built on a services-oriented architecture, which allows QAD Enterprise Applications’ components to communicate with one another through industry-standard messaging techniques like Representation State Transfer services. This allows customers to exploit the full benefit of QAD’s open architecture for their businesses.
 
QAD Enterprise Applications core business logic has been developed in the OpenEdge programming environment and relational database provided by Progress Software Corporation. Our solutions also include components of Oracle’s Java environment for providing web, mobile and integration infrastructure. We offer a rich user experience using HTML5 technologies, iOS, Android and Microsoft .NET frameworks. QAD Enterprise Applications supports most commercial operating systems, including most common LINUX-derived operating systems, Windows Server System and most proprietary versions of UNIX including Hewlett Packard’s HP/UX and IBM’s AIX. Where practical, QAD uses open industry standards to collaborate and integrate QAD Enterprise Applications with other systems.
 
QAD’s enterprise architecture provides significant flexibility for global companies in deploying QAD Enterprise Applications. Our enterprise architecture allows companies to separate the legal structure of their business from physical operating locations or to separate both of these from the software instances and computer hardware that support them. With QAD enterprise architecture, customers can choose which sites are a part of which companies, which sites are supported on any instance of the application, or which sites operate as one instance. Customers can also choose centralized, decentralized or hybrid computing architectures with parts of their enterprise running from both central resources and local resources.
 
QAD combines our technologies to provide a comprehensive cloud solution for our customers. Our cloud architecture encompasses infrastructure provisioning and application deployment, management, monitoring and security; providing a world class development operations practice built around Information Technology Infrastructure Library standards. Our cloud delivery centers are certified under the ISO 9001:2008 standard for quality management, the ISO 20,000:2011 standard for service management (SMS), the ISO 27001:2013 standard for information security management (ISMS), the FDA 21 CFR Part 11 requirements for electronic records and signatures, and the SSAE 16 (SOC I-Type II) requirements for reporting and compliance controls.
 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
 
The technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware, mobile devices, operating systems, applications, and the rapid expansion of the IoT. In addition, our customers and the industries that we support are continually evolving, as do their expectations of the performance and user experience of our software. We maintain a global research and development organization that provides new product enhancements to the market on a semiannual basis in order to swiftly respond to these changes.
 
The enterprise software industry is continuing its transition from selling on-premise licenses to selling cloud-based solutions which include more integration to IoT devices, social, mobile computing and platform services capabilities. In fiscal 2017, we continued to transition our business model to cloud-based offerings and we rolled out of our latest user experience in the sales, service and purchasing areas of the product suite to our cloud customers. Our latest release supports mobile applications for decision making and providing insights into the health of our customers businesses. This offering is designed to give our customers even more value and flexibility to use our product suite with a secure browser from anywhere the user has connectivity. We take security very seriously and with every new release we have our software verified by an outside firm through software scanning and penetration testing to ensure we have no security breaches. With our web services and rich set of API’s, our customers can connect our product suite to other applications with ease.

We dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to continually enhance and expand our product suite in support of the vertical markets that we serve. For example, in fiscal 2017, we continued our internationalization program in support of the expansion of our global customers. As we ended fiscal 2017 we were supporting our customers in over 70 countries with a single solution managed and maintained by QAD’s research and development organization. We added functionality in all areas of the product and have introduced a new Revenue Recognition Module in support of new accounting standards, ASC 606 and IFRS 15.
 
We operate a global research and development organization comprised of 380 R&D employees located in offices in the United States, India, China, Ireland, Australia, France, Belgium, Spain, Brazil and Great Britain. Our research and development expenses totaled $43.6 million, $41.2 million and $42.3 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our software is primarily developed internally; however, we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities when we require additional resources or specific skills or knowledge. All outside development is managed by our internal Research and Development organization. As needed, we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties. We continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining a competitive advantage to justify their costs. We routinely translate our product suite into fourteen languages and through our internationalization program we support mandatory governmental regulations and reporting requirements for over 70 countries. This is all accomplished through a single offering for our customers in the cloud or on premise, allowing them to run their businesses using a consistent core business model with a deployment model of their choice.
 
We plan to continue to manage significant product development operations internationally over the next several years. We believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development, lower costs, and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities. We continually assess the significant costs and challenges, including intellectual property protection, against the benefits of our international development activities.

DIRECT AND INDIRECT SALES
 
QAD sells its products and services through direct and indirect sales channels located throughout the regions of North America, Latin America, EMEA and Asia Pacific. Each region leverages global standards and systems to enhance consistency when interacting with global customers. Additionally, we have a global strategic accounts team, which is responsible for managing QAD’s largest global customers across regions. 
 
Our direct sales organization includes approximately 70 commissioned sales people. Incentive pay is a significant portion of the total compensation package for our sales staff. We continually align our sales organization and business strategies with market conditions to maintain an effective sales process. We cultivate the industries we serve within each territory through marketing, local product development and sales training.
 
Our indirect sales channel consists of approximately 40 distributors and sales agents worldwide. We do not grant exclusive rights to any of our distributors or sales agents. Our distributors and sales agents primarily sell independently to companies within their geographic territory, but may also work in conjunction with our direct sales organization. We also identify global sales opportunities through our relationships with implementation service providers, hardware vendors and other third parties.
 
MARKETING
 
Our marketing strategy is to differentiate our offering by focusing on our role in providing value by helping our customers achieve the vision of the Effective Enterprise. Our main marketing objective is to leverage the measurable success in business outcomes our customers have achieved to increase awareness and drive leads. We do this by openly and consistently communicating with QAD customers, prospects, partners, investors and other key audiences. Our primary marketing activities include: press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, offerings and value proposition; user conferences and events, such as Explore, as well as participation in other industry events, to create customer and prospect awareness; content marketing and engagement on social channels like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube; search engine optimization, retargeting and pay per click advertising to drive traffic to our web properties; web site development and gamification to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through product information and demonstrations, case studies, white papers, and marketing collateral; customer testimonials, references, and referrals; and sales tools and field marketing events to enable our sales organization to more effectively convert leads into customers.
 
We recognize the changing buying dynamics and are focused on engaging with prospects early in the sales cycle in order to help set the buying criteria and specifications in a way that uniquely leads to QAD. We seek to accelerate prospects through the buying journey by answering questions and removing roadblocks.

COMPETITION
 
Every aspect of our business is affected by strong competition from both enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application services providers. The markets for our on-premise and cloud offerings continue to rapidly evolve due to constant changes in technology. New products and services are frequently introduced as new companies emerge and expand. Our customers demand greater performance and reliability with lower complexity. Cost of implementation or conversion to the cloud and cost of ongoing maintenance are constant concerns when our customers make decisions about how best to deploy their resources.
 
In the on-premise space, we compete primarily with larger enterprise application vendors, such as SAP, Oracle and Infor, who hold significant market share in the traditional marketplace. These companies have considerable financial resources and name recognition and have established broad market solutions by developing applications targeted at many industries, not just manufacturing. They often focus heavily on positioning their size as an advantage. We typically differentiate against these companies based on the specific industry focus of our solutions as well as our customer focus. Internationally, we face competition from local companies, as well as the large enterprise application competitors, many of which have products tailored for those local markets.
 
In addition, our industry has shifted focus from on-premise to cloud and mobile computing. Most enterprise application vendors today have some focus on cloud solutions, in addition to on-premise sales, which creates an environment in which we face competition from a variety of vendors that address one or more of our applications. As a result, our cloud solutions compete with both large software vendors and cloud computing application service providers. Smaller cloud computing vendors have so far targeted the lower end of the manufacturing supply chain market where companies operate in a single plant or single currency environment focusing mainly in the U.S. domestic market. Adding to this, other vendors that provide services in different markets may develop solutions in our target markets and some potential customers may elect to develop their own internal solutions. 
 
We believe the key competitive factors in our markets are:
 

● | Customer focus
--+---------------


● | Customer outcomes
--+------------------


● | Flexibility to meet changing business requirements
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Total cost of ownership
--+------------------------


● | Performance and reliability
--+----------------------------


● | Security
--+---------


● | Solution breadth and functionality
--+-----------------------------------


● | Technological innovation
--+-------------------------


● | Usability
--+----------


● | Ability to tailor and customize series for a specific company, vertical or industry
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compatibility between products and services deployed within on-premise IT environments and public cloud IT environments
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Speed and ease of deployment, use and maintenance; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | Financial resources and reputation of the vendor.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. Our ability to remain competitive will depend on our efforts in the areas of product development and sales, services and support operations.
