Joey New York
 
Joey New York product lines include skin care treatments and beauty enhancements that are health conscious, effective and affordable.  In keeping with our beauty mission, we have utilized the water from tender young green coconuts, blended with Indian ginseng extract, into our new fast-acting QUICK RESULTS skincare collection.
 
The Company seeks to increase market share and introduce its product line through multiple channel markets.  The Company faces competition from nationally recognized firms that may have greater resources of personnel, capitalization, and reputation.  The Company has therefore concentrated its efforts on product quality and performance.
 
Principal Products
 



In the early 1990's the Joey New York brand pioneered the "instant visible results spa at home concept" and was the innovator of producing products that were deemed "the safe alternatives to painful, costly dermatological procedures", selling beauty products to the prestige market.
 
Skincare expert and Founder Joey Chancis has reinvented the Joey New York brand.  One of the new and recently launched collections is the quick results coconut water product.  These products are designed to deliver amazing results in a healthy new way with the help of one of nature's most healing, soothing ingredients: Young Green Tender Coconut Water.
 
Joey New York® formulates and develops trendsetting products that don't currently exist and fills a void in today's marketplace.  Joey is known for creating new market niches by constantly launching innovative new products utilizing the latest skin care technology and best raw materials available on the planet.  Joey New York® products are designed for at home use as topicals which are marketed to be safe, less expensive alternatives to sometimes painful dermatological procedures or spa treatments such as facial peels and fillers.
 
The Joey New York® product line is a curated collection of "Hero Items" that instantly address specific skin needs from blackheads to wrinkles to rosacea and beyond.  These products are not meant to compete with other skin care products or brands on the market, but to complement them.
 
They are specifically designed to amplify any skin care regimen enhancing results dramatically.  The Quick Results® collection represents the culmination of 20+ years of experience in formulation and meeting the needs of Joey's loyal customers.  All products have been created with the "health conscious", ingredient savvy, and results-oriented consumer in mind.
 
THE COCONUT REVOLUTION: The Hawaiians call Coconut Water "NEOLANI" which means "Dew from the Heavens".  Through new technology, Joey New York® has formulated Coconut Water harvested from young, tender, green coconuts and integrated it with other active ingredients to develop its Quick Results® collection of skin care products.
 
Many Latin American women take great interest in preserving their youthful appearances and good health.  A long kept daily "lifestyle" secret is their use of Coconut Water both topically and internally. Fresh Coconut Water offers unparalleled nutritional value that is rich in vitamins, minerals and protein.  It provides trace amounts of Calcium, Potassium, Folic Acid, Magnesium and Zinc, as well as protein for added moisturization to the skin.  Coconut Water naturally replenishes the skin with these nutrients restoring a healthy, youthful glow.
 
Marketing & Distribution Methods
 
SALES AND MARKETING STRATEGY.  Joey New York® will directly target certain vertical markets primarily driven by age, education and the demand for health and natural products.  Positioning is determined by developing small collections as opposed to being too "SKU" intensive in one category allowing diversity of product amongst a cross-section of the consumer base.  Joey fills a void in the market with items that previously were nonexistent and continually expanding a foothold in this space.  Efforts focused on advertising, editorial events, and training will help Joey remain relevant and current while being an innovative visionary.  Also, Joey will capitalize on retail relationships in the founder's rolodex developed through past commercial success.
 
SALES AND SUPPORT RESOURCES:  At present Joey Chancis is responsible for overseeing approximately 2,000 accounts in the professional and salon industry, as well as, boutique chain stores in the U.S.  Some of these stores have sold Joey's original collection in the past.  Joey also has retained freelance independent contractors that are strategically placed in key territories around the country who are always available to train, sell or provide services when needed.

Background of Industry & Market Analysis
 
THE GLOBAL COSMECEUTICALS INDUSTRY: The global cosmetics market was approximately $233 billion in 2012 and is expected to reach $292 billion worldwide by 2017 with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4.6%. Cosmeceuticals are capturing an ever-growing share of this market from 13% in 2012 to an expected market share of 16% in 2017 with "skin care" cosmeceuticals as the largest vertical market dominating the category with a 60% share. Despite the ongoing economic difficulties in many parts of the world, the beauty industry continues to defy the downturn. NPD, R&D and the creation of new brands in the beauty sector is outperforming many other consumer industries and the outlook from analysts is largely positive.
 
"The resilience of the beauty industry is clear to see," says Mary-Ellen Field, Chairman of Brand Finance.  "If you compare it to other industries it's holding up very well.  Fashion for instance, with the exception of a few retailers, is really suffering."
 
The beauty industry's ability to weather the financial storm can be attributed to a number of factors: burgeoning consumerism in developing markets is providing demand for personal care and cosmetic products; while in more mature markets spending on discretionary items such as beauty products has increased at the expense of the bigger ticket items. Luxury brands, in particular, have enjoyed a renewed uptake.
 
Leading business intelligence provider GBI Research states that the global cosmeceuticals market will be driven by "technological advances and consumer awareness" and will "boost commercial potential for innovative and premium-priced products" through 2018.  GBI found that the global cosmeceuticals market was estimated to be worth $30.9 billion in 2011, having grown at a CAGR of 3.6% from $24.1 billion in 2004 and trending to conservatively reach $36.88 billion by 2016.  In 2011, the top five European countries accounted for almost 65% of the overall cosmeceuticals market, followed by the US as the single largest market.  This is mainly driven by the obsession with maintaining a youthful appearance, better results of cosmeceuticals, heavy marketing, slow economic improvement, and rising per-capita disposable income.
 
Cosmeceutical brand growth is further driven by expanded markets in Asia-Pacific, digital marketing and the offer of personalized customer experiences and e-commerce.  Demand is driven by the emergence of the urban middle class with increased incomes, affordability and urbanization who demand efficient products and luxury brands. Anti-oxidants remain one of the most popular ingredients for skin care and are now being included in other healthcare regimens for their perceived benefits to overall health.

Government Regulation
 
The two most important laws pertaining to cosmetics marketed in the United States are the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA). FDA regulates cosmetics under the authority of these laws.
 
The FD&C Act defines cosmetics by their intended use, as "articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body...for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance" (FD&C Act, sec. 201(i)).  Among the products included in this definition are skin moisturizers, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail polishes, eye and facial makeup, cleansing shampoos, permanent waves, hair colors, and deodorants, as well as any substance intended for use as a component of a cosmetic product.

The FD&C Act prohibits the marketing of adulterated or misbranded cosmetics in interstate commerce.  "Adulteration" refers to violations involving product composition--whether they result from ingredients, contaminants, processing, packaging, or shipping and handling.  "Misbranding" refers to violations involving improperly labeled or deceptively packaged products. Under the FD&C Act, a product also may be misbranded due to failure to provide material facts.  This means, for example, any directions for safe use and warning statements needed to ensure a product's safe use.
 
In addition, under the authority of the FPLA, FDA requires a list of ingredients for cosmetics marketed on a retail basis to consumers (Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), section 701.3).  Cosmetics that fail to comply with the FPLA are considered misbranded under the FD&C Act. (FPLA, section 1456). This requirement does not apply to cosmetics distributed solely for professional use, institutional use (such as in schools or the workplace), or as free samples or hotel amenities.
 
FDA can take action against cosmetics on the market that are in violation of these laws, as well as companies and individuals who market such products.
 
FDA's legal authority over cosmetics is different from their authority over other products they regulate, such as drugs, biologics, and medical devices.  Under the law, cosmetic products and ingredients do not need FDA premarket approval, with the exception of color additives.  However, FDA can pursue enforcement action against products on the market that are not in compliance with the law, or against firms or individuals who violate the law.
 
We follow best practices guidelines and utilize quality suppliers that comply with all regulatory requirements.

We do not incur any significant costs resulting from our operations to comply with environmental Laws.
 
Employees
 
The Company currently has a total of three officers and employees including its corporate management, sales and operational employees. We also have two non-executive directors.
