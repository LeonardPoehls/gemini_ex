Cloud Computing
 
Gawk’s Cloud Computing service centralizes information management, hardware, network and infrastructure in an off-premise location, hosted and managed by Gawk. Offered as private, hybrid or community solutions, Gawk’s secure offerings drive efficiencies in both costs and resources allowing for rapid scalability and deployment of applications. These offerings provide a predictable, utility-based OpEx model, which eliminates significant capital expenditures, removes obsolescence concerns and future-proofs customer investments.
 
Cloud-Based Storage
 
Gawk offers a solution that addresses the explosive growth of data across all industries with a cost-effective and secure storage solution hosted in the cloud. This scalable, fully redundant solution is hosted off-premise, reduces customer data center footprints and resource requirements, and facilitates additional SaaS solutions that can be accommodated on the same cloud platform. Gawk delivers a storage and data back-up assessment service as part of its storage offering, measuring growth and duplication benchmarked against best practices. The solution consolidates requirements across the enterprise, increases efficiency and achieves economies of scale designed to reduce overall customer costs.
 
Service Plans
 
Gawk’s business communications services generally offer several different service packages designed to meet specific customer needs and requirements. Base level plans offer a basic service package for a low monthly recurring charge. Additional charges, such as SIP, PBX, wireless, security or network consulting are charges on an individual case basis. Optional value-added features for basic services are available for an incremental monthly charge appropriate for the service. Cloud connectivity services such as In Building Internet access services and/or private line services are charged on a fixed monthly basis, and are generally based on the bandwidth utilized and the endpoints involved. Cloud computing services are based on a utility pricing model, and charges for managed cloud solutions are generally composed of an upfront charge and a monthly recurring charge. Gawk’s business customer contracts range from one to five years.
Network
 
Gawk operates a robust and reliable carrier-grade network and infrastructure that delivers high quality, diverse and secure connections to our Cloud services. Our Managed Network Services, Internet Access, Ethernet, Fiber and Cloud based solutions can be provided either on-net leveraging our own extensive network, or off-net using the networks of our carrier partners, for truly diverse and redundant connections.
 
Our Data Center and Business Services network operations centers are highly automated and monitored 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Our centers employ state-of-the-art monitoring and alert systems that are designed to ensure quality of service and a proactive response to potential customer service issues.
 
The Gawk network is characterized by its low cost of deployment and low recurring costs. It has been constructed to meet actual, rather than speculative, customer demand with on-net and off-net connections to provide ubiquitous access, delivering maximum cost efficiency without sacrificing quality. Our robust network is designed as a fully meshed OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) running BGP with multiple peers. OSPF automatically detects changes in the topology, such as link failures, and selects a new routing structure within seconds.
 
Gawk’s centralized network elements are housed in carrier-grade facilities located in secure carrier buildings that house many other carriers and are interconnected to other major carrier buildings. These locations allow for cost-effective and rapid interconnection and capacity expansion to carrier customers, as well as major enterprise customers. Gawk believes its selected locations and equipment choices provide the platform required to support its envisioned growth and will allow it to quickly embrace emerging technologies as they become commercially available and viable.

Cloud Services Platform
 
Our custom Cloud services platform was designed and developed by our own team of experienced technicians with many years using advanced, yet proven technology. This platform is scalable, flexible and secure, delivering an integrated portfolio of Cloud-based communications services that enable businesses of every size to increase productivity and efficiency while controlling costs. Information management, hardware, network and infrastructure are centralized off-premise, hosted and managed by us, allowing customers to rapidly adjust to fluctuating and unpredictable service demands, drive efficiencies in staff and space, and eliminate the need for costly technology upgrades. The architecture of our platform has been designed to allow for the seamless integration of additional Cloud-based applications, whether or not developed by Gawk. Gawk’s custom platform allows faster, easier, more cost-effective introduction of new, business-critical applications, delivering a unique feature set engineered to quickly respond to customer demands and market requirements. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by combining our robust carrier-grade network services to enable secure connections to the Cloud, delivering true diversity and a fully integrated solution for maximum efficiency and cost savings.
 
Our custom platform has been engineered using advanced technologies, best of breed equipment and provides for redundancy, fault tolerance and future geographical diversity. The platform has been designed for scalability as well as resiliency, and can be easily expanded to accommodate any required number of connections and customers. Platform solutions are location and device neutral, serving multiple as well as single locations nationwide, connecting users to customers and other employees on desktops, laptops, handsets, tablets and mobile phones, wherever they may be. The platform is currently deployed in our Irvine data center; the platform has a fully functional, redundant system whose services can be replicated at additional locations in a cost effective and timely manner. Thus, should one of the data centers be hit with a catastrophic event, customers should experience no interruption of service. The result is to ensure a proven, reliable and consistent uptime, which is crucial for delivering mission critical solutions.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We market and sell our business services to small, medium and large customers through distribution partners, direct sales personnel and inside sales representatives. Our independent distribution partners are typically paid commissions based on their sales and, thereafter, the continued use of our services by the customers sold by them. Our sales employees, including direct sales and inside sales, are typically compensated through a combination of base salary and commissions based on their actual sales performance.
 
Our distribution partners generally target smaller- to medium- size businesses, while our direct sales force focuses on the larger enterprise customers in our targeted verticals. We believe that our Cloud platform, infrastructure, systems and connectivity provide a strong competitive advantage in serving these larger enterprise customers, creating real value with specialized solutions that meet their more complex and rigorous requirements. Referrals, strategic relationships and the strength of our corporate relationships are also a key part of our overall sales and marketing plan. We believe that the substantial experience and relationships of our executives and directors will assist us in organically growing our business through the addition of new customers.
 
Strategy
 
Our recent acquisitions and improved financial performance are important milestones in our strategic roadmap as we work to become the industry’s leading and most successful cloud services provider. Our plans for growth are supported by an experienced and tested management team and dedicated staff, our advanced cloud services platforms, and leading edge systems and infrastructure. We believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our strategy to organically grow our revenue from the Business Services segment, develop vertically oriented solutions and acquire additional cloud services companies.
 
Gawk intends to grow organically through direct as well as indirect channel sales efforts; by securing large strategic distribution partners to extend our geographic and vertical market reach; through the up-sale and cross-sale of services to our existing customer base; and by leveraging management, Board and shareholder relationships to help penetrate larger enterprises.

We intend to increasingly focus our sales and marketing efforts on developing vertically oriented solutions for targeted markets that require the kind of specialized solutions made possible by our state-of-the-art network and advanced services platforms. Our vertically oriented solutions offer a substantial opportunity to gain market share.
 
Competition
 
Each of Gawk’s business segments are highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and subject to constant technological change. In each of our business segments, we compete with companies that are significantly larger and have substantially greater market presence, financial, technical, operational and marketing resources than we do. In the event that such a competitor expends significant sales and marketing resources in one or several markets where we compete with them, we may not be able to compete successfully in those markets. Specialized cloud services providers, who focus on one or more cloud service or application, could adopt aggressive pricing and promotion practices that could impact our ability to compete. We also believe that competition will continue to increase, placing downward pressure on prices. Such pressure could adversely affect our gross margins if we are not able to reduce our costs commensurate with the price reductions of our competitors. Further, the pace of technological change makes it impossible for us to predict whether we will face new competitors using different technologies to provide the same or similar services offered or proposed to be offered by us. If our competitors were to provide better and more cost effective services than ours, we may not be able to increase our revenues or capture any significant market share.
Employees
 
As of January 31, 2017, we had 11 full time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good, and, to date, we have not experienced a work stoppage.

· | “Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) continues to hold the lead in market share for cloud infrastructure services despite competition from Microsoft, according to latest figures from Synergy Research. The research, which examines infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), private and hybrid cloud, sees AWS’ overall share at 28%, compared to Microsoft’s 10%, IBM at 7%, Google at 5%, Salesforce 4%, and Rackspace 3%. Year on year growth saw Microsoft (96%) and Google (88%) the biggest climbers, with Amazon (51%) and IBM (48%) holding steady.

· | Comparative figures from Synergy in previous quarters have shown Microsoft strive to claim second position in the cloud infrastructure market, with AWS way out in front. Many actual or perceived barriers to cloud adoption have now been removed, and the worldwide market is on a strong growth trajectory.” Source: By James Bourne 03 February 2015, Cloudtech, www. cloudcomputing-news.net 

  
AWS continues to be the provider of choice for the large enterprise customer however; the cost to scale AWS instances can be prohibitively expensive even in the wake of recent price cuts. Price sensitive customers and knowledgeable IT professions find that the cost to grow infrastructure and the ability to migrate to another platform from AWS is a major concern. The Cloud services we offer are flexible, secure, and highly portable while simultaneously price completive in the market place.
 
Our latest Cloud offering frees us from proprietary third party hardware and the associated cost constraints to our growth. We continue to enjoy our long standing relationships with companies like cPanel, Microsoft, Spam Experts and the Irvine Company. We welcome recent relationships with OnApp, WHMCS and Level3 .
