Item 1. Business.
Our Company and Corporate History
 
We were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 11, 2012 under the name Aviana, Corp.  Our original business was a Poland based corporation that operated a consulting business in EMF (electromagnetic fields), Microwave, Electrical and Ionizing detection, shielding and protection in Poland. We were unsuccessful in operating our business and on August 27, 2013 we entered into a binding letter of intent with EmployUS, Ltd. (“EmployUS”). It was in connection with that letter of intent that our prior officer and director, Liudmila Yuziuk, resigned and we appointed Mr. Brian McLoone as our sole officer and director. In addition, we changed our name to The Staffing Group Ltd. to better represent our new business operations.
 
On January 22, 2014, we entered into the Exchange Agreement with EmployUS which agreement closed on February 14, 2014.  Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the final, fully executed Exchange Agreement, and upon the consummation of the closing: 
 

● | Each share of EmployUS’s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Exchange Agreement was converted into the right to receive an aggregate of 263,076 shares of our common stock.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Three of our shareholders agreed to cancel the following shares:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


(i) | Joseph Albunio agreed to cancel 167,728 shares of his common stock. After the cancellation he owns 10,000 shares of our common stock.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | Brian McLoone agreed to cancel 56,728 shares of his common stock. After the cancellation he owns 121,000 shares of our common stock.
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | Luidmila Yuziuk agreed to cancel 38,619 shares of her common stock. After the cancellation, she does not own any shares of our common stock.
------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Following the Exchange Agreement, there were 702,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, which included 263,076 shares held by former stockholders of EmployUS and 121,000 by Brian McLoone, EmployUS’s Chief Operations Officer and The Staffing Group, Ltd’s Chief Executive Officer, but not a stockholder of EmployUS prior to the merger. As a result, the Company’s pre-merger stockholders, excluding Brian McLoone, held approximately 45.28% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock and the former stockholder of EmployUS, including Brian McLoone, held approximately 54.72%.
 
The Exchange Agreement was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization and EmployUS was deemed to be the acquirer in the reverse merger for accounting purposes. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations of the Company that are reflected in the financial statements prior to the closing are those of EmployUS, and the consolidated financial statements of the Company after completion of the reverse merger will include the assets and liabilities of EmployUS, historical operations of EmployUS and operations of EmployUS from the Closing Date of the Exchange Agreement.

Since December 31, 2015, to grow our business, we have employed a professional selling branch manager and administrative support staff at the Montgomery branch. The Company plans an aggressive expansion throughout the Southeast U.S. whereby we will open additional branches. We expect to incorporate a new company each time we open a new branch. The startup capital for each branch is expected to be raised by crowdfunding with new investor ownership limited to 49% of each branch.
 
Our Industry
 
We are primarily focused in the on-demand blue collar staffing industry. The primary placements we make are to companies in the construction industry, light industrial, refuse industry, retail, and hospitality businesses.
 
In addition, the Company is actively sourcing acquisition targets in the staffing industry. While our current focus is blue collar staffing, we are seeking acquisition opportunities in every staffing vertical segment with planned targets in IT Staffing, home healthcare, professional firms and disaster response.
 
Products and Services
 
We are a service provider that is in the business of providing temporary staffing solutions. We provide general laborers to construction, light industrial, refuse, retail, and hospitality businesses and recruit, hire, train and manage skilled workers so our clients doesn’t have to. By eliminating the administrative requirements of finding and employing skilled and unskilled workers our clients have the ability to focus on the important task of managing and growing their business and not worry about staffing their projects. We currently operate five branch locations.
 
Additionally, we plan to seek out acquisition targets in other segments of the staffing industry as we execute an aggressive buy and build roll-up strategy to grow our business. 
 
Seasonality of the Business
 
Generally, we expect our revenues to be higher and gross margin percent to be higher during the second and third fiscal quarters as compared to the first and fourth fiscal quarters each year. During the second and third quarters we receive the majority of our contracts to supply labor to construction firms. Contracts for construction work tends to be both larger in dollar amount and to be more profitable than our other contracts.
 
Concentration or Dependence on Key Vendors, Suppliers or Clients
 
We, are not dependent on any single supplier or client. From time to time, we may experience high customer concentration, especially in our busier quarterly periods.
Marketing
 
After the split-off transaction of the EmployUS assets and liabilities on December 31, 2015, our marketing efforts have changed to be more focused on attracting acquisition targets, in line with our new focus of growth by acquisitions. As we acquire new staffing businesses, we intend to analyze each business to determine the best mix of marketing expenditures to maximize return on investment. We anticipate that online and social media marketing will become a large part of our marketing efforts. Additionally, we intend to rely on telemarketing and direct mail as a means to market the services. We use licensed customer relationship management software to manage new leads and opportunities. This software allows us to automate many marketing functions and will be more relied upon as we scale up our business.

Competition
 
The staffing industry is highly competitive and fragmented throughout the United States.  There are multiple staffing companies that fill a wide variety of positions and service a wide variety of industries. There is no one company dominant in the temporary staffing industry, however, there are several large competitors with substantially more resources and market visibility than us. The Company believes that the primary factors in obtaining and retaining customers are the cost of services, the quality of employees provided, the responsiveness of service, and the number of markets that can be serviced.
 
Regulatory Matters/Compliance
 
We are not aware of any need for any government approval of our principal services. We do not anticipate any governmental regulations on our business. However, we do provide workers compensation insurance for all our employees and we must ensure we are adhering to all OSHA requirements.  We are responsible for all federal, state and local taxes for our employees.  When working in a port all employees must have a T.W.I.C. identification card which ensures they are authorized to work in heightened security atmosphere.  Employees that work on federally funded projects have their wages determined and validated by the federal government based on The Davis Bacon Act.
