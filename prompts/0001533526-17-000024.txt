Item 1. Business.
Our Company
Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware on October 10, 2007. Holdings, through its wholly-owned principal operating subsidiary, Global Brass and Copper, Inc. (“GBC”), commenced commercial operations on November 19, 2007 following the acquisition of the metals business from Olin Corporation. The majority of our operations are managed through three reportable operating segments: Olin Brass, Chase Brass and A.J. Oster. We also have a Corporate entity which includes certain administrative costs and expenses and the elimination of intercompany balances. Our sales activities are primarily focused in North America under the Olin Brass, Chase Brass and A.J. Oster brand names.
We are a leading, value-added converter, fabricator, processor and distributor of specialized non-ferrous products, including a wide range of sheet, strip, foil, rod, tube and fabricated metal component products. While we primarily process copper and copper alloys, we also reroll and form certain other metals such as stainless steel, carbon steel and aluminum. Using processed scrap, virgin metals and other refined metals, we engage in metal melting and casting, rolling, drawing, extruding, welding and stamping to fabricate finished and semi-finished alloy products. Key attributes of copper and copper alloys are conductivity, corrosion resistance, strength, malleability, cosmetic appearance and bactericidal properties. 
Our products are used in a variety of applications across diversified markets, including the building and housing, munitions, automotive, transportation, coinage, electronics / electrical components, industrial machinery and equipment and general consumer markets. We access these markets through direct mill sales, our captive distribution network and third-party distributors. We hold the exclusive production and distribution rights in North America for a lead-free brass rod product, which we sell under the Green Dot® and Eco Brass® brand names. The vertical integration of Olin Brass’s manufacturing capabilities and A.J. Oster’s distribution capabilities allows us to access customers with a wide variety of volume and service needs.
We service nearly 1,600 customers in 28 countries across four continents. We employ approximately 1,850 people and operate 11 manufacturing facilities and distribution centers across the United States (“U.S.”), Puerto Rico and Mexico.
We own 80% of a value-added service center in Guangzhou, China (“Olin Luotong Metals” or “OLM”); the other 20% is owned by Chinalco Luoyang Copper Co. Ltd. (“Chinalco”). Through Olin Luotong Metals, together with our sales offices in China and Singapore, we supply our products in China and throughout Asia. 
Unlike traditional metals companies, in particular those that engage in mining, smelting and refining activities, we are purely a metal converter, fabricator, processor and distributor, and we do not attempt to generate profits from fluctuations in metal prices. Our financial performance is primarily driven by metal conversion economics, not by the underlying movements in the price of copper and the other metals we use. Through our “balanced book” approach (as further described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Business Principles Affecting Our Results of Operations —Balanced Book”), we strive to match the timing, quantity and price of our metal sales with the timing, quantity and price of our replacement metal purchases. This practice, along with our toll processing operations and last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) inventory accounting methodology, substantially reduces the financial impact of metal price movements on our earnings and operating margins.

All of our segments sell to the building and housing market. While demand within this market is affected by new residential housing, existing home sales and commercial construction, all of which are seasonal and dependent on overall economic conditions, the correlation between housing statistics and our sales is not entirely direct. Our key products are typically installed near the completion of construction, meaning there is an inherent lag time compared to housing starts, and sales of our building and housing products can be affected by factors such as housing mix (unit size, unit price point and the mix of multi-family versus single-family construction). Sales of our products can also be impacted by changes in the composition of materials and fixtures used in construction as well as import and export dynamics.
The following charts show the percentage of our shipments by segment, as well as the primary markets for our products and the percentage of shipments. Pounds shipped by market represent management’s estimate of the markets in which our customers participate. Additionally, pounds shipped by market reflect our allocation of Chase Brass shipments to distributors, job shops and forging shops. See Item 1, “Business—Chase Brass.”

In addition to manufacturing, fabricating and converting specialized copper and brass sheet, strip, foil, tube and fabricated products, the Olin Brass segment also rerolls and forms other alloys such as stainless steel, carbon steel and aluminum. Sheet and strip is generally manufactured from copper and copper-alloy scrap.
Olin Brass manufactures its wide variety of products through four sites in North America. It is not uncommon for Olin Brass to produce 50 different alloys, approximately 30% of which could be high performance alloys (“HPAs”). 
Olin Brass’s integrated brass mill in East Alton, Illinois is its main operating facility, which melts metal and produces strip products that are either sold directly to external customers, sold to its affiliate, A.J. Oster, or shipped to Olin Brass’s downstream operations for further value-added processing. Olin Brass’s downstream operations include:

• | a stamping operation located in East Alton;


• | a rolling mill in Waterbury, Connecticut with rolling, annealing, leveling, plating and slitting capabilities for various products (“Somers Thin Strip”), including stainless steel thin strip;


• | a manufacturing facility in Bryan, Ohio specializing in products sold in the automotive and electronics / electrical components markets; and


• | a manufacturing facility in Cuba, Missouri that produces high frequency welded copper-alloy tube for heat transfer, utility, decorative, automotive and plumbing applications.

Olin Brass’s products are sold to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), other external customers, distributors / rerollers or to its affiliate, A.J. Oster. In 2016, approximately 18% of Olin Brass’s products were shipped to distribution customers, which includes its affiliate A.J. Oster, of which management estimates that approximately 55% were directly associated with the building and housing and automotive sectors. In 2016, approximately 15% of Olin Brass’s domestic copper-based shipments were to A.J. Oster.

Demand within this market is affected by consumer spending on electronics, which may fluctuate significantly as a result of economic conditions.
International
The Olin Brass segment sold 18.3 million pounds into non-U.S. markets that primarily serve the building and housing, automotive and electronics / electrical components markets. 
Asia
Included within our Olin Brass business, our Asian operations provide service, distribution and sales activities to meet the growing demand for copper alloys in that region. These activities are conducted through two of our subsidiaries, Olin Luotong Metals (“OLM”) in China and GBC Metals Asia Pacific PTE (“GMAP”) in Singapore. These operations source materials from Olin Brass, as well as other copper and brass mills, such as Chinalco and DOWA Metaltech Co. LTD (“Dowa Metaltech”). In 2016, these Asian operations generated $37.1 million of net sales, or 6% of the Olin Brass segment’s net sales. On a pounds basis, our Asian operations sold 9.8 million pounds (4% of the Olin Brass segment’s sales) of product into Asia through OLM and GMAP, primarily into key electronics markets. 
Others
The remainder of Olin Brass’s international sales are primarily to Mexico, Canada and European countries and were 8.5 million pounds (3% of the Olin Brass segment’s sales) in 2016.
Chase Brass
Chase Brass primarily manufactures brass rod, including round, hexagonal and other shapes, ranging from 1/4 inch to 4 1/2 inches in diameter. Its customers machine or otherwise process the rod for various applications used in various markets. Brass rod is primarily used for forging and machining products, such as valves and fittings. Key attributes of brass rod include its machinability, corrosion resistance and moderate strength. Brass rod is generally manufactured from copper or copper-alloy scrap and all of Chase Brass’s rod is manufactured at its Montpelier, Ohio facility. 
Chase Brass has been able to capitalize on opportunities arising from regulation limiting lead content in potable water plumbing fixtures. The green product portfolio has grown significantly over the past few years as customers switch from leaded to non or low-leaded products in certain applications. We expect increased demand in the building and housing market to drive growth in our green product portfolio, including Eco Brass®, given the enactment of these regulations.

The demand within this market is affected by consumer spending and trends in electronics, which may fluctuate significantly as a result of economic conditions.
International
A.J. Oster operates a service center in central Mexico. The facility is located in Queretaro in the center of Mexico’s industrial triangle marked by Mexico City, Monterey and Guadalajara and is easily accessible by highway connections to the U.S.
Automotive sub-suppliers that consume copper-alloy strip are now locating facilities in central Mexico in order to support primary automotive manufacturing.
Net sales from A.J. Oster Mexico were $39.8 million during 2016 (14% of A.J. Oster segment’s net sales). Pounds shipped from A.J. Oster Mexico were 10.4 million and comprised 14% of the A.J. Oster segment’s sales.
Raw Materials and Supply
We manufacture our products from scrap metal (both internally generated and externally sourced) or virgin raw materials. During 2016, 91% of our metal came from scrap metal, and the remainder came from virgin raw materials. 
Virgin raw materials, including copper cathode, are purchased at a premium on the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) or Commodities Exchange (“COMEX”) or directly from key dealers that support producers around the world. Although virgin raw materials are more expensive compared to scrap, we use them to produce HPAs and other products that require exact specifications.
Customers
Our customer base is broadly diversified, spanning various North American markets, including building and housing, munitions, automotive, transportation, coinage, electronics / electrical components, industrial machinery and equipment and general consumer markets. In 2016, we sold approximately 14,000 different stock keeping units (“SKUs”) to nearly 1,600 customers.
8

Also in 2016, net sales from our foreign entities were $76.9 million, or 6% of our net sales. We have long-term relationships with our customers, many of which are secured through short-term contracts. Our relationships with many of our significant customers have lasted more than 30 years.
All three of our operating segments had customers to whom sales activity constituted more than 10% of net sales during 2016. Olin Brass generated 23% of its total net sales from one customer and 11% of its total net sales from another customer. A.J. Oster generated 18% of its total net sales from one customer. Chase Brass generated 21% of its total net sales from one customer. On a consolidated basis, we did not generate more than 10% of our net sales from any one customer in 2016.
Competition
We compete with other companies on price, service, quality, breadth, and availability of product. We believe we have been able to compete effectively because of our high levels of service, breadth of product offering, knowledgeable and trained sales force, modern equipment, numerous locations, geographic dispersion and economies of scale.
The North American market for brass and copper strip and sheet and brass rod consists of a few large participants and a few smaller competitors for Olin Brass and Chase Brass. A.J. Oster’s competition consists of a number of smaller competitors. Our international competitors are based principally in Europe and Asia.
Our largest competitors in each of the markets in which we operate are the following:


• | Aurubis and PMX Industries, Inc.: manufacturers of copper and copper-alloys in the form of strip, sheet and plate (Olin Brass competitor);


• | ThyssenKrupp Materials NA, Copper and Brass Sales Division: processor and distributor of copper, brass, stainless and aluminum products; Wieland Metals, Inc.: re-roll mill and service center for copper and copper-alloy strip (A.J. Oster competitor); and


• | Mueller Industries, Inc.: manufacturer of brass rod (Chase Brass competitor).

We use data published by independent industry associations and management estimates to determine our market share. Using this information, in 2016:


• | Olin Brass accounted for 32% of North American shipments (including shipments to A.J. Oster) of copper and brass alloys in the form of sheet, strip and plate;


• | A.J. Oster accounted for 35% of North American shipments of copper and brass, sheet and strip products from distribution centers and rerolling facilities; and


• | Chase Brass accounted for 54% of North American shipments of brass rod, not including imports.

Corporate

Corporate also includes interest expense, state and federal income taxes, overhead costs that management has not allocated to the operating segments, share-based compensation expense, gains and losses associated with certain acquisitions and dispositions and the elimination of intercompany sales and balances.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
Bactericidal Products
Through its membership in the Copper Development Association Inc. (“CDA”), Olin Brass has completed the required Federal Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and applicable state registration processes that allow it to market its CuVerro® products with certain approved bactericidal claims. Laboratory testing has shown that bactericidal copper touch surfaces made with CuVerro® kill more than 99.9% of bacteria within two hours. We believe that Olin Brass’s copper-based CuVerro® materials are in compliance, in all material respects, with EPA standards for products recognized by the EPA as having bactericidal properties.
In connection with these EPA registrations, the CDA is required to implement a “stewardship” plan that is designed to ensure that bactericidal copper-alloys are properly used and marketed. The stewardship requirement reflects the EPA’s concern that the improper marketing of bactericidal copper-alloys could lead users to mistakenly believe that the use of 
9

these products is a simple solution to fight infections. The stewardship efforts are intended to emphasize that all marketing statements are consistent with the approved EPA product label, including the need to state clearly that the alloys are intended as a supplement to, but are not a substitute for, standard cleaning and sanitization procedures. These standards also apply to marketing by our customers who use CuVerro® in their products.
Even though the marketing of copper products as bactericidal started in 2008, the manufacturers of such products are still in the process of determining what specific bactericidal claims may be made in compliance with the EPA’s and Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act’s (“FIFRA”) requirements. Therefore, there remains some uncertainty when determining whether a particular marketing approach is consistent with the EPA registration requirements. Accordingly, it is possible that we or other manufacturers may be found to be non-compliant by the EPA for current, past or future marketing claims and activities. The EPA can impose administrative, criminal or judicial sanctions and penalties against those violating federal registrations. Any failure by us or our customers who use CuVerro® in their products to comply with FIFRA’s requirements with respect to CuVerro® could therefore expose us to various enforcement actions or other claims or adverse impacts to our reputation. The stewardship program required under the EPA registration is an industry-wide activity, and the actions of other CDA members could jeopardize the marketing of all bactericidal copper products registered through the CDA (including CuVerro®). If the EPA were to determine that the stewardship program is not being implemented effectively, the EPA may initiate a variety of corrective actions, which could adversely affect us and other CDA members, including cancelling all CDA registrations. If the EPA were to initiate an enforcement action that affects us or our customers, it may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market CuVerro® as a bactericidal product.
Lead-free and Low-lead Plumbing Products
New regulations designed to reduce lead content in drinking water plumbing devices provide an opportunity for future growth. Chase Brass is a premier provider of specialized lead-free products and low-lead alloys. Federal legislation in the United States (the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act, which was patterned after legislation enacted in California and Vermont) required the reduction of lead content in all drinking water plumbing devices beginning in January 2014. This legislation presents a significant growth opportunity for Chase Brass. Our Eco Brass® products meet federal, California and Vermont standards and can be used to produce cast, machined and forged faucet parts. We currently supply major faucet, valve and fitting manufacturers who produce multiple products using machined Eco Brass® parts.
Environmental
Our operations are subject to a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and to workplace health and safety. In particular, our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the creation, transportation, use, release and disposal of wastes, air and water emissions, the storage and handling of hazardous substances, environmental protection, remediation, workplace exposure and other matters. Hazardous materials used in our operations include general commercial lubricants, cleaning solvents and cutting oils. Among the regulated activities that occur at some of our facilities are: the accumulation of scrap metal; and the generation of hazardous waste, solid wastes and wastewaters, such as water from burning tables operated at some of our facilities. The generation, storage, and disposal of these wastes are done in accordance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and we use third-party commercial disposal services as permitted by these laws for the removal and disposal of these wastes. The storage, handling and use of lubricating and cutting oils and small quantities of maintenance-related products and chemicals are also regulated under environmental laws, and the health hazards of these materials are communicated to employees pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
In general, our facilities’ operations do not involve the types of emissions of air pollutants, discharges of pollutants to land or surface water, or treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste which would ordinarily require federal or state environmental permits. Some of our facilities possess authorizations under the Clean Air Act for air emissions from paints and coatings. At some locations, we also possess hazardous materials storage permits under local fire codes or ordinances for the storage of combustible materials such as oils or paints. At some facilities we possess state or local permits for on-site septic systems. Our cost of obtaining and complying with such permits has not been, and is not anticipated to be, material.
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental and workplace health and safety laws and do not currently anticipate that we will be required to expend any substantial amounts in the foreseeable future in order to meet such requirements. We have a number of properties located in or near heavy industrial or light industrial use areas; accordingly, these properties may have been contaminated by pollutants which may have migrated from neighboring facilities or have been released by prior occupants for which we may become liable under various laws and regulations. Some of our properties have been affected by releases of cutting oils and similar materials and we are investigating and 
10

remediating such known contamination pursuant to applicable environmental laws. The costs of these clean-ups have not been material in the past. We are not currently subject to any material claims or notices with respect to clean-up or remediation under CERCLA or similar laws for contamination at our leased or owned properties or at any off-site location. However, we could be notified of such claims in the future. It is also possible that we could be identified by the EPA, a state agency, or one or more third parties as a potentially responsible party under federal or state laws and regulations.
Pursuant to the agreement, dated November 19, 2007, by which we purchased our current operating locations from Olin Corporation, Olin Corporation agreed to retain responsibility for a wide range of liabilities under environmental laws arising out of existing contamination on our properties, and agreed to indemnify us without limitation with respect to these liabilities. Specifically, Olin Corporation retained responsibility for:


• | compliance with all obligations to perform investigations and remedial action required under the Connecticut Real Property Transfer Act at properties in Connecticut;


• | pending corrective action / compliance obligations under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act for certain areas of concern at our East Alton, Illinois facility; and


• | all obligations under environmental laws arising out of 24 additional specifically identified areas of concern on various of our properties.

Olin Corporation also retained complete responsibility for all liabilities arising out of then pending governmental inquiries relating to environmental matters; for “any liability or obligation in connection with a facility of the Business to the extent related to pre-Closing human exposure to Hazardous Materials, including asbestos-containing materials”; and for “any liability or obligation in connection with the off-site transportation or disposal of Hazardous Materials arising out of any pre-Closing operations of the Business.”
Since 2007, Olin Corporation has continued to perform environmental remedial actions on our properties, including the East Alton, Illinois and Waterbury, Connecticut properties, and continues to work closely with us to address matters covered by the indemnity. Because of the Olin Corporation indemnity, we have not been required to engage in any significant environmental cleanup activity on our properties and do not currently have any material reserves established to address environmental remedial requirements.
Employees
The following table shows the composition of our workforce by operating segment and Corporate as of December 31, 2016.

 | Employees | % of Total
Olin Brass | 1,222 | | 66 | %
A.J. Oster | 294 | | 16 | %
Chase Brass | 319 | | 17 | %
Corporate | 22 | | 1 | %
Total | 1,857 | | 100 | %

As of December 31, 2016, 1,130, or approximately 61%, of our employees at various sites were members of unions. We have generally maintained good relationships with all unions and employees, which has been an important aspect of our ability to be competitive in our industry. Generally, our various agreements with unions in the United States have contractual terms which range from 1 to 5 years.
Historically, we have succeeded in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements without a strike and we have not experienced any work stoppages at any of our facilities. In particular, our union agreements governing a substantial portion of our employees at Chase Brass and Olin Brass expire in 2017. We believe we will continue to be able to renew the outstanding collective bargaining agreements upon acceptable terms. 
Research and Development
Our staff of scientists in metallurgy and electrochemistry intends to continue to invest in research and development to develop new products and expand our value-added services to meet our customers’ needs.
Our research and development expenditures were not material during 2016, 2015 or 2014.
11

Risk Management and Insurance
The primary risks in our operations are personal injury, property damage, transportation, criminal acts, risks associated with international operations, directors’ and officers’ liability and general commercial liabilities. We are insured against general commercial liabilities (including business interruption), workers’ compensation liabilities, automobile accidents (including injury to employees and physical damage of goods and property and employer liabilities), directors’ and officers’ liability, crime, foreign risks, environmental liability, ocean cargo liability and flood through insurance policies provided by various insurance companies up to amounts we consider sufficient to protect against losses due to claims associated with these risks.
We also maintain bonds with certain federal, state and international authorities to insure against risks relating to, among other things, delays due to customs clearances, compliance with certain laws and regulations and import and export of goods.
Safety
Consistent with other strategic initiatives, we strive to achieve a ‘Best in Class’ performance status for employee safety. A number of our locations participate in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) sponsored Voluntary Protection Program, or VPP. The Safety Excellence / VPP initiative shifts the safety paradigm to an aggressive proactive approach that stresses strong employee participation and collaboration, management accountability, employee training and hazard elimination as core foundational elements. In 2016, our A.J. Oster facility in Yorba Linda, California was recognized as a VPP Star site. This recognition reflects the facility’s achievement in the development, implementation and continuous improvement of their safety and health management system resulting in injury and illness rates that are below the national averages for the industry.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property Rights
Chase Brass has exclusive intellectual property licenses, the longest of which extends to 2027, to produce and sell Eco Brass® rod and ingot in North America, granted by Mitsubishi Shindoh Company, Ltd., the Japanese company that owns the relevant intellectual property rights. The most popular versions of Eco Brass® are protected through May 2019. We have sublicensed our rights to three sublicensees, none of which is currently a competitor of any of our subsidiaries or segments. These sublicensing arrangements are valid until the expiration of the relevant patents in North America. 
We have alloy licensing arrangements with companies in Germany, Japan and China.
We own a number of other U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and licenses relating to certain of our products and processes. We actively protect our proprietary rights by the use of trademark, copyright, and patent registrations. Additionally, we license the marks OLIN BRASS and OLIN METALS for metal products from Olin Corporation. These licenses continue unless we breach the license agreement. We also license stylized versions of these marks from Olin Corporation and the license to the stylized version includes an annual termination option by either party.
We license the intellectual property rights related to certain proprietary alloy systems to other major brass mills around the world, including Dowa Metaltech. 
Government Contract
The United States Mint is and has been a significant customer of Olin Brass since 1969. We have a contractual arrangement to supply nickel and brass coinage strip to multiple United States Mint facilities. As has been the case for a long time, we expect to renew this contract when it expires in 2017. However, the United States Mint can terminate our contract in whole or in part when it is in the best interest of the United States Mint to do so and any damages payable to us by the United States Mint for such termination would not include lost profits.
Seasonality
There is a slight decrease in our net sales in the fourth quarter as a result of the decrease in demand due to customer shutdowns for the holidays and year-end maintenance of plants and inventory by customers. We also typically experience slight working capital increases in the first fiscal quarter as our customers build inventory to serve the seasonal building and housing market.
