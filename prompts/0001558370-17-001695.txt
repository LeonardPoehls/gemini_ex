(“AMID”), American Midstream GP, LLC, the general partner of AMID (“AMID GP”), and an indirect and wholly owned subsidiary of AMID (“Merger Sub”).  On March 8, 2017, we were merged with and into Merger Sub (“AMID Merger”), with the Partnership surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMID. 
      At the effective time of the AMID Merger, (i) each common unit and each subordinated unit of the Partnership issued and outstanding, other than common units and subordinated units of the Partnership held by Lonestar, JP Energy Development LP, a Delaware limited partnership, or their respective affiliates (together, the “Affiliated Holders”) was converted into the right to receive 0.5775 of a common unit representing limited partner interests in AMID (“AMID Common Unit”) and (ii) each common unit and subordinated unit of the Partnership issued and outstanding held by the Affiliated Holders was converted into the right to receive 0.5225 of an AMID Common Unit. 
      In connection with the LP Merger Agreement, on October 23, 2016, AMID GP entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “GP Merger Agreement” and, together with the LP Merger Agreement, the “Merger Agreements”) with JP Energy GP II LLC and a wholly owned subsidiary of AMID GP (“GP Merger Sub”). On March 8, 2017, GP Merger Sub merged with and into JP Energy GP II LLC (the “GP Merger” together with the LP Merger, the “Mergers”), with JP Energy GP II LLC surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMID GP.  
     In connection with the Merger Agreements, Lonestar, the Partnership and JP Energy GP II LLC entered into an Expense Reimbursement Agreement  providing that Lonestar will reimburse, or will pay directly on behalf of, the Partnership or our general partner the third party reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Partnership or our general partner in connection with the Mergers, including all reasonable out-of-pocket legal and financial advisory fees, costs and expenses paid or payable to third parties and incurred in connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of the LP Merger Agreement and consummation of the Mergers.
     How We Conduct Our Business
     We conduct our business through fee-based and margin-based arrangements.
     Fee-based. We charge our customers a capacity, throughput or volume-based fee that is not contingent on commodity price changes. Our fee-based services include the operations in our crude oil pipelines and storage segment, our refined products terminals and storage segment, and the NGL transportation services we provide within our NGL distribution and sales segment. In our crude oil pipelines business, we purchase crude oil at an index price less a transportation fee, and simultaneously sell an identical volume of crude oil at a designated delivery point at the same index price. We consider this a fee-based business because we lock in the economic equivalent of a transportation fee. Our fee-based businesses are governed by tariffs or other negotiated fee agreements between us and our customers with terms ranging from one month to eight years.

 Margin-based. We purchase and sell crude oil in our crude oil pipelines and storage segment, and NGLs and refined products in our NGL distribution and sales segment. A portion of our margin related to the purchase and sale of crude oil in our crude oil pipelines and storage segment is derived from “fee equivalent” transactions in which we concurrently purchase and sell crude oil at prices that are based on an index, thereby generating revenue consisting of a margin plus our purchase, transportation, handling and storage costs. In our NGL distribution and sales segment, sales prices to our customers generally provide for a margin plus the cost of our products to our customers. We manage commodity price exposure through the structure of our sales and supply contracts and through a managed hedging program. Our risk management policy permits the use of financial instruments to reduce the exposure to changes in commodity prices that occur in the normal course of business, but prohibits the use of financial instruments for trading or to speculate on future changes in commodity prices.
     Our Assets and Operations
     Crude Oil Pipelines and Storage
     Silver Dollar Pipeline System. The Silver Dollar Pipeline System provides crude oil gathering services for producers targeting the Spraberry and Wolfcamp formations in the Midland Basin. The system currently consists of approximately 161 miles of high-pressure steel pipeline with throughput capacity of approximately 130,000 barrels per day and three interconnections to third-party, long-haul, transportation pipelines. Our operations are underpinned by long-term, fee-based contracts with leading producers in the Midland Basin. One significant contract has a remaining term of approximately six years and contains an acreage dedication related to crude oil production from approximately 125,000 acres in Crockett and Schleicher counties, Texas. Another significant contract has a remaining term of approximately 2.5 years and contains a minimum volume commitment that was amended in June 2016 to significantly increase the volumes committed thereunder. A third significant contract has a remaining term of approximately eight years and contains an acreage dedication related to crude oil production from approximately 57,000 acres in Reagan, Glasscock, Sterling and Irion Counties.
     The Silver Dollar Pipeline System serves production from the Spraberry and Wolfcamp formations in the Midland Basin within Crockett, Reagan, Glasscock, Sterling, Irion and Schleicher Counties, Texas. As of December 2016, the Silver Dollar Pipeline System is connected to producers that control approximately 360,000 acres in Crockett, Reagan, Glasscock, Sterling, Irion and Schleicher Counties, Texas. The table below contains operational information related to the Silver Dollar Pipeline System.
    
 | | | Throughput For The Three
 | | | Months Ended 
Length | Capacity | Storage Capacity | December 31, 2016 | December 31, 2015
161 miles | 130,000bpd | 140,000 barrels | 30,932bpd | 26,888bpd 

      Construction of the Silver Dollar Pipeline System began in October 2012, and it was put into service in April 2013. The pipeline extends from the Midway Station in Crockett County, Texas to the Owens Station in Reagan County, Texas, a 4.3-acre site with an interconnection to Plains All American Pipeline, L.P.’s Spraberry pipeline expansion. In November 2014, a second connection was made to Oxy Centurion’s Cline Shale pipeline to give Silver Dollar a second delivery location. The Midway Station receives trucking volumes from multiple producers located to the south and has connections to neighboring producer facilities. The Midway Station currently has a 10,000 barrel tank and six truck injection stations. 
     In February 2015, we commissioned a new 70,000 barrel crude oil storage tank which increased our total crude oil storage capacity on the Silver Dollar Pipeline to 110,000 barrels at that time. 
      In April 2015, we announced that we had executed an interconnection agreement with an affiliate of Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (“Magellan”) to connect our Silver Dollar Pipeline System to Magellan’s Longhorn pipeline at the Barnhart Terminal in Crockett County, Texas. The interconnection provides producers with a third takeaway option from the Silver Dollar Pipeline System. The connection was completed and began service in September 2015. As part of the Magellan project, we also added 30,000 barrels of crude oil storage which further increased the total crude oil storage capacity on the Silver Dollar Pipeline to 140,000 barrels.

     In our crude oil pipelines business, we purchase crude oil from a producer or supplier at a designated receipt point on our Silver Dollar Pipeline System at an index price less a transportation fee, and simultaneously sell an identical volume of crude oil at a designated delivery point at the same index price, allowing us to lock in a fixed margin that is in effect economically equivalent to a transportation fee. These transactions account for substantially all of the Adjusted EBITDA we generate on our Silver Dollar Pipeline System.
     Crude Oil Storage. We own a crude oil storage facility in Cushing, Oklahoma with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 3.0 million barrels, consisting of five 600,000-barrel storage tanks. These storage tanks were built in 2009 and are located on the western side of a terminal owned by Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (the “Enterprise Terminal”). The storage tanks are able to receive approximately 18,000 barrels of crude oil per hour or deliver approximately 8,000 barrels of crude oil per hour, and have inbound connections with multiple pipelines and two-way interconnections with all of the other major storage facilities in Cushing, including the delivery point specified in all crude oil futures contracts traded on the NYMEX. TEPPCO Partners LP (“TEPPCO”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Enterprise, serves as the operator of our facilities.
     Our crude oil storage business provides stable and predictable fee-based cash flows. All of the shell capacity of our storage tanks is dedicated to one customer pursuant to a long-term contract, backed by an escrow account, with an expiration in August 2017. We generate crude oil storage revenues by charging this customer a fixed monthly fee per barrel of shell capacity that is not contingent on the customer’s actual usage of our storage tanks.
     Our storage facility is on land that is subject to a 50-year lease with TEPPCO. We have the option to extend our lease by up to an additional 30 years. Our location in the Enterprise Terminal provides our customer with access to multiple pipelines outbound from Cushing, including a manifold connecting our tanks to the Enterprise Terminal. The Enterprise Terminal is connected to the Seaway Pipeline, which is owned and operated by Enterprise and Enbridge Inc. and transports crude oil from Cushing to the Gulf Coast.
     We are party to an operating agreement pursuant to which an affiliate of TEPPCO operates and maintains the crude oil storage tanks located at our crude oil storage facility and provides us with certain services, including services related to product movements, data tracking, station operations (including documentation and inspection programs), and purchases of material. These services are provided to us at a monthly base rate and we are permitted to request additional 

 
  5

 
services from TEPPCO, which are provided to us at cost. TEPPCO is obligated to perform the services as a reasonably prudent operator and in accordance with all applicable laws and accepted industry practices. The operating agreement contains certain other customary terms, including provisions relating to restrictions on assignment, terms of payment, indemnification, confidentiality and dispute resolution. The operating agreement remains in place for the same term as the lease agreement described above.
     Crude Oil Supply and Logistics.  Our crude oil pipelines and storage segment also manages the physical movement of crude oil from origination to final destination largely through our network of owned and leased assets. Our assets and operations are located in areas of substantial future crude oil production growth, including the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford shale, and the Texas Panhandle. We own and operate a fleet of approximately 63 crude oil gathering and transportation trucks and approximately four crude oil truck injection stations and terminals. Due to the limited pipeline infrastructure in some of the basins in which we operate, our crude oil gathering and transportation trucks provide immediate access for customers to transport their crude oil to the most advantageous outlets, including pipelines, rail terminals and local refining centers.
     We primarily generate revenues in our crude oil supply and logistics business by purchasing crude oil from producers, aggregators and traders at an index price less a discount and selling crude oil to producers, traders and refiners at a price linked to the same index. The majority of activities that are carried out within our crude oil supply and logistics business are designed to produce a stable baseline of results in a variety of market conditions, while at the same time providing upside opportunities. 
     In general, sales prices referenced in the underlying contracts, most of which have a 30-day evergreen term, are market-based and may include pricing differentials for such factors as delivery location or crude oil quality. Our crude oil supply and logistics business generates substantial revenues and cost of products sold as a result of the significant volume of crude oil bought and sold. While the absolute price levels of crude oil significantly impact revenues and cost of products sold, such price levels normally do not bear a relationship to gross profit for crude oil sales generated under buy/sell contracts. As a result, period-to-period variations in revenues and cost of products sold are not generally meaningful in analyzing the variation in gross profit for our crude oil supply business.
     We mitigate the commodity price exposure of our crude oil supply and logistics business by limiting our net open positions through the concurrent purchase and sale of like quantities of crude oil intended to lock in positive margins based on the timing, location or quality of the crude oil purchased and delivered. All of our supply activities are subject to our comprehensive risk management policy, which establishes limits in order to manage risk and mitigate our commodity price exposure.
     We are focused on increasing the utilization of our crude oil gathering and transportation fleet. We typically assign crude oil gathering and transportation trucks to a specific area but can temporarily relocate them to meet demand as needed.
     CAST. We equip our drivers with advanced computer technology and dispatch them from central locations. Our drivers are provided with hand-held computers which allow them to utilize our CAST software after they have loaded product. Our CAST software is a centralized system for dispatch, electronic ticket management, reporting, operations data management and lease data management. The CAST software validates ticket data in the field to greatly improve accuracy relative to paper tickets and provides our customers with near real-time views of dispatch, truck tickets, vehicle location, load acceptances and rejections and drivers. The CAST software also offers our customers flexible reporting options by providing customized data to the customer in the format that works best for its accounting and marketing needs.
     Refined Products Terminals and Storage
     Our refined products terminals and storage segment is comprised of two refined products terminals located in North Little Rock, Arkansas and Caddo Mills, Texas. Our refined products terminals are facilities where refined products

are transferred to or from storage or transportation systems, such as pipelines, to other transportation systems, such as trucks. Our refined products terminals provide the following services:
    
· | receipt, storage, inventory management and distribution;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | blending and injection of additives to achieve specified grades of gasoline; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | other ancillary services that include heating of bio-diesel, product transfer and railcar handling services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our refined products terminals consist of multiple storage tanks with a combined aggregate storage capacity of 1.3 million barrels and are equipped with automated truck loading equipment that is operational 24 hours per day. This automated system provides for control of security, allocations, and credit and carrier certification by remote input of data by the terminal and our customers. In addition, our refined products terminals are equipped with truck loading racks capable of providing automated computer blending to individual customer specifications.
     We generate fee-based revenues in our refined products terminals and storage segment from:
    
· | throughput fees based on the receipt and redelivery of refined products, including fees based on the volume of product redelivered from the terminal;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | storage fees based on a rate per barrel of storage capacity per month;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | additive service fees based on ethanol and biodiesel used in blending services and for additive injection; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ancillary fees for the heating of bio-diesel, product transfer and railcar handling services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our refined products terminals and storage segment generates its fee-based revenues pursuant to contracts that typically contain evergreen provisions consistent with industry practice so that, after an initial term of one to two years, they can be canceled upon 60 days’ notice. We also generate revenues from (i) blending activities, such as ethanol blending and butane blending, and (ii) our vapor recovery units. 
     The following table highlights the storage capacity, number of loading lanes, number of tanks, supply source, mode of distribution and average daily throughput of our refined products terminals:
        
 | Shell | | | | | 
 | Storage | | | | | Approximate Average Throughput 
 | Capacity | Loading | Number | | Mode of | (barrels per day) for the Year Ended
Terminal Location | (bbls) | Lanes | of Tanks | Supply Source | Redelivery | December 31, 2016 | December 31, 2015
Little Rock, AR | 550,000 | 8 | 11 | Pipeline, Rail and Truck | Truck | 35,485 | 41,018 
Caddo Mills, TX | 770,000 | 5 | 10 | Pipeline and Truck | Truck | 21,256 | 21,057 

      North Little Rock terminal. Our North Little Rock terminal consists of 11 storage tanks with an aggregate capacity of approximately 550,000 barrels and has eight loading lanes with automated truck loading equipment to minimize wait time for our customers. Our truck loading racks are capable of providing automated computer blending to customer specifications. The North Little Rock terminal handles products such as multi-octane conventional gasoline, ultra-low sulphur diesel with dye-at-rack capability, bio-diesel with ratio blending capability and ethanol. In the second quarter of 2016, we completed the connection of the North Little Rock terminal to Magellan’s Little Rock Pipeline. Following the connection, the North Little Rock terminal allows delivery from Enterprise TE Products Pipeline Company LLC and Magellan’s Little Rock Pipeline which provides access to both Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent refineries. We also completed our ethanol unit train expansion project in the fourth quarter of 2016. With the ethanol

unit train expansion, our North Little Rock terminal’s ethanol offloading efficiency and capacity significantly improved, allowing for offloading of up to 108 car unit trains. Our North Little Rock terminal serves the Little Rock metropolitan area.
     Caddo Mills terminal. Our Caddo Mills terminal consists of 10 storage tanks with an aggregate capacity of approximately 770,000 barrels and has five loading lanes with automated truck loading equipment to minimize wait time for our customers. This terminal is served by the Explorer Pipeline and has truck loading racks capable of providing automated computer blending to customer specifications. Our Caddo Mills terminal handles products such as conventional blend stock for oxygenate blending (CBOB) gasoline, reformulated blend stock for oxygenate blending (RBOB), premium blend stock for oxygenate blending (PBOB), ethanol, ultra-low sulphur diesel with dye-at-rack capability and bio-diesel with ratio blending capability. We own approximately six additional acres of land at our Caddo Mills terminal that is available for future expansion. Management estimates that this acreage is capable of housing an additional 200,000 barrels of storage capacity. The Caddo Mills terminal serves Collin County, located in the northeast portion of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex (“DFW”).  In the first quarter of 2017, we began a capital project to connect to Explorer’s pipeline serving DFW, which will enable our customers to send gasoline and diesel volumes to DFW.
     NGL Distribution and Sales
     NGL Sales
     Our NGL sales business involves the retail, commercial and wholesale sale of NGLs and other refined products (including sales of gasoline and diesel to our oilfield service and agricultural customers) in seven states in the Southwest and Midwest to approximately 102,000 customers through our distribution network of 43 customer service locations. We generate revenues by charging a price per gallon consisting of our product supply, transportation, handling, and storage costs plus a margin. Since July 2010, we have acquired 18 propane franchises to expand our market presence within our operating region in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas and Missouri.
     Customers. We sell propane, butane and refined fuels, including diesel, gasoline, lubricants and solvents, primarily to three customer markets: retail, commercial and wholesale, which include a mix of residential, commercial, agricultural, oilfield service and industrial customers. The customer service centers in our NGL sales business are located in suburban and rural areas where natural gas is not readily available. These customer service centers generally consist of an office, warehouse and service facilities, with one or more 2,500 to 45,000 gallon storage tanks on the premises. These tanks are used to supply our bobtail trucks, which in turn make deliveries to our retail customers. Customers can also bring their own NGL storage containers to our customer service centers to be filled.
     Retail. We primarily serve residential customers through the sale of propane for home heating and power generation. We deliver propane through our 133 active bobtail trucks, which have capacities ranging from 2,000 gallons to 5,000 gallons of propane into stationary storage tanks on our customers’ premises. Tank ownership and control at customer locations are important components of our operations and customer retention, and account for approximately half of our retail volumes. The capacity of these storage tanks ranges from approximately 100 gallons to approximately 12,000 gallons, with a typical tank having a capacity of 250 to 500 gallons. We also offer a propane supply commitment program to customers who own their own tanks. Under the program, customers receive progressively larger discounts off our posted prices each year that they remain as our customer. We also offer our customers a budget payment plan whereby the customer’s estimated annual propane purchases and service contracts are paid for in a series of estimated equal monthly payments over a twelve-month period.
     In Arizona, our subsidiary, Alliant Arizona Propane, L.L.C., sells propane to residential and commercial customers through regulated central distribution systems in two communities, Payson and Page, which utilize pipelines to distribute propane through meters at the customer’s location. Alliant Arizona Propane, L.L.C. is a regulated utility that receives a fixed cost-plus fee for propane sold. Another subsidiary, Alliant Gas L.L.C., serves 28 communities in Texas through regulated central distribution systems pursuant to long-term contracts.
     Commercial. Our commercial customers include a mix of industrial customers, hotels, restaurants, churches, warehouses and retail stores. These customers generally use propane for the same purposes as our residential customers 

 
  8

 
as well as industrial, oilfield service and agricultural customers, who use propane and refined fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, for heating requirements and as fuel to power over-the-road vehicles, forklifts and stationary engines.
     Wholesale. Our wholesale customers are principally governmental agencies and other propane distributors. Our LPG transports, which are large trucks that have capacities ranging from 9,000 to 11,500 gallons, load propane at third-party supply points for delivery directly to tanks located on the property of our wholesale customers.
     Product supply. We utilize approximately 20 domestic sources of propane supply, including spot market purchases, with four suppliers providing a substantial portion of our propane. Our propane supply contracts are typically standard agreements with one-year terms and standard commercial provisions.
     Our supply group manages and sources propane to ensure secure and reliable supply throughout the year. Our LPG transports pick up propane at our supply points, typically refineries, natural gas processing and fractionation plants or LPG storage terminals, for delivery to our customer service centers and our wholesale customers. Supplies of propane from our sources historically have been readily available. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately 91% and 88%, respectively, of our propane supply was purchased under supply agreements, which typically have a term of one year, and the remainder was purchased on the spot market.
     Our supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon (i) index formulas using the current prices established at a major storage point such as Mont Belvieu, Texas, or Conway, Kansas or (ii) posted prices at the time of delivery. We use a variety of delivery methods, including our LPG transports and common carrier transports, to transport propane from suppliers to our customer service locations as well as various third-party storage facilities and terminals located in strategic areas across our area of operations. In order to manage our cost of propane, we enter into hedging arrangements on substantially all fixed-price contracts.
     Cylinder Exchange
     We currently operate the third-largest propane cylinder exchange business in the United States, which consists of the distribution of propane-filled cylinder tanks typically used in barbeque grilling and which covers 46 states in the continental United States through a network of approximately 20,000 distribution locations. We market our business under the brand name Pinnacle Propane Express or under the brand names of our customers. Our customers include grocery stores, pharmacies, convenience stores and hardware retailers which sell or exchange our propane-filled cylinders to consumers for end-use. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold or exchanged approximately 4.8 million propane cylinders containing approximately 17.0 million aggregate gallons of propane. 
     We generate revenues in our cylinder exchange business through the sale or exchange of propane-filled cylinders at an agreed upon contract price. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we distributed 50% and 49%, respectively, of our propane volumes in our cylinder exchange business under long-term agreements and the remaining 50% and 51%, respectively, under one-month contracts or on a spot/demand basis. Our long-term cylinder exchange agreements typically permit us to adjust our prices at the time of contract renewal while our month-to-month cylinder exchange agreements allow us to pass our costs on to our customers and thereby minimize our commodity price exposure. In order to manage our cost of propane, we enter into hedging arrangements on a majority of fixed-price sales contracts.
     Cylinder production cycle. We own eight production facilities strategically located in Alabama, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Oregon, South Carolina and Texas. Our production facilities receive inbound pallets of empty 20-pound propane cylinders, which are put through a processing cycle that includes cleaning, inspection, testing, painting, refilling and loading onto relay trucks for delivery to our 51 distribution depot locations. Drivers at our depots receive the full cylinders from our production facilities for delivery to our customer service locations and pick up empty cylinders, which are shipped to our production facilities for processing.

     NGL Transportation
     We own and operate a fleet of approximately 34 hard shell tank trucks that gather and transport NGLs and condensate for producers, gas processing plants, refiners and fractionators located in the Eagle Ford shale and Permian Basin. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our NGL transportation trucks transported approximately 270,626 gallons per day and 344,763 gallons per day, respectively, of NGLs.
     Competition
     Crude oil pipelines and storage. We are subject to competition from other crude oil pipelines, crude oil storage tank operators and crude oil marketing companies that may be able to transport or store crude oil at more favorable prices or transport crude oil greater distance or to more favorable markets. Additionally, we are subject to competition from other providers of crude oil supply and logistics services that may be able to supply our customers with the same or comparable services on a more competitive basis. We compete with national, regional and local crude oil pipeline, transportation, gathering and storage companies, including the major integrated oil companies, of widely varying sizes, financial resources and experience. Our competitors in our crude oil pipelines and storage segment include Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P., Enterprise Products Partners L.P., Medallion Midstream LLC, NGL Energy Partners L.P., Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Plains All American Pipeline, L.P., SemGroup Corporation, and Sunoco Logistics.
     Refined products terminals and storage. Our refined products terminals located in North Little Rock, Arkansas and Caddo Mills, Texas compete with other terminals on price, versatility and services provided. The competition primarily comes from integrated petroleum companies, refining and marketing companies, independent terminal companies and distribution companies with marketing and trading activities. In the North Little Rock, Arkansas market, these competitors include Magellan Midstream Partners LP, Delek Logistics Partners LP and HWRT Oil Company, LLC. In Dallas, Texas, the market served by our Caddo Mills, Texas terminal, these competitors include Valero Energy Corporation, Delek Logistics Partners, LP, Magellan Midstream Partners LP and Flint Hills Resources LP.
     NGL distribution and sales. In addition to competing with suppliers of other energy sources such as natural gas, our NGL distribution and sales segment competes with other retail propane distributors. The retail propane industry is highly fragmented and competition generally occurs on a local basis with other large full-service multi-state propane marketers, thousands of smaller local independent marketers and farm cooperatives. The large, full-service multi-state marketers we compete with include Ferrellgas, L.P. and AmeriGas Partners, L.P. Each of our customer service centers operates in its own competitive environment because retail marketers tend to be located in close proximity to customers in order to lower the cost of providing service. Our typical customer service center has an effective marketing radius of approximately 50 miles, although in certain areas the marketing radius may be extended by one or more satellite offices. Most of our customer service centers compete with five or more marketers or distributors.
     Customers
     We rely on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues. Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc., Plains Marketing LP., and BP Products North America each accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, at approximately 25%, 15%, and 11%, respectively.     Seasonality
     Weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products, particularly propane and refined fuels for heating purposes. Many of our customers rely on propane primarily as a heating source. Accordingly, the volumes sold are directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in our service areas, which can vary substantially from year to year. In any given area, sustained warmer than normal temperatures, as was the case in the heating season over the last three years throughout our operating territories, will tend to result in reduced propane, fuel oil and natural gas consumption, while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater consumption. Meanwhile, our cylinder exchange operations experience higher volumes in the spring and summer, which includes the majority of the grilling season. Sustained periods of poor weather, particularly in the grilling season, can negatively 

 
  10

 
affect our cylinder exchange revenues. In addition, poor weather may reduce consumers’ propensity to purchase and use grills and other propane-fueled appliances, thereby reducing demand for cylinder exchange.
     The volume of propane used by customers of our NGL sales business is higher during the first and fourth calendar quarters and lower during the second and third calendar quarters. Conversely, the volume of propane that we sell through our cylinder exchange business is higher during the second and third calendar quarters and lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters. We believe that our combination of our winter-weighted NGL sales business with our higher-margin, summer-weighted cylinder exchange business reduces overall seasonal fluctuations in volumes and financial results, as our cylinder exchange business is more active in summer months and our NGL sales business is more active in winter months. The impact of seasonality is also mitigated by non-heating related demand throughout the year for propane for oilfield services, fuel for automobiles and for industrial applications, such as forklifts, mowers and generators. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold approximately 58.8 million gallons of NGLs in our cylinder exchange and NGL sales businesses, selling approximately 41% in the second and third quarters of 2016 and 59% in the first and fourth quarters of 2016.
     The volume of product that is handled, transported, throughput or stored in our refined products terminals is directly affected by the level of supply and demand in the wholesale markets served by our terminals. Overall supply of refined products in the wholesale markets is influenced by the absolute prices of the products, the availability of capacity on delivering pipelines and vessels, fluctuating refinery margins and the market’s perception of future product prices. Although demand for gasoline typically peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from April to September, and declines during the fall and winter months, most of the revenues generated at our refined products terminals do not experience any effects from such seasonality. However, the butane blending operations at our refined products terminals are affected by seasonality because of federal regulations governing seasonal gasoline vapor pressure specifications. Accordingly, we expect that the revenues we generate from butane blending will be highest in the winter months and lowest in the summer months.
     Insurance
     Our assets may experience physical damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. We maintain casualty, property, and environmental liability insurance policies at varying levels of deductibles and limits that we believe are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances to cover our operations and assets. As we continue to grow, we will continue to evaluate our policy limits and retentions as they relate to the overall cost and scope of our insurance program.
     Regulation of the Industry and Our Operations
     Crude Oil
     We own and operate a fleet of trucks to transport crude oil. We are licensed to perform both intrastate and interstate motor carrier services and are subject to certain safety regulations issued by the Department of Transportation (“DOT”). DOT regulations cover, among other things, driver operations, maintaining log books, truck manifest preparations, the placement of safety placards on trucks and trailer vehicles, drug and alcohol testing, safety of operation and equipment and many other aspects of our trucking operations. Our trucking operations are also subject to regulations and oversight by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Additionally, our Silver Dollar Pipeline System is subject to the regulatory oversight of the Texas Railroad Commission and the DOT’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), whose pipeline safety regulations are described in the section below.
     Refined Products and NGLs
     All states in which we operate have adopted fire safety codes that regulate the storage and distribution of propane. In some states, these laws are administered by state agencies, and in others they are administered on a municipal level. We maintain various permits necessary to ensure that our operations comply with applicable regulations. We conduct training programs to help ensure that our operations are in compliance with applicable governmental regulations. With respect to general operations, certain National Fire Protection Association (“NFPA”) Pamphlets, including Nos. 54 and 58 and/or one or more of various international codes (including international fire, 

 
  11

 
building and fuel gas codes) establish rules and procedures governing the safe handling of propane, or comparable regulations, which have been adopted by all states in which we operate. In addition, Alliant Arizona Propane, LLC is subject to regulation by the Arizona Corporation Commission and Alliant Gas, LLC is subject to regulation by the Texas Railroad Commission. We believe that the policies and procedures currently in effect at all of our facilities for the handling, storage and distribution of propane are consistent with industry standards and are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental, health and safety laws.
     With respect to the transportation of NGLs, including propane, by truck, we are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act and the Homeland Security Act of 2002, among other statutes. Our propane gas pipeline systems are also subject to regulation by the PHMSA under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, which applies to, among other things, a propane gas system that supplies ten or more residential customers or two or more commercial customers from a single source and to a propane gas system any portion of which is located in a public place. The DOT’s pipeline safety regulations require operators of all gas systems to train employees and third-party contractors, establish written procedures to minimize the hazards resulting from gas pipeline emergencies and conduct and keep records of inspections and testing.
     PHMSA requires pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in high-consequence areas (“HCAs”), defined as those areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage, that cross a navigable waterway, or that have a high population density. The regulations require operators, including us, to (i) perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity, (ii) identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a HCA, (iii) improve data collection, integration and analysis, (iv) repair and remediate pipelines as necessary and (v) implement preventive and mitigating actions. In October 2015, PHMSA proposed changes to its pipeline safety regulations that would significantly extend the integrity management requirements to previously exempted pipelines and would impose additional obligations on pipeline operators that are already subject to the integrity management provisions. PHMSA’s proposed rule would also require annual reporting of safety-related conditions and incident reports for all gathering lines and gravity lines, including pipelines that are currently exempt from PHMSA regulations. PHMSA issued a separate regulatory proposal in July 2015 that would impose further pipeline incident prevention and response measures on pipeline operations. While we expect such regulatory changes to allow us time to become compliant with new requirements, once finalized, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations.
     The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, among other things, increases the maximum civil penalty for pipeline safety violations and directs the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate rules or standards relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation and testing to confirm the material strength of pipe operating above 30% of specified minimum yield strength in high consequence areas. Effective October 25, 2013, PHMSA adopted new rules increasing the maximum administrative civil penalties for violation of the pipeline safety laws and regulations after January 3, 2012 to $200,000 per violation per day, with a maximum of $2,000,000 for a related series of violations. PHMSA also has published an advisory bulletin providing guidance on verification of records related to pipeline maximum operating pressure. We have performed hydrotests of our facilities to confirm the maximum operating pressure and do not expect that any final rulemaking by PHMSA regarding verification of maximum operating pressure would materially affect our operations or revenue.
     States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most states are certified by the DOT to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. States may adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines; however, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. State standards may include requirements for facility design and management in addition to requirements for pipelines.
     Management believes that the policies and procedures currently in effect at all of our propane gas systems are consistent with industry standards and are in compliance with applicable law. Due to our ownership and control of these gas utility companies, we are required to notify FERC of our status as a holding company. We filed such a notification of holding company status and we qualified for an exemption from FERC accounting regulations and access to our books and records because we are a holding company solely by reason of our interests in local gas distribution systems.

     Environmental Matters
     General
     Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. As an owner or operator of certain terminals, storage and transportation facilities, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:
· | requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment or otherwise restricting the way we operate;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | delaying system modification or upgrades during permit reviews;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | enjoining the operations of facilities deemed to be in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to or permit requirements imposed by such environmental laws and regulations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment.
     We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we believe that the various environmental activities in which we are presently engaged are not expected to materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability. We cannot assure you, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs. Below is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business.
     Hazardous Substances and Waste
     Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of solid and hazardous wastes and other substances, including hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
     We also generate industrial wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. We 

 
  13

 
generate little hazardous waste. However, it is possible that wastes currently designated as non-hazardous, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, will in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes” and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Moreover, from time to time, the EPA and state regulatory agencies have considered the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes, including natural gas wastes. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses or otherwise impose limits or restrictions on our operations or those of our customers.
     We currently own or lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although previous operators have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently aware of any facts, events or conditions relating to such requirements that could materially impact our operations or financial condition.
     Oil Pollution Act
     The Oil Pollution Act (“OPA”) requires the preparation of a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan (“SPCC”) for facilities engaged in drilling, producing, gathering, storing, processing, refining, transferring, distributing, using, or consuming oil and oil products, and which due to their location, could reasonably be expected to discharge oil in harmful quantities into or upon the navigable waters of the United States. The owner or operator of an SPCC-regulated facility is required to prepare a written, site-specific spill prevention plan, which details how a facility’s operations comply with the requirements. To be in compliance, the facility’s SPCC plan must satisfy all of the applicable requirements for drainage, bulk storage tanks, tank car and truck loading and unloading, transfer operations (intrafacility piping), inspections and records, security, and training.     Air Emissions
     Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and criminal enforcement actions. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.
     On August 20, 2010, the EPA published regulations to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants from existing stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines, which was later amended in response to several petitions for reconsideration. The rule requires us to make certain expenditures and undertake certain activities, including the purchase and installation of emissions control equipment (e.g. oxidation catalysts, non-selective catalytic reduction equipment) on our engines following prescribed maintenance practices. In addition, on June 28, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule that establishes new source performance standards for manufacturers, owners and operators of new, modified and reconstructed stationary internal combustion engines. This rule requires us to purchase, install, monitor and maintain emissions control equipment.
     Water Discharges
     The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters and impose requirements affecting our ability to conduct construction 

 
  14

 
activities in waters and wetlands. In addition, these laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. These permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
     Endangered Species
     The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. In addition, as a result of a settlement approved by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 9, 2011, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is required to consider listing more than 250 species as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Under the September 9, 2011 settlement, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is required to review and address the needs of more than 250 species on the candidate list over a 6-year period. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we or our oil and propane exploration and production customers operate could cause us or our customers to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures and could result in delays or limitations in our customers’ performance of operations, which could reduce demand for our services.     Hydraulic Fracturing and Flaring
     Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and flaring of natural gas could result in reductions or delays in crude oil, natural gas and NGL production by our customers, which could materially adversely impact our revenues. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into geographic formations to stimulate hydrocarbon production. Although we do not engage in hydraulic fracturing or flaring activities, an increasing percentage of hydrocarbon production by our customers and suppliers is developed from unconventional sources, such as shales, that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process and, due to the lack of natural gas transportation infrastructure in certain areas, sometimes also results in flaring of natural gas produced in association with crude oil production. Hydraulic fracturing and flaring are typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. Some states, including those in which we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent disclosure and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition, a number of federal agencies, including the EPA and the Department of Energy, are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing, and have asserted federal regulatory authority over the process. In December 2016, the EPA released its final report regarding the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances such as water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water, injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources, discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters, and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. The results of these studies could lead federal and state governments and agencies to develop and implement additional regulations. Moreover, Congress from time to time has proposed legislation to more closely and uniformly regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing or flaring are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for our customers to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing or flaring could also reduce the volume of hydrocarbons that our customers produce, and could thereby adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.     Climate Change
     On December 15, 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings allow the EPA to adopt and implement regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”). Accordingly, the EPA adopted construction and operating permit requirements under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs for certain stationary sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted a 

 
  15

 
mandatory GHG emissions reporting program that imposes reporting and monitoring requirements on various types of facilities and industries. In November 2010, the EPA expanded its GHG reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage, and distribution facilities, requiring reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities on an annual basis. In October 2015, the EPA finalized additional amendments to its greenhouse gas reporting rule, which added pre-reporting requirements for additional facilities. And in May 2016, the EPA finalized additional regulations to reduce emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds from the oil and gas sector.
     While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of federal climate legislation in the United States, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. In addition, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an international agreement to address GHG emissions (“Paris Accord”). The Paris Accord entered into force in November 2016 after over 70 countries, including the United States, ratified or otherwise indicated that it intends to comply with the agreement.
     Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would affect our business, any such future laws and regulations could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and gas, which could reduce the demand for crude oil or refined products produced or distributed by our customers, which could in turn reduce revenues we are able to generate by providing services to our customers. Accordingly, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
     Anti-terrorism Measures
     Certain of our bulk storage facilities are also subject to regulation by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). The Department of Homeland Security Appropriation Act of 2007 requires the DHS to issue regulations establishing risk-based performance standards for the security of chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities that are deemed to present “high levels of security risk.” The DHS issued an interim final rule in April 2007 regarding risk-based performance standards to be attained pursuant to this act and, on November 20, 2007, further issued an Appendix A to the interim rules that establish chemicals of interest and their respective threshold quantities that will trigger compliance with these interim rules. Covered facilities that are determined by DHS to pose a high level of security risk will be required to prepare and submit Security Vulnerability Assessments and Site Security Plans as well as comply with other regulatory requirements, including those regarding inspections, audits, recordkeeping, and protection of chemical-terrorism vulnerability information.     Trademarks and Tradenames
     We utilize a variety of trademarks and tradenames which we own or have the right to use, including “JP Energy Partners,” “Pinnacle Propane,” “Pinnacle Propane Express” and “Alliant Arizona Propane.” We regard our trademarks, tradenames and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that they have significant value in the marketing of our products and services.     Employees
     We are managed and operated by the board of directors and executive officers of our general partner. Neither we nor our subsidiaries have any employees. Our general partner has the sole responsibility for providing the employees and other personnel necessary to conduct our operations. As of February 27, 2017, our general partner and its affiliates 

 
  16

 
have approximately 664 employees performing services for our operations. None of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our general partner and its affiliates have a satisfactory relationship with their employees.
     Financial Information about Geographical Areas
     We have no international activities. For all periods included in this report, all of our revenue was derived from operations conducted in, and all of our assets were located in, the U.S. See Note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.         Available Information
     We file or furnish annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any related amendments and supplements thereto with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). You may read and copy any materials we file or furnish with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information regarding the public reference room by calling the SEC at 1-800-732-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.

     JP ENERGY PARTNERS LP AND SUBSIDIARIES
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
     1. Business and Basis of Presentation
     Business. The consolidated financial statements presented herein contain the results of JP Energy Partners LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and its subsidiaries. All expressions of the “Partnership”, “JPE”, “us”, “we”, “our”, and all similar expressions are references to JP Energy Partners LP and our consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context requires otherwise. We were formed in May 2010 by members of management and were further capitalized in June 2011 by ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC (“ArcLight”) to own, operate, develop and acquire a diversified portfolio of midstream energy assets. Our operations currently consist of three business segments: (i) crude oil pipelines and storage, (ii) refined products terminals and storage and (iii) NGL distribution and sales, which together provide midstream infrastructure solutions for the growing supply of crude oil, refined products and NGLs, in the United States. JP Energy GP II LLC (“GP II”) was our general partner with Argo Merger GP Sub, LLC becoming our general partner on March 8, 2017. See “AMID Merger Agreement” below for more details.
     AMID Merger Agreement. On October 23, 2016, we and our general partner entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“LP Merger Agreement”) with American Midstream Partners, L.P. (“AMID”), American Midstream GP, LLC, the general partner of AMID (“AMID GP”), and an indirect and wholly owned subsidiary of AMID (“Merger Sub”). On March 8, 2017, we were merged with and into Merger Sub (“AMID Merger”), with the Partnership surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMID.
      At the effective time of the AMID Merger, (i) each of our common and subordinated units issued and outstanding, other than our common and subordinated units held by Lonestar, JP Energy Development LP, a Delaware limited partnership, or their respective affiliates (together, the “Affiliated Holders”) was converted into 0.5775 of a common unit representing limited partner interests in AMID (“AMID Common Unit”) and (ii) each of our common and subordinated units issued and outstanding held by the Affiliated Holders was converted into 0.5225 of an AMID Common Unit.
      In connection with the LP Merger Agreement, on October 23, 2016, AMID GP entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “GP Merger Agreement” and, together with the LP Merger Agreement, the “Merger Agreements”) with our general partner and a wholly owned subsidiary of AMID GP (“GP Merger Sub”). On March 8, 2017, GP Merger Sub merged with and into GP II (the “GP Merger” together with the LP Merger, the “Mergers”), with GP II surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMID GP. As a result of the GP Merger, Argo Merger GP Sub, LLC was admitted as the sole general partner of JPE and GP II simultaneously ceased to be the general partner of JPE.
     In connection with the Merger Agreements, Lonestar, the Partnership and our general partner entered into an Expense Reimbursement Agreement providing that Lonestar will reimburse, or will pay directly on behalf of, the Partnership or our general partner the third party reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Partnership or our general partner in connection with the Mergers, including all reasonable out-of-pocket legal and financial advisory fees, costs and expenses paid or payable to third parties and incurred in connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of the LP Merger Agreement and consummation of the Mergers. 
      JP Development. On July 12, 2012, ArcLight and the owners of JPE formed JP Energy Development LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“JP Development”), for the express purpose of supporting JPE’s growth. Since its formation, JP Development had acquired a portfolio of midstream assets that were developed for potential future sale to JPE. JPE and JP Development are under common control because a majority of the equity interests in each entity and their general partners are owned by ArcLight. JP Development made the following acquisitions since its formation in July 2012:
     On August 3, 2012, JP Development acquired Parnon Gathering LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parnon Gathering”), which provides midstream gathering and transportation services to 

 
  F-7

 
companies engaged in the production, distribution and marketing of crude oil. Subsequent to the acquisition, Parnon Gathering LLC was renamed to JP Energy Marketing LLC (“JPEM”).
     On July 15, 2013, JP Development acquired substantially all of the retail propane assets of BMH Propane, LLC, an Arkansas limited liability company (“BMH”), which is engaged in the retail and wholesale propane and refined fuel distribution business.
     On August 30, 2013, JP Development, through JPEM, acquired substantially all the operating assets of Alexander Oil Field Services, Inc., a Texas Corporation (“AOFS”), which is engaged in the crude oil trucking business.
     On October 7, 2013, JP Development acquired Wildcat Permian Services LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Wildcat Permian”) that was later merged with and into JP Energy Permian, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“JP Permian”).  JP Permian is engaged in the transportation of crude oil by pipeline.
     On October 10, 2013, JP Liquids, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of JP Development (“JP Liquids”), acquired substantially all of the assets of Highway Pipeline, Inc., a Texas corporation (“Highway Pipeline”), which is engaged in the transportation of natural gas liquids and condensate via hard shell tank trucks.
     As a result of the common control acquisition between JPE and JP Development discussed below and the sale of its GSPP pipeline assets (see Note 3), JP Development does not currently hold any material assets.
     Common Control Acquisition between JPE and JP Development. On February 12, 2014, pursuant to a Membership Interest and Asset Purchase Agreement, we acquired (i) certain marketing and trucking businesses of JPEM (the “Parnon Gathering Assets”), (ii) the assets and liabilities associated with AOFS, (iii) the retail propane assets acquired from BMH and (iv) all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in JP Permian and JP Liquids (collectively, the “Dropdown Assets”) from JP Development for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $319.1 million (the “Common Control Acquisition”), which was comprised of 12,561,934 JPE Class A Common Units and $52.0 million cash. We financed the cash portion of the purchase price through borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
     Basis of Presentation. Because JPE and JP Development are under common control, we are required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) to account for this Common Control Acquisition in a manner similar to the pooling of interest method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, our balance sheet reflected JP Development’s historical carryover net basis in the Dropdown Assets instead of reflecting the fair market value of assets and liabilities of the Dropdown Assets. We also retrospectively recast our financial statements to include the operating results of the Dropdown Assets from the dates these assets were originally acquired by JP Development (the dates upon which common control began).
     The historical assets and liabilities and the operating results of the Dropdown Assets have been “carved out” from JP Development’s consolidated financial statements using JP Development’s historical basis in the assets and liabilities of the businesses and reflects assumptions and allocations made by management to separate the Dropdown Assets on a stand-alone basis. Our recast historical consolidated financial statements include all revenues, costs, expenses, assets and liabilities directly attributable to the Dropdown Assets, as well as allocations that include certain expenses for services, including, but not limited to, general corporate expenses related to finance, legal, information technology, shared services, employee benefits and incentives and insurance. These expenses have been allocated based on the most relevant allocation method to the services provided, primarily on the relative percentage of revenue, relative percentage of headcount, or specific identification.  Management believes the assumptions underlying the combined financial statements are reasonable.  However, the combined financial statements do not fully reflect what our, including the Dropdown Assets’ balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows would have been, had the Dropdown Assets been under our management during the periods presented. As a result, historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of what our balance sheet, results of operations, and cash flows will be in the future.

 
  F-8

 

     JP Development has a centralized cash management that covers all of its subsidiaries.  The net amounts due from/to JP Development by the Dropdown Assets relate to a variety of intercompany transactions including the collection of trade receivables, payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, charges of allocated corporate expenses and payments by JP Development on behalf of the Dropdown Assets. Such amounts have been treated as deemed contributions from/deemed distributions to JP Development for the year ended December 31, 2014.  The total net effect of the deemed contributions is reflected as contribution from the predecessor in the statements of cash flows as a financing activity.  The net balances due to us from the Dropdown Assets were settled in cash based on the outstanding balances at the effective date of Common Control Acquisition.
     The total purchase price from the Common Control Acquisition exceeded JP Development’s book value of the net assets acquired. As a result, the excess of the total purchase price over the book value of the assets acquired of $12.7 million was considered a deemed distribution by the general partner and is included as a reduction in general partner interest in Partners’ Capital.
     The “predecessor capital” included in Partners’ Capital represents JP Development’s net investment in the Dropdown Assets, which included the net income or loss allocated to the Dropdown Assets, and contributions from and distributions to JP Development.  Certain transactions between the Dropdown Assets and other related parties that are wholly-owned subsidiaries of JP Development were not cash settled and, as a result, were considered deemed contributions or distributions and are included in JP Development’s net investment.
     Net income (loss) attributable to the Dropdown Assets prior to our acquisition of such assets was not available for distribution to our unitholders. Therefore, this income (loss) was not allocated to the limited partners for the purpose of calculating net loss per common unit; instead, the income (loss) was allocated to predecessor capital.
     Initial Public Offering. On October 2, 2014, our common units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “JPEP.” On October 7, 2014, we closed our IPO of 13,750,000 common units at a price of $20.00 per unit.  Prior to the closing of the IPO, the following recapitalization trasactions occurred:
     we distributed approximately $92.1 million of accounts receivable that comprised our working capital assets to the existing partners, pro rata in accordance with their ownership interests, of which $72.5 million, $6.0 million and $3.3 million was distributed to Lonestar Midstream Holdings, LLC (“Lonestar”),  Truman Arnold Companies (“TAC”) and JP Development, respectively, all of which are related parties;
     each Class A common unit, Class B common unit and Class C common unit (collectively, the “Existing Common Units”) were split into approximately 0.89 common units, resulting in an aggregate of 22,677,004 outstanding Existing Common Units; and
     an aggregate of 18,213,502 Existing Common Units held by the existing partners were automatically converted into 18,213,502 subordinated units representing a 80.3% interest in us prior to the IPO, and a 50.0% interest in us after the closing of the IPO, with 4,463,502 Existing Common Units remaining representing a 19.7% interest in us (the “Remaining Existing Common Units”).
     Subsequent to the closing of the IPO, the following recapitalization transactions occurred:
     the Remaining Existing Common Units were automatically converted on a one-to-one basis into 4,463,502 common units representing a 12.3% interest in us;
     the 45 general partner units in the Partnership held by the general partner were recharacterized as a non-economic general partner interest in us; and
     we issued 13,750,000 common units to the public representing a 37.7% interest in us.
    
 
  F-9

 

 We used the proceeds from the IPO of approximately $257.1 million, net of underwriting discounts and structuring fees, to:
     pay offering expenses of approximately $2.0 million;
     redeem 100% of our issued and outstanding Series D preferred units for approximately $42.4 million;
     repay $195.6 million of the debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility; and
     replenish $17.1 million of working capital that was distributed to the then existing partners immediately prior to the IPO.
     Immediately following the repayment of the debt outstanding under the our revolving credit facility, we borrowed approximately $75.0 million thereunder in order to replenish the remainder of working capital that was distributed to existing partners immediately prior to the IPO.
     2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
     Principles of Consolidation.  Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
     Use of Estimates.  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
     Cash and Cash Equivalents.  We consider all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts that do not meet the right of offset criteria are recorded in capital leases and short-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets.
     Accounts Receivable.  Accounts receivable are reported net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification and expectation of collecting considering historical collection results. Account balances considered to be uncollectible are recorded to the allowance for doubtful accounts and charged to bad debt expense, which is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1,241,000 and $1,217,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Bad debt expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $408,000, $1,212,000 and $820,000, respectively.
     Inventory.  Inventory is mainly comprised of crude oil, NGLs, refined products for resale, as well as propane cylinders expected to be sold to customers. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost of crude oil, NGLs and refined products inventory is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Cost of propane cylinders is determined using the weighted average method.
     Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets. Prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily relate to prepaid insurance premiums, which totaled $5,394,000 and $1,239,000, and insurance receivables due from overpaid premiums and insurance claims, which totaled $2,156,000 and $115,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
     Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. We did not have any derivatives designated in hedging relationships during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Therefore, the change in the fair value of the derivative asset or liability is reflected in net loss in the consolidated statements of operations (mark-to-market 

 
  F-10

 
accounting). Cash flows from derivatives settled are reported as cash flow from operating activities, in the same category as the cash flows from the items being economically hedged.
     We are also a party to a number of contracts that have elements of a derivative instrument. These contracts are primarily forward propane and crude oil purchase and sales contracts with counterparties. Although many of these contracts have the requisite elements of a derivative instrument, these contracts qualify for normal purchase and normal sales exception (“NPNS”) accounting under GAAP because they provide for the delivery of products or services in quantities that are expected to be used in the normal course of operating our business and the price in the contract is based on an underlying that is directly associated with the price of the product or service being purchased or sold. As a result, these contracts are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements until they are settled.
     Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost of construction, or, upon acquisition, the fair value of the assets acquired. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Any major additions and improvements that materially extend the useful lives of property, plant and equipment are capitalized. At the time assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the account, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized within the consolidated statements of operations.
     We account for asset retirement obligations by recognizing on our balance sheet the net present value of any legally binding obligation to remove or remediate tangible long-lived assets, such as requirements to dispose of equipment. We record a liability for asset retirement obligations when a known obligation exists under current law or contract and when a reasonable estimate of the value of the liability can be made.
     Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:
    
Buildings | 20 | - | 30 | years
Leasehold improvements | | Various* | | 
Transportation equipment | 5 | - | 15 | years
Propane tanks and cylinders | 3 | - | 25 | years
Bulk storage tanks | | | 20 | years
Pipelines | | | 20 | years
Right-of-way | | Various* | | 
Office furniture and fixtures | 5 | - | 10 | years
Other equipment | 3 | - | 31 | years

       *Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the life of the leasehold improvement or the lease term. Right-of-way assets are depreciated over the shorter of the life of the related pipeline or the right-of-way term.
     Leases. We have both capital and operating leases. Classification is made at the inception of the lease. The classification of leases is based on the extent to which risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased asset lie with the lessor or the lessee.
     Leased property meeting certain capital lease criteria is capitalized and the present value of the related lease payments is recorded as a liability. The present value of the minimum lease payments is calculated utilizing the lower of our incremental borrowing rate or the lessor’s interest rate implicit in the lease, if known by us. Depreciation of capitalized leased assets is computed utilizing the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term and is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations. However, if the lease meets the bargain purchase or transfer of ownership criteria, the asset shall be amortized in accordance with our normal depreciation policy for owned assets.
     Minimum rent payments under operating leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including any rent free periods.

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment, and acquired intangible assets subject to depreciation and amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, we first compare undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary (Level 3). For assets held for sale, we compare the fair value of the disposal group to its carrying value. Under the assets held for sale criteria, the order of impairment is based on (i) testing other assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and indefinite-lived intangible assets, for impairment (ii) testing goodwill for impairment and (iii) testing the long-lived asset group for impairment. In connection with the sale of our Mid-Continent Business (defined in Note 3 and classified as held for sale at December 31, 2015), we recorded an impairment charge of $4,970,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 related to long-lived assets, which is classified in net loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations.
     Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We apply Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, "Business Combinations," and ASC 350, "Intangibles—Goodwill and Other," to account for goodwill. In accordance with these standards, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently whenever a triggering event or change in circumstances occurs at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or business one level below the operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether further impairment testing is necessary. Impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. To estimate the fair value of the reporting units, we make estimates and judgments about future cash flows, as well as revenues, cost of sales, operating expenses, capital expenditures and net working capital based on assumptions that are consistent with our most recent forecast. At the time it is determined that an impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the goodwill is written down to its fair value.
     During the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized impairment charges of $12.8 million in our Pinnacle Propane Express reporting unit within our NGL distribution and sales segment due primarily to declines in future estimated margins as a result of increased competition and recent increases in propane prices and $2.7 million in our JP Liquids reporting unit within our NGL distribution and sales segment due primarily to declines in future estimated volumes.
     During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $23,574,000 and $6,322,000 related to the goodwill in our crude oil supply and logistics reporting unit within our crude oil pipelines and storage segment and JP Liquids reporting unit within our NGL distribution and sales segment, respectively, primarily due to the substantial decline in commodity prices in 2015 and the resulting decline in margin as well as volume in those reporting units.  We also recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of $7,939,000 triggered by the disposition of our Mid-Continent Business. The $7,939,000 of goodwill was allocated to the Mid-Continent Business based on the relative fair value of the Mid-Continent Business and the portion of the reporting unit that was retained by us. No provision for impairment of goodwill was recorded during 2014.        During the second quarter of 2014, immediately prior to the sale of the Bakken Business (defined in Note 3) within the crude oil supply and logistics reporting unit, we allocated $1,984,000 of goodwill to the Bakken Business, which was based on the relative fair value of the disposed Bakken Business and the portion of the reporting unit that was retained by us. The $1,984,000 allocation contributed to the overall net loss from discontinued operations.
     Business Combinations.  When a business is acquired, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component using various valuation techniques, including the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach. The accounting standard for business combinations requires most identifiable assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired to be recorded at fair value. Transaction costs related to the acquisition of the business are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with the issuance of debt associated with a business combination are capitalized and included as a yield adjustment to the underlying 

 
  F-12

 
debt’s stated rate. Acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives unless the lives are determined to be indefinite. Contingent consideration obligations are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition, with increases or decreases in the fair value arising from changes in assumptions or discount periods recorded as contingent consideration expenses in the consolidated statement of operations in subsequent periods. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.
     When we acquire a business from an entity under common control, whereby the companies are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the transaction, it is treated similar to the pooling of interest method of accounting. Under a common control acquisition, the assets and liabilities are recorded at the transferring entity’s historical cost instead of reflecting the fair market value of assets and liabilities.
     Deferred Financing Costs. Debt issuance costs related to our revolving credit agreement (see Note 11) are deferred and are recorded net of accumulated amortization in the consolidated balance sheets as deferred financing costs, and totaled $2,029,000 and $2,809,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These costs are amortized over the terms of the related debt using the effective interest rate method for the notes payable and the straight-line method for the revolving credit facilities. As a result of the financing transactions discussed in Note 11, we wrote off $1,634,000 of deferred financing costs associated with the extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2014 which is recorded in loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations. Amortization of deferred financing costs is recorded in interest expense and totaled $969,000, $909,000 and $906,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
     Customer Deposits and Advances. Certain customers are offered a prepayment program which requires a customer to pay a fixed periodic amount or to otherwise prepay a portion of their anticipated product purchases. Customer prepayments in excess of associated billings are classified as customer deposits and advances in the consolidated balance sheets.
     Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and/or services have been rendered, the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
     Revenue-related taxes collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities, principally sales taxes, are presented on a net basis within the consolidated statements of operations.
     Crude Oil Pipelines and Storage. The crude oil pipelines and storage segment mainly generates revenues through crude oil sales and pipeline transportation and storage fees. We enter into outright purchase and sales contracts as well as buy/sell contracts with counterparties, under which contracts we gather and transport different types of crude oil and eventually sell the crude oil to either the same counterparty or different counterparties. We account for such revenue arrangements on a gross basis. Occasionally, we enter into crude oil inventory exchange arrangements with the same counterparty which the purchase and sale of inventory are considered in contemplation of each other. Revenues from such inventory exchange arrangements are recorded on a net basis. Revenues for crude oil pipeline transportation services are recognized upon delivery of the product, and when payment has either been received or collection is reasonably assured. For certain crude oil pipeline transportation arrangements, we enter into sale and purchase contracts with counterparties instead of pipeline transportation agreements. In such cases, we assess the indicators associated with agent and principal considerations for each arrangement to determine whether revenue should be recorded on a gross basis versus net basis. In addition, we also provide crude oil transportation services to third party customers.
     Refined Products Terminals and Storage. We generate fee-based revenues for terminal and storage services with longstanding customers under contracts that, consistent with industry practice, typically contain evergreen provisions after an initial term of one to two years. Such fee-based revenues are recognized when services are proved upon delivery of the products to customers. Revenues are also generated by selling excess refined products that result from blending, additization and inventory control processes.
    
 
  F-13

 

 NGLs Distributions and Sales. Revenues from the NGLs distributions and sales are mainly generated from NGL and refined product sales, sales of the related parts and equipment and through gathering and transportation fees. 
     Operating expenses. Operating expenses primarily include personnel, vehicle, delivery, handling, office, selling, and other expenses related to the distribution, terminal and storage of products and related supplies.
     Expenses associated with the delivery of products to customers (including vehicle expenses, expenses of delivery personnel and vehicle repair and maintenance) are classified as operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
     General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses primarily include wages and benefits and department related costs for human resources, legal, finance and accounting, administrative support and supply.
     Fair value measurement. We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. We determine fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:
     Level 1 Inputs—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.
     Level 2 Inputs—Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
     Level 3 Inputs—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.
     The fair value of our derivatives (see Note 12) was estimated using industry standard valuation models using market-based observable inputs, including commodity pricing and interest rate curves (Level 2). The fair value of our contingent liabilities (see Note 5) was determined using the discounted future estimated cash payments based on inputs that are not observable in the market (Level 3). We do not have any other assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
     Our other financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and long term debt. The carrying value of our trade and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to their highly liquid nature, short term maturity, or competitive rates assigned to these financial instruments. The fair value of long-term debt approximates the carrying value as the underlying instruments bear interest at rates similar to current rates offered to us for debt with the same remaining maturities.
     Concentration Risk. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained at financial institutions and, at times, balances may exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced any losses related to these balances.

 The following table provides information about the extent of reliance on major customers and gas suppliers. Total revenues from transactions with an external customer amounting to 10% or more of revenue are disclosed below, together with the identity of the reportable segment.
    
 | | Year Ended December 31,
Customer | Reportable Segment | 2016 | 2015 | 2014

Customer A | Crude oil pipelines and storage, NGLs distribution and sales | 123,530 | 252,969 | 164,115
Customer B | Crude oil pipelines and storage, NGLs distribution and sales | 76,367 | * | * 
Customer C | Crude oil pipelines and storage | 55,540 | * | * 
Customer D | Crude oil pipelines and storage, Refined products terminals and storage | * | * | 90,923 

       * Revenues are less than 10% of the total revenues during the period.
     We are party to various commercial netting agreements that allow us and contractual counterparties to net receivable and payable obligations. These agreements are customary and the terms follow standard industry practice. In the opinion of management, these agreements reduce the overall counterparty risk exposure.
     Income Taxes. We are a limited partnership, and therefore not directly subject to federal income taxes or most state income taxes. Our taxable income (loss) will be included in the federal income tax returns filed by the individual partners. Accordingly, no federal income tax provision has been made in our consolidated financial statements since the income tax is an obligation of the partners. We are subject to the Texas margin tax, which is reported in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
     ASC 740, “Income Taxes”, requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our state tax returns and disallows the recognition of tax positions not deemed to meet a “more-likely-than-not” threshold of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Our management does not believe we have any tax positions taken within our consolidated financial statements that would not meet this threshold. Our policy is to reflect interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our income tax expense, when and if they become applicable.
     Equity-Based Compensation. We account for equity based compensation by recognizing the fair value of awards on the grant date or the date of modification, as applicable, into expense as they are earned, using an estimated forfeiture rate. The forfeiture rate assumption is reviewed annually to determine whether any adjustments to expense are required.
     Comprehensive Loss.  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, comprehensive loss was equal to net loss.
     Recent Accounting Pronouncements.  In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. The amendment address the definition of what qualifies as a business to provide guidance to companies when determining whether the transaction should be treated as acquisitions of assets or businesses. The ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the potential impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
     In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.  The amendments in this ASU require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of 

 
  F-15

 
cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the potential impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
     In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 addresses specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the diversity that exists in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption of this ASU is permitted. We adopted ASU 2016-15 in the third quarter of 2016 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This standard makes several modifications to Topic 718 related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
     In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842). Lessees will need to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. It will be critical to identify leases embedded in a contract to avoid misstating the lessee’s balance sheet. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the potential impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
     In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; Eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial assets on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements and clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity’s other deferred tax assets. ASU 2016-01 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. This standard does not allow for early adoption except related to credit risk adjustment in other comprehensive income. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
     In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early application permitted and, upon adoption, may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We early adopted, retrospectively, ASU 2015-17. There is no impact from the adoption of this ASU as our deferred taxes are already presented under the non-current classification for all periods presented.

 
  F-16

 

     In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. ASU 2015-11 changes the measurement principle for inventory measured using any method other than LIFO or the retail inventory method from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value.  Net realizable value is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  ASU 2015-11 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption of this ASU is permitted.  The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Update Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for public and non-public entities reporting under U.S. GAAP for one year. The FASB also decided to permit entities to early adopt the standard but adoption is not permitted earlier than the original effective date for public entities. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) – Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Gross versus Net), which is intended to provide clarity to principal versus agent considerations when it comes to revenue recognition related to ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) – Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which provides clarity to a few items for identifying performance obligations and licensing where the board had received feedback on the issuance of ASU 2014-09. In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides clarity and narrows the scope on numerous issues that have arisen from feedback the board received on the issuance of ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, and ASU 2016-20 are not effective until ASU 2014-09 becomes effective. We are currently evaluating the potential impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
     3. Discontinued Operations
     Mid-Continent. On February 1, 2016, we sold certain trucking and marketing assets in the Mid-Continent area (the “Mid-Continent Business”) to JP Development, simultaneous with JP Development’s sale of its GSPP pipeline assets to a third party buyer. The sales price related to the Mid-Continent Business was $9,685,000, in cash, which included certain adjustments related to inventory and other working capital items. We recognized a loss on disposal of approximately $12,909,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, which primarily relates to the goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charge associated with the Mid-Continent Business. As of December 31, 2015, the Mid-Continent Business met all the criteria to be classified as asset held for sale in accordance with ASC 360, therefore, we classified all the related assets and liabilities as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we allocated $7,939,000 of goodwill to the Mid-Continent Business, which was based on the relative fair value of the disposed Mid-Continent Business and the portion of the crude oil supply and logistics reporting unit that was retained by us. The $7,939,000 was subsequently impaired and contributed to the overall net loss from discontinued operations. The operating results of the Mid-Continent Business have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated statements of operations. We combined the cash flows from the Mid-Continent Business with the cash flows from continuing operations for all periods presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Mid-Continent Business will not generate any continuing cash flows subsequent to the date of disposition. Prior to the classification as discontinued operations, we reported the Mid-Continent Business in our crude oil pipelines and storage segment. The following table summarizes selected financial information related to the Mid-Continent Business’ operations in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

      Bakken Business. On June 30, 2014, we (“Seller”) entered into and simultaneously closed an Asset Purchase Agreement with Gold Spur Trucking, LLC (“Buyer”), pursuant to which the Seller sold all the trucking and related assets and activities in North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming (the “Bakken Business”) to the Buyer for a purchase price of $9,100,000. As a result, we recognized a loss on this sale of approximately $7,288,000 during the second quarter of 2014, which primarily relates to the write-off of a customer contract associated with the Bakken Business. In addition, immediately prior to the sale, we allocated $1,984,000 of goodwill to the Bakken Business, which was based on the relative fair value of the disposed Bakken Business and the portion of the crude oil supply and logistics reporting unit that was retained by us. The $1,984,000 allocation contributed to the overall net loss from discontinued operations.
    
The Bakken Business operations have been classified as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 in the consolidated statements of operations. We combined the cash flows from the Bakken Business with the cash flows from continuing operations for all periods presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Bakken Business will not generate any continuing cash flows subsequent to the date of disposition. Prior to the classification as discontinued operations, we reported the Bakken Business in our crude oil pipelines and storage segment. The following table summarizes selected financial information related to the Bakken Business’s operations in the year ended December 31, 2014.

                  4. Net Loss Per Unit
     Net loss per unit applicable to common limited partner units and to subordinated limited partner units is computed by dividing the respective limited partners’ interest in net income for the period subsequent to the IPO by the weighted-average number of common units and subordinated units outstanding for the period. Loss per limited partner unit is calculated in accordance with the two-class method for determining loss per unit for master limited partnerships (“MLPs”) when incentive distribution rights (“IDRs”) and other participating securities are present. The two-class method requires that loss per limited partner unit be calculated as if all earnings for the period were distributed as cash, and allocated by applying the provisions of the partnership agreement, and requires a separate calculation for each quarter and year-to-date period. Under the two-class method, any excess of distributions declared over net income is allocated to the partners based on their respective sharing of income specified in the partnership agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, dilutive loss per unit was equal to basic loss per unit because all instruments were antidilutive.
     On January 24, 2017, the Board of Directors of our general partner declared a cash distribution for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $0.325 per common unit and subordinated unit.  The distribution was paid on February 14, 2017 to unitholders of record as of February 7, 2017.

                          5. Acquisitions and Dispositions
     2015 Acquisitions
     Acquisition of Southern Propane Inc. On May 8, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Southern Propane Inc. (“Southern”), a Houston-based industrial and commercial propane distribution and logistics company. The acquisition expanded the asset base and market share of our NGL distribution and sales segment, specifically the acceleration of our entry into the Houston, Texas market, as well as expansion of our industrial, non-seasonal customers. The total purchase price of $16,292,000 consisted of a $12,475,000 cash payment that was paid on the acquisition date, and which was funded through the use of borrowings from our revolving credit facility, a $108,000 cash payment to the seller as the final working capital adjustment, the issuance of 266,951 common units valued at $3,442,000 and a contingent earn-out liability with a value of $267,000 that is subject to the achievement of certain gross profit targets at Southern.  The earn-out period covers the period from June 2015 through December 2016, and the maximum earn-out that could be earned was $1,250,000. The common units issued with this acquisition were issued in a private offering conducted in accordance with the exemption from the registration requirements of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as such units were issued to the owners of a business acquired in a privately negotiated transaction not involving any public offering or solicitation. 
      The fair value of the contingent earn-out liability was estimated by applying an expected present value technique based on the probability-weighted average of possible outcomes that would occur should certain financial metrics be reached. That measure is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, which ASC 820 

 
  F-21

 
refers to as Level 3 inputs. The contingent earn-out was established at the time of the acquisition and is revalued at each reporting period. Based on the actual post-acquisition performance results and revised projections, we estimated the fair value of the Southern contingent earn-out liability to be $243,000 as of December 31, 2015, which is recorded in Other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2016, the Southern contingent earn-out liability was written off and we recognized a $243,000 gain for the year ended December 31, 2016.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $24,000 in income related to the changes in the fair value of the contingent earn-out liability.  Changes in fair value of the Southern contingent earn-out is included in Other income, net, in our consolidated statements of operations.  
    
The following table represents our allocation of the total purchase price of this acquisition to the assets acquired (in thousands):
    
Accounts receivable | $ | 932 
Inventory | | 24 
Total current assets | | 956 
Property, plant and equipment | | 2,962 
Intangible assets: | | 
Customer relationships | | 6,163 
Noncompete agreements | | 292 
Trade names | | 113 
Total identifiable net assets acquired | | 10,486
Goodwill | | 5,806 
Net assets acquired | $ | 16,292

      Goodwill associated with the Southern acquisition principally results from synergies expected from integrated operations. The fair values of the acquired intangible assets were estimated by applying the income approach. That measure is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, which ASC 820 refers to as Level 3 inputs. Trade names are amortized over an estimated useful life of one year, customer relationships are amortized over a weighted average useful life of 12 years, and non-compete agreements are amortized over a weighted average useful life of 5 years. 
     Revenues attributable to Southern included in the consolidated statements of operations totaled $5,766,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $3,849,000 for the period from May 8, 2015 to December 31, 2015. We do not account for the operations of Southern on a stand-alone basis, therefore, it is impracticable to report the amounts of net income of Southern included in the consolidated statements of operations related to the post-acquisition periods. 
     Disposition of crude oil supply and logistics assets. On September 30, 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold certain crude oil supply and logistics assets for a sales price of $1,914,000. We closed the transaction on November 2, 2015 and recognized a gain on disposal of $1,046,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.

      All of the shell capacity of our storage tanks in our crude oil storage facility in Cushing, Oklahoma is dedicated to one customer pursuant to a long-term contract with an initial expiration of August 3, 2017 and an optional two year renewal term. We did not receive notice of intent to renew the lease from that customer by the required date of February 3, 2017.

      Bank of America Credit Agreement. On February 12, 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (the “BOA Credit Agreement”), which was available for refinancing and repayment of certain existing 

 
  F-26

 
indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and general partnership purposes, including distributions, not in contravention of law of the loan documents and to pay off our existing WFB commitments and F&M Loans (as described below). The BOA Credit Agreement consisted of a $275,000,000 revolving loan, which included a sub-limit of up to $100,000,000 for letters of credit. The BOA Credit Agreement was scheduled to mature on February 12, 2019. On March 8, 2017, in connection with the closing of the AMID Merger, the BOA Credit Agreement was paid off in full and terminated.
     Borrowings under the BOA Credit Agreement bore interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, (2) the prime rate of Bank of America, and (3) LIBOR, subject to certain adjustments, plus 1.00% or (b) LIBOR, in each case plus an applicable rate. The applicable rate was (a) 1.25% for prime rate borrowings and 2.25% for LIBOR borrowings. The commitment fee was subject to an adjustment each quarter based on the Consolidated Net Total Leverage Ratio, as defined in the BOA Credit Agreement.
     As of December 31, 2016, the unused balance of the BOA Credit Agreement was $78,150,000. Issued and outstanding letters of credit, which reduced available borrowings under the BOA Credit Agreement, totaled $19,850,000 at December 31, 2016. We are required to pay a commitment fee on the unused commitments under the BOA Credit Agreement, which initially was 0.50% per annum. The commitment fee was subject to an adjustment each quarter based on the Consolidated Net Total Leverage Ratio, as defined in the BOA Credit Agreement.
     The BOA Credit Agreement contained various restrictive covenants and compliance requirements including:
     Maintenance of certain financial covenants including a consolidated net total leverage ratio of not more than 4.50 to 1.00 prior to the issuance of certain unsecured notes, a consolidated net total leverage ratio of not more than 5.00 to 1.00 from and after the issuance of certain unsecured notes, a consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio of not more than 3:50 to 1:00 from and after the issuance of certain unsecured notes, available liquidity (as defined in the BOA Credit Agreement) of not less than $25,000,000 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50 to 1.00.
     Financial statement reporting requirements, including quarterly unaudited financial statement reporting and annual audited financial statement reporting.
     Restrictions on cash distributions, including cash distributions to holders of equity units, unless certain leverage and coverage ratios are maintained before and after the cash distribution.
     We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2016.
     HBH Note Payable. We issued a $2,012,500 non-interest bearing promissory note in conjunction with the acquisition of HBH on November 15, 2011. The carrying value of this note is $950,000 and $1,077,000 as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which is based on an interest rate of 5.0%. This balance is payable every January and July through December 31, 2016 based on the number of meter connections above a threshold. The minimum amount due is $2,012,500. The final remaining balance on this loan was paid in full in January 2017. Accretion expense, included as a component of interest expense, totaled $54,000, $55,000 and $66,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The fair value measure is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, which ASC 820 refers to as Level 3 inputs.
     Non-Compete Notes Payable.  As part of the acquisition of Heritage Propane Express, LLC (“HPX”) in June 2012, we acquired several promissory notes, which were issued prior to acquisition by HPX as consideration for several non-compete agreements unrelated to the acquisition transaction. Each of the agreements had a five year term and is non-interest bearing. The fair value of the agreements was $117,000 at December 31, 2015, which was based on an effective imputed interest rate of 3.5%.  On September 19, 2016, we repaid the non-compete agreements in full.

 Wells Fargo Credit Agreement. We had a $20,000,000 working capital revolving credit facility and a $180,000,000 acquisition revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “WFB Credit Agreement”). Our outstanding borrowings under the WFB Credit Agreement were collateralized by substantially all of our assets.
     On February 12, 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America and used the borrowings under the Bank of America credit facility to repay all outstanding balances under the WFB Credit Agreement. As a result of the termination of the WFB Credit Agreement, we wrote off $1,634,000 of deferred financing costs during the year ended December 31, 2014.
     F&M Bank & Trust Company Credit Agreement. On July 20, 2012, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with F&M Bank & Trust Company for the purchase of new, and the refinancing of existing, vehicles and equipment. The F&M Bank Credit Agreement consisted of several term loans (collectively, “F&M Loans”). Our obligations under the F&M Loans were collateralized by our vehicles and equipment financed by these loans.
     On February 12, 2014, the outstanding balance on the F&M Loans of $4,135,000 was paid in full with the proceeds from the BOA Credit Agreement.
     Reynolds Note Payable. We issued a $645,000 non-interest bearing promissory note as partial consideration for the acquisition of Reynolds Brother Propane on May 1, 2012. The note was payable in two installments of $295,000 and $350,000 at the first and second anniversary of the acquisition closing date (i.e. May 1, 2013 and May 1, 2014), respectively. On May 1, 2014, we repaid the promissory note in full.
     Related Party Note Payable. On November 5, 2013, we issued a $1,000,000 promissory note to JP Development for working capital requirements. The note was to mature on November 5, 2016 and bore interest at 4.75%. On March 20, 2014, we repaid the promissory note in full.
     As of December 31, 2016, our scheduled principal repayments of long-term debt for each of the next five years ending December 31 and thereafter are as follows (in thousands):
    
2017 | $ | 950 |

          12. Derivative Instruments
     We are exposed to certain market risks related to the volatility of commodity prices and changes in interest rates. To monitor and manage these market risks, we have established comprehensive risk management policies and procedures. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than hedging commodity price risk and interest rate risk. That is, we do not speculate using derivative instruments.
     Commodity Price Risk. Our normal business activities expose us to risks associated with changes in the market price of crude oil, propane and refined products, among other commodities. Management believes it is prudent to limit our exposure to these risks, which include our (i) propane purchases, (ii) pre-existing or anticipated physical crude oil and refined product sales and (iii) certain crude oil held in inventory.  To meet this objective, we use a combination of fixed price swaps, basis swaps and forward contracts. At times, we may also terminate or unwind hedges or portions of hedges in order to meet cash flow objectives or when the expected future volumes do not support the level of hedges. Our forward contracts that qualify for the Normal Purchase Normal Sale (“NPNS”) exception under GAAP are 

 
  F-28

 
recognized when the underlying physical transaction is delivered.  While these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments under ASC 815, they are not recorded at fair value, but on an accrual basis of accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception, the fair value of the related contract is recorded on the balance sheet and immediately recognized through earnings.  
     In the first quarter of 2015, we entered into several long-term fixed price forward sale contracts related to certain barrels of crude oil we had on hand as of December 31, 2014, effectively locking these barrels at higher future sales prices in future periods.  These forward sale contracts were intended to mitigate the effect of the decline in crude oil prices, but did not qualify for NPNS accounting under GAAP, because of our normal business practice to buy and sell crude oil inventory either within the same month or in the following month. As a result, these longer than normal term forward sale contracts were given mark-to-market accounting treatment. As these forward sale contracts related to the marketing assets in our Mid-Continent Business (see Note 3), the fair values of the forward contracts have been classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015.  As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of the Mid-Continent forward contracts was $630,000 and was included in current liabilities of discontinued operations held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. 
       In August 2015, we paid approximately $8,745,000 to settle all of our then-outstanding propane financial swap contracts that were scheduled to mature at various dates through April 2017. We simultaneously executed new propane financial swap contracts at then current forward market prices for the purpose of economically hedging a substantial majority of our fixed price propane sales contracts through July 2017. 
      The following table summarizes the net notional volume buy (sell) of our outstanding commodity-related derivatives, excluding those derivatives that qualified for the NPNS exception as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, none of which were designated as hedges for accounting purposes. 
        
 | December 31, 2016 | December 31, 2015

Commodity Swaps : | | | | 
Propane Fixed Price (Gallons) | 4,364,880 | Jan 2017 - Nov 2018 | 8,614,631 | Jan 2016 - July 2017

Crude Oil Basis (Barrels) | 180,000 | Jan 2017 - Mar 2017 | — | — 

      Interest Rate Risk. We are exposed to variable interest rate risk as a result of variable-rate borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. We entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk on a portion of our debt with a variable-rate component. These swaps changed the variable-rate cash flow exposure on the debt obligations to fixed cash flows. Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, we received variable interest rate payments and made fixed interest rate payments, thereby creating the equivalent of fixed-rate debt for the portion of the debt that was swapped.  As of December 31, 2016, our outstanding interest rate swap contracts contained a notional amount of $100,000,000 with maturity dates ranging from January 2017 to January 2019. There were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2015.
     Credit Risk. By using derivative instruments to economically hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices and interest rates, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes the Partnership, which creates credit risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we owe the counterparty and, therefore, we do not possess credit risk. We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high- quality counterparties. We have entered into Master International Swap Dealers Association (“ISDA”) Agreements that allow for netting of swap contract receivables and payables in the event of default by either party.
    
 
  F-29

 

 Fair Value of Derivative Instruments. We measure derivative instruments at fair value using the income approach which discounts the future net cash settlements expected under the derivative contracts to a present value. These valuations utilize indirectly observable (“level 2”) inputs, including contractual terms, commodity prices, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals. None of our derivative contracts are designated as hedging instruments. The following table summarizes the fair values of our derivative contracts included in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.
    
 | | Asset Derivatives | | Liability Derivatives |

     We recognized total gains of $361,000 and losses of $1,962,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with respect to derivative instruments related to the Mid-Continent business which was included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations.
     In the consolidated statements of cash flows, the effects of settlements of derivative instruments are classified as operating activities, consistent with the related transactions.
                 13. Partners’ Capital
     Initial Public Offering. On October 7, 2014, we closed on our IPO of 13,750,000 common units, representing a 37.7% interest in us. Total proceeds from the sale of the units were $257.1 million, net of underwriting discounts and structuring fees. See Note 1 for details of the IPO and recapitalization transactions.
     Preferred Units. On March 28, 2014, we authorized and issued to Lonestar 1,818,182 Series D Convertible Redeemable Preferred Units (the “Series D Preferred Units”) for a cash purchase price of $22.00 per unit pursuant to the terms of a Series D Subscription Agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”) by and among us, JP Energy GP II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and general partner to the Partnership (the “General Partner”) and Lonestar. This transaction resulted in proceeds to us of  $40,000,000. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we issued to Lonestar 110,727 Series D PIK Units related to the distributions earned for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and the three months ended September 30, 2014. On October 7, 2014, we paid $42,436,000 from proceeds related to the IPO to redeem all then outstanding Series D Preferred Units.
     Common Units. On February 12, 2014, we issued 363,636 Class A Common Units to Lonestar for total net proceeds of $8,000,000. 
     With the exception of the distribution of proceeds upon a “Change of Control Event” as described in the Partnership Agreement, all Class A Common Units, Class B Common Units, and Class C Common Units (collectively, the “Existing Common Units”) had the same terms and conditions.
     Prior to the closing of the IPO, the Existing Common Units were split into approximately 0.89 common units, resulting in an aggregate of 22,677,004 outstanding Existing Common Units. An aggregate of 18,213,502 of the Existing Common Units held by existing partners were automatically converted into 18,213,502 subordinated units. Subsequent to the closing of our IPO, the remaining 4,463,502 Existing Common Units were automatically converted into common units on a one-to-one basis and we issued 13,750,000 common units to the public. 
     On May 8, 2015, in connection with the Southern acquisition, we issued 266,951 common units valued at $3,442,000.
    
On March 8, 2017, we were merged with and into Merger Sub and each of our common units issued and outstanding were converted into AMID Common Units. See Note 1 for details of the AMID Merger.
     Subordinated Units. In connection with the IPO, we executed the Third Amended and Restated Agreement
 of Limited Partnership (“Amended Partnership Agreement”) on October 7, 2014. Our Amended Partnership Agreement provides that, during the subordination period, the common units will have the right to receive distributions each quarter in an amount equal to $0.3250 per common unit, which amount is defined in our Amended Partnership Agreement as the minimum quarterly distribution (“MQD”), plus any arrearages in the payment of the MQD on the common units from prior quarters, before any distributions of available cash may be made on the subordinated units. These units are deemed "subordinated" because for a period of time, referred to as the subordination period, the subordinated units will not be entitled to receive any distributions until the common units have received the MQD plus any arrearages from prior quarters. Furthermore, no arrearages will be paid on the subordinated units. The practical effect of the subordinated units is to increase the likelihood that, during the subordination period, there will be available cash to be distributed on the common units. The subordination period will end, and the subordinated units will convert to common units, on a one-for-one basis, when certain distribution milestones described in the Amended Partnership Agreement have been met.

 
  F-31

 

     On March 8, 2017, we were merged with and into Merger Sub and each of our subordinated units issued and outstanding were converted into AMID Common Units. See Note 1 for details of the AMID Merger.
     General Partner Interest. As of December 31, 2014, the General Partner had 45 general partner units. On October 7, 2014, subsequent to the closing of the IPO, the 45 general partner units were recharacterized as a non-economic general partners interest in us.
     The non-economic general partner interest in us does not entitle it to receive cash distributions. 
     Distributions. Prior to our IPO, our Partnership Agreement required that, within 60 days after the end of each quarter, we distribute all of our available cash to unitholders of record on the applicable record date, as determined by the General Partner. In connection with the IPO, we entered into the Amended Partnership Agreement, which requires that, within 45 days after the end of each quarter, beginning with the quarter ending December 31, 2014, we distribute all of our available cash to unitholders of record on the applicable record date, subject to certain terms and conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we did not make any cash distributions.  During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we made the following cash distributions per unit:
    
Quarter Ended | Record Date | Payment Date | Cash Distributions (per unit) | 
December 31, 2014 | February 6, 2015 | February 13, 2015 | $ | 0.3038 | (1)
March 31, 2015 | May 7, 2015 | May 14, 2015 | $ | 0.3250 | 
June 30, 2015 | August 7, 2015 | August 14, 2015 | $ | 0.3250 | 
September 30, 2015 | November 6, 2015 | November 13, 2015 | $ | 0.3250 | 
December 31, 2015 | February 5, 2016 | February 12, 2016 | $ | 0.3250 | 
March 31, 2016 | May 6, 2016 | May 13, 2016 | $ | 0.3250 | 
June 30, 2016 | August 5, 2016 | August 12, 2016 | $ | 0.3250 | 
September 30, 2016 | November 4, 2016 | November 11, 2016 | $ | 0.3250 | 


(1) | Represents a prorated amount of our minimum quarterly distribution of $0.325 per common unit, based on the number of days between the closing of the IPO on October 7, 2014 and December 31, 2014.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We paid a cash distribution of $0.325 per common unit and subordinated unit on February 14, 2017. 
     The Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership provides that the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, make cash distributions, but there is no requirement that we make any cash distributions.
             14. Unit-Based Compensation
     Long-Term Incentive Plan and Phantom Units.  The 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) for our employees, directors and consultants authorizes grants of up to 3,642,700 common units in the aggregate.  Our phantom units issued under our LTIP are primarily composed of two types of grants: (1) service condition grants with vesting over three years in equal annual installments; and (2) service condition grants with cliff vesting on April 1, 2018. Distributions related to these unvested phantom units are paid concurrent with our distribution for common units. The fair value of our phantom units issued under our LTIP is determined by utilizing the market value of our common units on the respective grant date.
     

 
  F-32

 

 The following table presents phantom units activity for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:       
2016 
Phantom Units | Units | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value
Outstanding at the beginning of the period | 392,420 | $ | 12.99
Service condition grants | 362,743 | | 5.33 
Vested service condition | (96,513) | | 11.27
Forfeited service condition | (117,116) | | 10.81
Outstanding at the end of period | 541,534 | | 8.64 


2015 
Phantom Units | Units | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value
Outstanding at the beginning of the period | — | $ | — 
Service condition grants | 497,479 | | 12.84
Vested service condition | (8,250) | | 12.90
Forfeited service condition | (96,809) | | 12.26
Outstanding at the end of period | 392,420 | | 12.99

      Total unit-based compensation expense related to our phantom units was $1,691,000 and $849,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which was recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
     We expect to recognize $2.6 million of compensation expense related to non-vested phantom units over a weighted average period of 1.4 years. We have estimated a weighted average forfeiture rate of 32% in calculating the unit-based compensation expense.
    
Restricted (Non-Vested) Common and Subordinated Units.  Prior to the completion of our IPO on October 7, 2014, from time to time, we granted service condition restricted class B common units to certain key employees. Such service condition restricted common units require the recipients’ continuous employment with us and vest, according to the vesting schedule in each respective grant agreement, over certain periods, typically three to five years.
     Pursuant to certain employment agreements, as amended, between us and certain employees, we were obligated to grant restricted Class B common units to those employees upon their achievement of certain agreed-upon performance goals that were measured by different milestones. Different milestone achievements caused different amounts of restricted Class B common units to be awarded. The maximum amount of the restricted Class B common units that could have been issued pursuant to these employment agreements, as amended, was 100,000 units. Prior to year ended December 31, 2014, 75,000 restricted Class B common units were issued as a result of the employees’ achievement of certain milestones and the unit-based compensation expense related to these units have been fully recorded as general and administrative expenses in respective historical periods.  With respect to the remaining 25,000 restricted Class B common units to be issued, we estimated the probable number of years for the performance goals to be achieved and have recognized the related unit-based compensation expense over the estimated number of years.  During the second quarter of 2015, each employee terminated their employment with us prior to one employee achieving their performance goal related to the remaining 25,000 restricted Class B common units.  As a result, we reversed previously recognized unit-based compensation expense of $297,000 in the year ended December 31, 2015.        
Fair value of the restricted class B common units equaled the fair value of our common unit at the respective grant dates. We estimate the fair value of our common unit by dividing the estimated total equity value by the number of outstanding units. Estimated total equity value was determined using the income approach of discounting the estimated future cash flow to its present value. 

 
  F-33

 

    
Immediately prior to the IPO, each of our Class B common unit was split into approximately 0.89 common unit, then approximately 80.3% of the common unit was converted into subordinated unit and the remaining 19.7% was converted into common unit.
    
During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, unit-based compensation expense of $333,000, $460,000 and $1,789,000, respectively, was recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations related to these restricted units.

 The following table presents restricted (non-vested) common, subordinated and class B common units during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

We make distributions to non-vested restricted units on a 1:1 ratio with the per unit distributions paid to common units. Upon the vesting of the restricted units, we intend to settle these obligations with common units. Accordingly, we expect to recognize an aggregate of $228,000 of compensation expense related to non-vested restricted units over a weighted average period of 1.03 years.
         15. Commitments and Contingencies
     Legal Matters. We are involved in legal proceedings and litigation in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.
     Environmental Matters. We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Such environmental laws and regulations impose numerous obligations, including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, the incurrence of capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and restrictions on the generation, handling, treatment, storage, disposal and transportation of certain materials and wastes.
     Failure to comply with such environmental laws and regulations can result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial liabilities and even the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting our activities. We have established procedures for the ongoing evaluation of our operations, to identify potential environmental exposures and to comply with regulatory policies and procedures.
     We account for environmental contingencies in accordance with the ASC 410 related to accounting for contingencies. Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation, are expensed.
     Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or clean- ups are probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no significant environmental matters.
     Refined Products Terminals. In the third quarter of 2014, we discovered that certain elements of the product measurement and quality control at our refined products terminal in North Little Rock, Arkansas were not in compliance with industry standards and certain regulations. As a result, the terminal could under-deliver refined products to our customers and, consequently, recognize excess gains on refined products generated through the terminal’s normal terminal and storage process. We recognize revenues for refined product gains as the products are sold at the terminal based on current market prices. We have undertaken procedures to improve and remediate our measurement and quality control processes to be in compliance with industry standards and regulations, and have discussed this matter with our customers and have returned a certain amount of refined products to the majority of our customers. Because there are numerous elements inherent in the product measurement process that could affect the amount of refined product gains generated at the terminal, it is not practicable for us to accurately quantify this amount or the discrete period of refined product gains previously recognized that were caused by these specific issues. However, using available operational data and certain management assumptions, we have reasonably estimated the volume of refined products to be returned to our customers of approximately 24,000 barrels. During 2014, we returned approximately 20,900 barrels to our customers, which amounts to a value of $2,092,000. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 3,100 barrels remaining that were due to our customers, at an estimated value of $167,000. Accordingly, we recorded a $2,259,000 charge to operating expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. We completed the final settlement of the under-delivered product volumes in the third quarter of 2015, which resulted in a charge to operating expenses of $172,000 in the year ended December 31, 2015.
     Asset retirement obligations (ARO).  We have contractual obligations to perform dismantlement and removal activities in the event that some assets, such as storage tanks, are abandoned. These obligations include varying levels of activity including completely removing the assets and returning the land to its original state. We have determined that the settlement dates related to the retirement obligations are indeterminate. The assets with indeterminate settlement dates 

 
  F-35

 
have either been in existence for many years or are relatively new assets and with regular maintenance will continue to be in service for many years to come. In addition, it is not possible to predict when demand for the service will cease, and we do not believe that such demand will cease for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the date when these assets will be abandoned is indeterminate. With no reasonably determinable abandonment date, we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the associated ARO’s and therefore, no ARO liability is recorded as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Additionally, many of these assets could be re-deployed for a similar use. We will continue to monitor these assets and if sufficient information becomes available for us to reasonably determine the settlement dates, an ARO will be recorded for these assets in the relevant periods.
     Operating Leases. We lease various buildings, land, storage facilities, transportation vehicles and office equipment under operating leases. Certain of the leases contain renewal and purchase options. Our aggregate rental expense for such leases was $6,070,785, $5,741,000 and $4,806,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, we assumed a land lease in the acquisition of Parnon Storage, LLC on August 3, 2012. Equal payments of $10,000 are due each month over the remaining 41 year lease period with no implied interest rate noted in the lease agreement.
     Minimum future payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2016 and thereafter are as follows (in thousands):
            
2017 | $ | 4,670

                      16. Reportable Segments
     Our operations are located in the United States and are organized into three reportable segments: crude oil pipelines and storage; refined products terminals and storage; and NGL distribution and sales.
     Crude oil pipelines and storage. The crude oil pipelines and storage segment consists of a crude oil pipeline operation and a crude oil storage facility. The crude oil pipeline operates in the Permian Basin and consists of approximately 161 miles of high-pressure steel pipeline with throughput capacity of approximately 130,000 barrels per day and a related system of truck terminals, LACT bay facilities, crude oil receipt points and crude oil storage facilities with an aggregate of 140,000 barrels of storage capacity.  We also operate a crude oil storage facility that has an aggregate storage capacity of approximately 3,000,000 barrels in Cushing, Oklahoma.
     The crude oil pipelines and storage segment also consists of crude oil supply activities and a fleet of crude oil gathering and transportation trucks. We conduct crude oil supply activities by purchasing crude oil for our own account from producers, aggregators and traders and selling crude oil to traders and refiners. We also own a fleet of crude oil gathering and transportation trucks operating in and around highly prolific drilling areas such as the Eagle Ford shale and the Permian Basin.
     Refined products terminals and storage. The refined products terminals and storage segment has aggregate storage capacity of 1.3 million barrels from two refined products terminals located in North Little Rock, Arkansas and Caddo Mills, Texas. The North Little Rock terminal has storage capacity of 550,000 barrels from 11 tanks and has eight loading lanes with automated truck loading equipment. The Caddo Mills terminal consists of 10 storage tanks with an aggregate capacity of approximately 770,000 barrels and has five loading lanes with automated truck loading equipment.  In the second quarter of 2016, we completed the connection of the North Little Rock terminal to Magellan’s Little Rock 

 
  F-36

 
Pipeline. Following the connection, the North Little Rock terminal allows delivery from Enterprise TE Products Pipeline Company LLC and Magellan’s Little Rock Pipeline. The Caddo Mills terminal is primarily served by the Explorer Pipeline.  In the fourth quarter of 2016, we also completed our ethanol unit train expansion project at our North Little Rock terminal which significantly improved the terminal’s ethanol offloading efficiency and capacity, allowing for offloading of up to 108 car unit trains.
     NGL distribution and sales. The NGL distribution and sales segment consists of three businesses: (i) portable cylinder tank exchange (ii) NGL sales through our retail, commercial and wholesale distribution business and (iii) NGL gathering and transportation business. Currently, the cylinder exchange network covers 46 states through a network of approximately 20,000 locations, which includes grocery chains, pharmacies, convenience stores and hardware stores. Additionally, in seven states in the southwest region of the U.S., we sell NGLs to retailers, wholesalers, industrial end-users and commercial and residential customers. We also own a fleet of NGL gathering and transportation operations trucks operating in the Eagle Ford shale and the Permian Basin.
     Corporate and other. Corporate and other includes general partnership expenses associated with managing all of our reportable segments.
     Our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) evaluates the segments’ operating performance based on Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (minus) interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization expense, asset impairments, (gains) losses on asset sales, certain non-cash charges such as non-cash equity compensation, non-cash vacation expense, non-cash (gains) losses on commodity derivative contracts (total (gain) loss on commodity derivatives less net cash flow associated with commodity derivatives settled during the period), corporate overhead support from our general partner (expenses incurred by us but absorbed by our general partner and not passed through to us) and selected (gains) charges and transaction costs that are unusual or non-recurring.

                      17. Related Parties
     We performed certain management services for JP Development. We received a monthly fee of $50,000 for these services through January 2016. The monthly fee reduced general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations by $50,000, $600,000 and $600,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we also performed certain additional services for which we received $228,000.
     JP Development had a pipeline transportation business that provided crude oil pipeline transportation services to our discontinued Mid-Continent Business. As a result of utilizing JP Development’s pipeline transportation services during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred pipeline tariff fees of $372,000, $6,023,000 and $8,875,000, respectively, which have been included in net loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2015, we had a net receivable from JP Development of $7,933,000, primarily as the result of the prepayments made in 2014 for the crude oil pipeline transportation services to be provided by JP Development. We recovered these amounts in full in the first quarter of 2016.

 As discussed in Note 11, on November 5, 2013, we issued a $1,000,000 promissory note to JP Development for working capital requirements. The note was to mature on November 5, 2016 and bore interest at 4.75%. The interest rate was subject to an adjustment each quarter equal to the weighted average rate of JP Development’s outstanding indebtedness during the most recently ended fiscal quarter. Accrued interest on the note was payable quarterly in arrears. On March 20, 2014, we repaid this promissory note in full.
     As discussed in Note 3, on February 1, 2016, we sold certain trucking and marketing assets in the Mid-Continent area to JP Development in connection with JP Development’s sale of its GSPP pipeline assets to a third party.
     As discussed in Note 13, on February 12, 2014, we issued 363,636 Class A Common Units to Lonestar for total net proceeds of $8,000,000 and on March 28, 2014, we issued 1,818,182 Series D Preferred Units to Lonestar for proceeds of $40,000,000. On October 7, 2014, we paid $42,436,000 from proceeds related to our IPO to redeem all then outstanding Series D Preferred Units.
     As a result of the acquisition of our North Little Rock, Arkansas refined product terminal in November 2012, Truman Arnold Companies (‘TAC”) owns common and subordinated units in us. In addition, Mr. Greg Arnold, President and CEO of TAC, was also one of our directors and owned a 5% equity interest in our general partner through October 2016. Our refined products terminals and storage segment sold refined products to TAC during 2016 and 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014, our revenue from TAC was $244,000 and $8,952,000, which is included in NGL and refined product sales - related parties in the consolidated statements of operations.
     Our NGL distribution and sales segment also purchases refined products from TAC. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we paid $986,000, $1,124,000 and $1,964,000, respectively, for refined product purchases from TAC, which is included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. 
     Through April of 2015 and during all of 2014, we entered into transactions with CAMS Bluewire, an entity in which Arclight holds a non-controlling interest. CAMS Bluewire provides IT support for us. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we paid $132,000 and $422,000, respectively, for IT support and consulting services, and for purchases of IT equipment, which are included in operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and property plant and equipment in the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated balance sheets. 
     During the third quarter of 2014, we began performing certain management services for Republic Midstream, LLC (“Republic”), an entity owned by ArcLight. We charged a monthly fee of approximately $75,000 for these services. In September 2016, this monthly fee decreased to approximately $40,000 before ceasing in November 2016. The monthly fee reduced general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations by $665,000, $712,000 and $297,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the second quarter of 2015, we began performing crude transportation and marketing services for Republic. We charged $3,214,000 and $3,049,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for these services which is included in gathering, transportation and storage fees – related parties and crude oil sales – related parties on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had a receivable balance due from Republic of $436,000 and $646,000, respectively, which is included in receivables from related parties in the consolidated balance sheets.
     During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our general partner agreed to absorb $9,000,000 and $5,500,000 of corporate overhead expenses incurred by us and not pass such expense through to us. We receive reimbursements for these expenses from our general partner in the quarters subsequent to when they were incurred, which was $7,500,000 and $3,000,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In the first quarter of 2015, certain executive bonuses related to the year ended December 31, 2014 were paid on our behalf by ArcLight. In addition, ArcLight reimbursed us for expenses we incurred for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The total amounts paid on our behalf or reimbursed to us were $2,400,000 and $2,568,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were treated as deemed contributions from ArcLight. 
     Beginning July 2013, we have no employees. The employees supporting our operations are employees of GP II, and as such, we fund GP II for payroll and other payroll-related expenses we incur. As of December 31, 2016, we had a 

 
  F-40

 
payable balance due to GP II $134,000, which is included in payables to related parties in the consolidated balance sheets. 
     As discussed in Note 1, on March 8, 2017, in connection with the closing of the AMID Merger, we were merged with and into Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of AMID, with us surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMID.
