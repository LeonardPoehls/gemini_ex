 Item 1. Business
  
  Unless this report indicates otherwise the terms ”Versar,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Versar, Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries. Versar’s fiscal year end is based upon a 52 or 53 week year ending on the last Friday of the fiscal period and therefore does not close on a calendar month end. The Company’s fiscal 2017 included 52 weeks and fiscal 2016 included 53 weeks. Therefore, for comparative purposes, the year to date numbers presented will include an additional week of results for fiscal 2016.

 Business Overview
 
  Versar, Inc. is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1969. We are a global project management company providing value-oriented solutions to government and commercial clients in three business segments: (1) Engineering and Construction Management (ECM); (2) Environmental Services Group (ESG); and (3) Professional Services Group (PSG). We also provide tailored and secure engineering solutions in extreme environments and offer specialized abilities in onsite staff support, performance based remediation, and hazardous materials management.
 
 Versar’s fiscal 2017 proved to be eventful and challenging. The year began with a string of new contract awards, including the Architect-Engineer 2013 Environmental Services (A-E13ES) multiple-award contract with a combined contract ceiling of $500 million, an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract in support of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) worth up to $20 million, a $14.8 million task order for engineering and technical support in Afghanistan, and a $15.5 million task order to renovate a building at Hanscom Air Force Base. In December 2016, Versar announced an amendment to its loan agreement with Bank of America and then early in January 2017, a change in its Independent Registered Accounting Firm from Grant Thornton to Urish Popeck. Versar continued to work with its Chief Restructuring Officer (CRO) who served as a point of contact for Bank of America to manage cash flow throughout the fiscal year. In April 2017, the Company sold its UK Subsidiary PPS, Ltd. (PPS) for a cash value of $214,042.50. The Company is entitled to additional cash payments for PPS in a total of up to £400,000 contingent on PPS’ attainment of certain performance thresholds through the end of calendar year 2017 agreed upon with the buyer of PPS.
  
  Notwithstanding new contract awards, Versar operated at a financial loss for all four quarters in, and therefore, for all of, fiscal 2017. In response, the Company continued and expanded a wide range of deliberate cost cutting measures initiated during fiscal 2016 which continued through the first six months of fiscal 2017, the benefits of which will continue to be realized in future periods. We will continue to manage our costs based on financial performance. Versar continues to maintain a strong backlog of $136.0 million as a result of adjusting our bidding strategies and teaming partnerships, refining our capabilities, and making strategic hires. As a service-based company, our revenue is primarily derived from the provision of labor-based services, rather than capital-intensive product offerings. Thus, our revenue is driven by our ability to retain existing clients, attract new clients, provide quality project and program management at competitive rates, and identify and retain qualified employees.
  
 On September 22, 2017, the Company, KW Genesis Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingswood Genesis Fund I, LLC (the latter two “Purchaser”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement). The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, following completion of a tender offer for all outstanding common stock of the Company for a cash price of $0.15 per share, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the “DGCL”), Purchaser will be merged into and with the Company (the “Merger”). Any common stock not purchased in the tender offer will be exchanged for a cash price of $0.15 per share in the Merger. Following the consummation of the Merger, the Company will continue as the surviving corporation as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger will be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL, which provides that following consummation of a successful tender offer for a public corporation, and subject to certain statutory provisions, if the acquirer holds at least the amount of shares of each class of stock of the acquired corporation that would otherwise be required to approve a merger of the acquired corporation, and the stockholders that did not tender their shares in the tender offer receive the same consideration for their stock in the merger as was payable in the tender offer, the acquirer can effect a merger without the vote or written consent of the stockholders of the acquired corporation. Accordingly, if Purchaser consummates the tender offer, the Merger Agreement contemplates that the parties will effect the closing of the Merger without a vote of the stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

The largest ECM project during fiscal 2017 was the $109.5 million firm fixed price Design/Bid/Build runway repair task order at Dover Air Force Base (DAFB). This project was awarded on August 13, 2014 under Versar’s Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) Acquisition Task Order Contract (SATOC) IDIQ with the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC), held with our joint venture partner, Johnson Controls Federal Systems. The SATOC IDIQ primarily services USAF customers, providing a fast track, efficient method for execution of all types of facility repairs, renovations and construction. During the months of December 2016 through February 2017, the work on this task order stopped due to seasonal weather related conditions. Work resumed in March 2017. The main runway (01/19) was turned over to the USAF in September 2016 and the final phase of the project was fully turned over to the USAF on August 16, 2017. Versar is awaiting a pending modification with additional scope, which the Company anticipates will be resolved by December 2017.

  Revenue Earned by Geographic Location
 
  Our consolidated gross revenue for fiscal 2017 was $111.8 million, of which approximately $109.8 million was funded with U.S. currency and approximately $2.0 million was derived from our former subsidiary PPS, and funded in Pounds Sterling. Approximately 16% of our fiscal 2017 revenue was generated in international locations.
 
  Our consolidated gross revenue for fiscal 2016 was $167.9 million, of which approximately $165.7 million was funded with U.S. currency and approximately $2.2 million was derived from PPS, and funded in Pounds Sterling. Approximately 11% of our fiscal 2016 revenue was generated in international locations.
  
  Our Strategy
 
 In addressing fiscal 2017’s challenges, Versar has remained committed to our customers, shareholders, employees and partners. Going forward, Versar will continue to provide technical expertise to our primarily federal customers. We will focus on international construction management in austere environments, security solutions, ongoing investments in military base efficiencies and renovation, compliance and environmental remediation. The following elements are driving our strategy:
 
   1.
 Manage our business to the bottom line. We are committed to conservatively managing our resources to achieve positive net income, ensure shareholder value, and transform processes and procedures.


   2.
 Profitably execute current backlog. Our front-line project managers and employees will continue to control costs and streamline processes to profitably execute our current backlog. In addition, our support staff will redouble efforts to support our front-line employees efficiently and effectively serve our customers. We are committed to innovatively transforming our business processes to be as efficient and cost-effective as possible.


   3.
 Grow our pipeline. We are aggressively mining existing IDIQ contract vehicles to increase win rate. While we reduced support staff in our Business Development function, we remain committed to growing our pipeline and backlog by carefully managing our proposal efforts from identification through award to maximize our business development investments.


   4.
 Retain and attract the best people. Our employees are critical to the execution of our strategy and we are committed to attracting and retaining the employees required to achieve all the elements of our strategy.

 
 
  

 
 
  Competition
 
  Government contracting is a highly competitive industry, one in which price is often the deciding factor. In such an environment, Versar must differentiate our capabilities and offerings to ensure that our customers understand the value of our offerings. Versar carefully targets business development and sales efforts and develops strategic partnerships to enhance our competitive advantage.
 
  The acquisition of Versar Security Systems (VSS) in fiscal 2016 expanded our customer base to include the FAA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), among others, and increased our service offerings into higher margin classified construction. During fiscal 2017, we positioned the Company to expand these new capabilities to existing customers and existing capabilities to new customers.
 
  Backlog
 
  We report “funded” backlog, which represents orders for goods and services for which we have received firm contractual commitments. Based on its history, Versar believes that approximately 90% of funded backlog will be performed in the succeeding twelve- to eighteen-month period following the execution of the relevant contract. However, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately realize our full backlog. Additionally, other companies with similar types of contracts may not calculate backlog in the same manner we do, as their calculations may be based on different subjective factors or because they use a different methodology. Therefore, information presented by us regarding funded backlog may not necessarily be comparable to similar presentations by others.
 
  As of June 30, 2017, funded backlog was approximately $136.0 million, which was consistent with the funded backlog at the end of the fiscal 2016.
 
  Employees
 
  At June 30, 2017, we had 412 employees, of which 76% are engineers, scientists, and other professionals. 39% of our professional employees have a bachelor’s degree, 26% have a master’s degree, and 3% have a doctorate degree as their highest level of education earned.
