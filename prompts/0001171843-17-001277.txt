ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
Onvia is a Delaware corporation. In this report, when we refer to “Onvia,” the “Company” “we,” “our,” or “us,” we are referring to Onvia, Inc.
 
Company Overview
 
Our Vision
 
At Onvia, we believe there is a better way for government agencies and businesses to work together. The Business to Government, or B2G, marketplace is one of the largest, most unstructured and fragmented markets in the world. We believe that equipping this market with data and technology will build trusted connections between businesses and governments. These connections should make the B2G market more productive and efficient. By resolving the friction in this vital, complex, multi-trillion dollar marketplace, we can create mutual value for private and public sectors, taxpayers and society at large.
Our Business
 
Onvia is a leading commerce intelligence company at the core of B2G marketplace. Over the last 17 years Onvia has developed domain expertise and advanced technologies to curate data on millions of exchanged contracts, agencies and decision makers, vendors and channels, projects and investment plans, awards records and market trends. Onvia’s B2G Intelligence System (B2GIS) delivers quality leads, process agility and strategic foresight, equipping companies of all sizes to grow their public sector business and help government agencies gain procurement efficiency. Onvia was incorporated in January 2000 in the state of Delaware. Our principal corporate office is located in Seattle, Washington. Our securities trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “ONVI”.
Industry Background 
 
The United States public sector represents one of the largest markets in the world. This market represents 4,000 federal agencies, and 90,000 agencies at the state and local level. Overall, procurement spending represents a multi-trillion dollar industry with State, Local, and Education (SLED) opportunities representing roughly 70-80% of government spending. Recent legislation at the federal level, most recently the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act), is intended to address transparency at the federal level. However, these federal initiatives do not address the even greater transparency issue within the SLED market.
 
3

The variety, volume and unstructured nature of spending across so many unique regulatory districts makes the SLED market one of the most fragmented in the world. The procurement lifecycle is complex and unique to each agency.
 
The aggregation of these public procurement events individually provides limited value. This data must be complete, normalized, enhanced, structured, linked and classified to provide actionable spending insights by agency, vendor or procurement type. As a result, agencies do not have a comprehensive view of spending by their peer agencies, so procurement officers rely on their own historical activities to make significant procurement decisions. Businesses must evaluate a variety of incomplete procurement information sources to obtain limited intelligence to inform their decision-making. The lack of data transparency makes the B2G marketplace extremely inefficient for both agencies and businesses that sell to them.
 
Our Objectives
 
To create trusted connections between businesses and governments, we have established three objectives upon which we focus our efforts:
 

· | Increase our content coverage to become the authority in B2G commerce intelligence and analysis
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leverage our proprietary technology, including industry ontologies, business rules and search capabilities to consistently deliver highly targeted, proprietary data
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop workflow tools and integrations to help businesses efficiently qualify and pursue revenue opportunities
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Onvia’s B2G Intelligence System
 
Onvia’s B2GIS applies advanced data science and search technologies to transform unstructured government contracting data into meaningful commerce intelligence for buyers and sellers. Businesses leverage this system to increase their sales pipeline, pursue opportunities and make strategic decisions. Government agencies employ the B2GIS to improve process transparency and efficiency, identify potential suppliers, and to meet their fiduciary responsibilities to their constituents.
 
B2GIS equips buyers and sellers with:
 
• The highest volume and quality of contracting data
 • Quick integration into systems and workflows
 • Forward-looking data for strategic decision-making
 
Highest volume and quality of contracting data
 B2GIS provides the most comprehensive coverage of agencies and their procurement activity, with a goal of covering 95% of published dollar spending. B2GIS leverages Onvia’s robust database of proprietary public sector procurement which includes comprehensive historical and real-time information on procurement activities unavailable elsewhere in the marketplace. We provide access to over 5.0 million procurement-related records connected to over 400,000 companies from across approximately 86,000 procurement entities nationwide. These records are standardized, formatted and classified within our database each day. We harvest data on a daily basis from thousands of agencies and sources, processing millions of records every year. This enables us to typically publish 90% of all collected government solicitations within 24 hours of issuance. Opportunities are curated using state-of-the-art algorithms and machine tagging, which makes our contracting data extremely actionable and industry-relevant. B2GIS helps businesses discover more, relevant opportunities to help fill their sales pipelines. Agencies can use this data to make their procurement processes more efficient.
 
Integration to systems and workflows
 B2GIS makes pursuing relevant opportunities easier. Opportunities can be reviewed and pursued in multiple ways, whether through direct email notification, researched and qualified online using Onvia’s robust procurement database, or on a mobile device. The B2GIS also integrates directly into the major Client Relationship Management (CRM) platforms for easy tracking and follow up. Most importantly, businesses and agencies have on-demand access to their dedicated Client Success Manager (CSM). Our CSM team of domain experts is proficient in industry best practices and implementing data into business workflows. B2GIS helps clients accelerate their pursuit of relevant opportunities and potential partners.

Forward looking data for strategic decisions
 Onvia’s B2GIS extends the line-of-sight beyond just bids, providing advance notice of potential future contracts. Using the B2GIS, businesses can evaluate relevant information extracted from budgets, capital improvement plans and council meeting minutes, which may indicate that a future contract is being considered. Advance notice information, when combined with historical procurement data, can help businesses develop a proactive pursuit strategy designed to improve contract win rates.
 
We believe the B2GIS provides a significant competitive advantage to both businesses and government agencies.
 
B2GIS for Businesses
 Businesses use the B2GIS to grow their sales pipelines, accelerate their contract pursuit process, monitor competitors activity and other relevant channels, and anticipate future spending. A business leveraging the B2GIS has access to the following to support their tactical and strategic go to market processes:
 

· | Daily Lead Notification Emails
--+-------------------------------


· | Project Leads Search Portal
--+----------------------------


· | Agency and Decision-Maker Contacts
--+-----------------------------------


· | Vendors and Competitors Profiles
--+---------------------------------


· | Contract Renewal Timing
--+------------------------


· | Agency Expenditure Forecasts
--+-----------------------------


· | Purchase Orders Pricing Details
--+--------------------------------


· | CRM Integration
--+----------------

Onvia Exchange 
 Government agencies can use Onvia’s B2GIS to meet their fiduciary responsibilities to their constituents. Agencies participate in Onvia Exchange to improve process transparency and efficiency, identify and attract more qualified vendors, award more contracts to small and disadvantaged businesses, and ultimately make more informed procurement decisions. Access to the B2GIS is free to government agencies.
Our Technology Advantage
 
Onvia’s curation process makes analyzing millions of records easy. Today, other data providers typically use existing agency codes and keyword searches to identify relevant content. Agency contracts usually include many different deliverables, and using a single code or keyword may be inaccurate, return irrelevant results or miss critical projects. Onvia has developed a proprietary vocabulary or “ontology” to simplify the search process and improve the identification of projects. This ontology summarizes tens of thousands of synonyms and terms used by governments into a few thousand key industry terms. Onvia’s curation process uses natural language processing to determine the essence of a project and consistently categorizes the record using this taxonomy. Searching Onvia’s database using our ontology returns targeted results with minimal noise. Our ontology continues to improve every day. We review thousands of projects a day and use machine learning to identify and add new terms and language to our ontology, which further improves the accuracy and relevance of search results. Users of the B2GIS can focus on value added activities such as pipeline creation and pursuit strategies, instead of sifting through hundreds of irrelevant records every day.

Small businesses can receive the benefits of the B2GIS by subscribing to our self-service eCommerce solution.
 
We measure our business, excluding those companies that participate in our self-service eCommerce program with the following key metrics:
 
Annual Contract Value (“ACV”)
 ACV represents the annualized aggregate revenue value of all subscription contracts as of the end of the quarter. ACV is driven by annual contract value per client and the number of clients. Most of Onvia’s revenues are generated from subscription contracts, which are typically prepaid and have a minimum term of one year, with revenues recognized ratably over the term of the subscription. Onvia also receives revenue from multi-year content distribution partnerships, stand-alone management reports, document download services, and list rental services, which are not included in the calculation of ACV. Content license contracts are excluded from ACV. ACV excludes subscribers to the self-serve leads solution.
 
Total ACV at December 31, 2016 increased by 5% to $23.2 million compared to $22 million at December 31, 2015. Growth rate in ACV can fluctuate from year to year based on timing in the amount of ACV available for renewal in addition to the mix of tenured and first year clients expiring in each period as tenured clients tend to renew at a higher rate than first year clients.
 
Number of Clients
 Number of clients represents the number of individual businesses subscribing to our solutions.
 
As of December 31, 2016, Onvia’s total client base decreased 3% to 2,900 clients compared to 3,000 clients as of the same time one year ago, but flat with the third quarter of 2016.
Annual Contract Value per Client (“ACVC”)
 Annual contract value per client is the ACV divided by the number of clients and indicates the average value of each of our subscriptions.
 
Total ACVC at December 31, 2016 grew 10% to $8,024 from $7,283 one year ago. Growth in overall ACVC demonstrates that clients for an increasing percentage of our total client base are purchasing our forward looking intelligence solution, not just lead solutions.
Dollar Retention
 Dollar retention measures the dollars renewed on the available base of expiring contracts over the preceding twelve months. Dollar retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of subscription contracts renewed, including the value of contract upgrades, during the most recent twelve-month period by the total value of subscription contracts expiring over the same period. Dollar retention measures the percentage of dollars retained from the population of expiring contracts over a twelve-month period.
 
In the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, overall dollar retention was 89%, compared to 88% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Dollar retention can fluctuate from period to period due to the mix of first year and tenured clients expiring in each period, and timing of contract growth. Dollar retention, in conjunction with ACV, provides insight into our subscription retention rate and ability to generate future subscription revenue.
 
Client subscriptions are typically prepaid, have a minimum term of one year and revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription. Subscriptions are generally priced based upon the geographic range, nature of content purchased, and the number of users accessing the database.
 
Most of Onvia’s revenues are generated from sales to companies that leverage our information for their own internal use, and to businesses that license our content for redistribution. Revenue from businesses who license our content for resale to their own clients is classified as Content License revenue. Content license contracts are generally multi-year arrangements and typically have higher annual contract values than our subscription-based services. Revenue from content license agreements is recognized over the term of the agreement.

Our Government Clients 
 In June 2016 we launched Onvia Exchange, which provides government agencies access to the B2GIS in exchange for agency-maintained procurement data. Onvia Exchange offers access to a comprehensive library of 1.9 million solicitation records (bids/RFPs, specifications) to help public sector procurement professionals improve the efficiency of their formal solicitation processes. To gain access, government clients agree to make available to Onvia, either publically or directly, award and bid results for formal procurements. Data sets collected from agencies are integrated into our B2GIS and made available to both Business and Government clients.
 
Our public sector-facing presence extends back to 2001 when Onvia acquired DemandStar.com, Inc, which has been in operation since 1997 and is an e-procurement platform for governments.
 
Technology
 
We support our operations and business solutions using an advanced technology platform designed to serve a large and rapidly increasing volume of web traffic in a reliable and efficient manner without critical failures. Our systems are designed to:

• | Provide fast, secure and highly available visitor access to our websites; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Validate and process client requests promptly and accurately; 
• | Provide timely, comprehensive and accurate management-reporting capabilities;
• | Accommodate upgrades to features on our websites; 
• | Scale to accommodate growth in users and content; and 
• | Provide basic redundancy in case of component failures. 

 
Our systems use a combination of proprietary technologies and commercially available licensed technologies
 
Our web servers, database servers, transaction-processing servers and other core systems that conduct essential business operations are housed at a third-party offsite co-location facility.  Our co-location vendor provides 24x7 monitoring and engineering support in a climate-controlled and physically secure environment and our on-call operations personnel have 24x7 access to the facility.  Our data center has redundant communication lines from multiple Internet Service Providers and has its own emergency power and backup systems.  We house some non-critical systems such as development servers, quality assurance servers, and internal application servers at our headquarters in Seattle.  All our production platform related servers and the majority of lower environment servers are in the Seattle co-location facility and a passive secondary production site in Spokane for redundancy in case of some natural calamity.  Onvia has a redundant disaster recovery site located outside the Seattle geographical area for the Company mail system which provides full functionality in the event of disaster.  The onvia.com website and the CRM (Salesforce.com) system are both remotely hosted solutions and not directly managed by the Onvia technology group. Onvia uses select cloud strategies to securely manage compliance data for disaster recovery purposes.
 
In addition to maintaining responsibility for the technical architecture, security and uptime of our business solutions, our technology department works closely with the sales and marketing departments to ensure that client feedback for new features is incorporated into new products and services and that our investment in new product development is aligned with our clients’ needs and expectations.
 
Competition 
 
The market for comprehensive intelligence on the government procurement marketplace is underserved. Competitors include, to a limited extent, bid aggregators, industry analysts and government e-procurement platforms.
 
7

Our current and potential competitors include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

• | Information companies that target specific industry verticals covered by our services, such as Dodge Data & Analytics, Contractors Register, and ConstructConnect and Deltek, the last two of which were recently acquired by Roper Technologies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Lead generation and bid matching companies such as FedMarket.com, BidNet, BidSync and GovernmentBids.com. 

 
We may face additional competition in the future as well-funded companies pursue new government procurement and private sector database products and services. We must continue to differentiate ourselves by expanding our database, enhancing and normalizing our data, developing solutions with high switching costs, and maintaining a loyal base of repeat clients.  To achieve this we must continually invest in content and software applications to provide our clients with business insight and intelligence on the government procurement market.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market include, but are not limited to, breadth, depth and timeliness of content, content quality, base of existing clients, and client service. In order to excel at these principal competitive factors, we strive to achieve a superior understanding of our clients, offer valuable solutions to maximize the return on our clients’ investment in the public sector market, and sustain an efficient operating model in delivering these solutions. We believe that our current solutions compare favorably to competitive offerings available in the marketplace today based on the depth and breadth of content, daily updates, a comprehensive archive of procurement intelligence and a structured and disciplined customer care program designed to provide sustainable value to our clients during the course of their subscriptions.
 
Seasonality 
 
Our client acquisition business is subject to some seasonal fluctuations. The second and third quarters are generally slower than the first and fourth quarters for client acquisition. The construction industry is our single largest market and these prospects are typically engaged on projects during the spring and summer months, not prospecting for new work, which causes new client acquisition to decline compared to the first and fourth quarters in the year. For this reason, comparisons of the performance of our business quarter to consecutive quarter may not provide the most relevant information, and so in addition to sequential quarter comparisons our quarterly results and metrics should be considered on the basis of results for the whole year or by comparing results in a quarter with the results in the same quarter of the previous year.
Intellectual Property Rights 
 
Our future success depends in part on intellectual property rights, proprietary rights, and technology. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our internally developed products, documentation, and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws, which afford only limited protection. We cannot ensure that any of our proprietary rights will be viable or of value in the future because the validity, enforceability and type of protection of proprietary rights in Internet-related industries is uncertain and still evolving.
 
We license and will continue to license certain products integral to services from third parties, including products that are integrated with internally developed products and used jointly to provide key content and services. These third-party product licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and we may not be able to successfully integrate such third-party products into our solutions.
 
We presently have no issued U.S. patents. It is possible that we may not develop future proprietary products or technologies that are patentable and that the patents of others will seriously harm our ability to do business.
 
 We own the following registered trademarks in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office:  ONVIA, ONVIA and Design (current logo with orange circular design), DEMANDSTAR, QUOTEWIRE and BIDWIRE. We also own the following registered trademarks in Canada: ONVIA, ONVIA.COM, and ONVIA.COM and Design.
 
Employees 
 
As of February 1, 2017, we had 142 employees with the majority located at our headquarters in Seattle, Washington.
 
None of our employees are represented by a union or collective bargaining agreement. We have never had a work stoppage and consider relations with our employees to be good.
