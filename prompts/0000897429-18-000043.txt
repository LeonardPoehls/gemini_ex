ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Chico’s FAS, Inc.1, is a leading omni-channel specialty retailer of women's private branded, sophisticated, casual-to-dressy apparel, intimates and complementary accessories. We operate under the Chico's, White House Black Market ("WHBM") and Soma brand names in the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada. Our distinct lifestyle brands serve the needs of fashion-savvy women 35 years and older. We earn revenues and generate cash through the sale of merchandise in our domestic and international retail stores, our various e-commerce websites and our call center, which takes orders for all of our brands, and through an unaffiliated franchise partner in Mexico. We view our stores and Company-operated e-commerce websites as a single, integrated sales function rather than as separate sales channels operating independently. As of February 3, 2018, we operated 1,460 stores across 46 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada, and sold merchandise through 94 franchise locations in Mexico. 
Since 1983, we have grown by offering high quality and unique merchandise, supported by compelling marketing and outstanding personalized customer service. While each of our brands has a distinct customer base, the overall portfolio caters to a broad age and economic demographic, with household incomes in the moderate to high income level.
Our Brands
Chico’s
The Chico’s brand, which began operations in 1983, primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded clothing focusing on women 45 and older. The style sensibility is unique with an individual expression created to illuminate the women wearing the brand. Chico's apparel, including the Black Label, Zenergy and Travelers collections, emphasizes problem solving styles, comfort and relaxed fit. Accessories and jewelry are original and designed to elevate the clothing assortment, allowing our customer to individualize her personal style. Chico's is vertically integrated, controlling almost all aspects of the apparel design process, including choices of pattern, print, construction, design specifications, fabric, finishes and color through in-house designers, purchased designs and independent suppliers. 
The distinctive nature of Chico’s clothing is also reflected in its sizing, which is comprised of sizes 000, 00 (size 0-2), 0 (size 4-6), 1 (size 8-10), 2 (size 12-14), 3 (size 16-18) and 4 (size 20-22). Chico’s will occasionally offer half-sizes (up to 4.5), one-size-fits-all, petite sizes, short and tall inseams, and small, medium and large sizing for some items. The relaxed fit allows us to utilize this kind of sizing and thus offer a wide selection of clothing without investing in a large number of sizes within a single style.
White House Black Market
The WHBM brand, which began operations in 1985 and was acquired in September 2003, is dedicated to being a go-to style destination and authority on wardrobe building. WHBM primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded clothing focusing on women 35 and older. WHBM offers a modern collection for the way women live now, selling stylish and versatile clothing and accessory items, including everyday basics, polished workwear, black and white pieces, and feminine, all-occasion dresses. The accessories at WHBM, such as shoes, belts, scarves, handbags and jewelry, are specifically designed to coordinate with each collection, allowing customers to easily individualize their wardrobe selections. WHBM is vertically integrated, controlling almost all aspects of the apparel design process, including choices of patterns, prints, construction, design specifications, fabric, finishes and color through in-house designers, purchased designs and independent suppliers.

WHBM uses American sizes in the 00-14 range (with online sizes up to 16), including petite sizing, as well as short and long inseams, and small, medium and large sizing for some items. The fit of the WHBM clothing is tailored to complement the figure of a body-conscious woman, while still remaining comfortable.
Soma
The Soma brand, which began operations in 2004, primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded lingerie, sleepwear, loungewear, activewear, swimwear and beauty products focusing on women 35 and older. The Soma brand's core franchise emphasizes solutions, including vanishing back bras, vanishing edge panties, slimming leggings and cool nights sleepwear. Bras range in size from 32A-46HH. The sleepwear and loungewear offerings range from extra small to extra-extra large sizing. The beauty category consists of the Memorable, Enticing and Oh My Gorgeous lines of fine fragrance. The Soma team develops product offerings by working closely with a small number of independent suppliers to design proprietary products in-house and, in some cases, designs provided by its independent suppliers under labels other than the Soma brand.
Our Business Strategy
Our overall business strategy is focused on building a collection of distinct high-performing retail brands serving the fashion needs of women 35 and older. We seek to accomplish this strategy through our five focus areas: (1) evolving the customer experience, (2) strengthening our brands' positions, (3) leveraging actionable retail science, (4) building growth platforms and (5) achieving operational excellence. Over the long term, we may build our brand portfolio by organic development or acquisition of other specialty retail concepts if research indicates that the opportunity complements our current brands and is appropriate and in the best interest of the shareholders.
We pursue improving the performance of our brands by building our omni-channel capabilities, which includes managing our store base and growing our online presence, by executing marketing plans, by effectively leveraging expenses, by considering additional sales channels and markets, and by optimizing the merchandise offerings of each of our brands. We continue to invest heavily in our omni-channel capabilities in order to allow customers to fully experience our brands in the manner they choose.
We view our stores and Company-operated e-commerce websites as a single, integrated sales function rather than as separate sales channels operating independently. To that end, we often refer to our brands’ respective websites as the brand’s “largest store”. Customers may shop in one place and consummate the purchase somewhere else. Our domestic customers can return merchandise to a store or to our distribution center, regardless of where they purchased it. As a result, we maintain a shared inventory platform for our operations, allowing us to fulfill orders for all channels from our distribution center ("DC") in Winder, Georgia. We also fulfill in-store orders directly from other stores.
We seek to acquire and retain customers by leveraging existing customer-specific data and through targeted marketing, including e-marketing, television, catalogs and mailers. We seek to optimize the potential of our brands with improved product offerings, potential new merchandise opportunities, and brand extensions that enhance the current offerings, as well as through our continued emphasis on our “Most Amazing Personal Service” standard. We also will continue to consider potential alternative sales channels for our brands, including international franchising and licensing, wholesale opportunities and others.
In fiscal 2016, we began implementing cost reduction and operating efficiency initiatives, including realigning marketing and digital commerce, improving supply chain efficiency and reducing non-merchandise expenses. In fiscal 2017, we strengthened our brand positioning and began preparing for future growth. We are now intently focused on evolving the customer experience and leveraging actionable retail science to drive profitable retail sales. Additionally, we have launched multiple initiatives that utilize technology and new platforms to drive growth.

Our Customer Service Model
Our customers deserve outstanding and personalized customer service, which we strive to achieve through our trademark “Most Amazing Personal Service” standard. We believe this service model is one of our competitive advantages and a key to our continued success. An important aspect of our successful implementation of this model involves the specialized training we give sales associates to help meet their customers’ fashion and wardrobe needs, including clothing and accessory style, color selection, coordination of complete outfits and suggestions on different ways in which to wear the clothing and accessories. Our sales associates are encouraged to develop long-term relationships with their customers, to know their customers’ preferences and to assist those customers in selecting merchandise best suited to their tastes and wardrobe needs. Our brands utilize tablets in stores to access customer purchase history and style preferences as a clienteling tool that enhances the shopping experience in a personalized and efficient manner. 
We also serve our customers’ needs and build customer loyalty through our customer rewards programs. Our programs are designed to reward our loyal customers by leveraging the rich data our customers share with us to deliver a relevant and engaging experience with our brands. The benefits provided are routinely evaluated in conjunction with our overall customer relationship management and marketing activities to ensure they remain a compelling reason for customers to shop at our brands.

Our Boutiques and Outlet Stores
Our boutiques are located in upscale indoor shopping malls, outdoor shopping areas and standalone street-front locations in the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada. Boutique locations are determined on the basis of various factors, including, but not limited to: geographic and demographic characteristics of the market, nearby competitors, our own network of existing boutiques, the location of the shopping venue, including the site within the shopping center, proposed lease terms, anchor or other co-tenants, parking accommodations and convenience. Our merchandise is also sold through franchise locations in Mexico, including boutique locations as well as shop-in-shop formats within a department store environment. 
Our outlet stores are primarily located in quality outlet centers. The Chico’s and WHBM brand outlets, including our hybrid Chico's Off the Rack format, contain a mixture of made-for-outlet and clearance merchandise. The made-for-outlet product carries a higher margin than the clearance items from our boutique stores. Soma outlets contain a mix of boutique and clearance merchandise. We also sell clearance merchandise on our websites. We regularly review the appropriate ratio of made-for-outlet and clearance merchandise sold at our outlets and adjust that ratio as appropriate.

1Our fiscal years end on the Saturday closest to January 31 and are designated by the calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. The periods presented in these financial statements are the fiscal years ended February 3, 2018 (“fiscal 2017”, “2017” or “current period”), January 28, 2017 (“fiscal 2016”, “2016” or “prior period”), January 30, 2016 (“fiscal 2015” or “2015”), January 31, 2015 (“fiscal 2014” or “2014”) and February 1, 2014 (“fiscal 2013” or “2013”). Each of these periods had 52 weeks, except for fiscal 2017, which consisted of 53 weeks. 
In fiscal 2018, we anticipate approximately 50 net store closures. We continuously evaluate the appropriate new store growth rate and closures in light of economic conditions and may adjust the growth rate and closures as conditions require or as opportunities arise. Our unaffiliated franchisee expects to continue opening franchise locations in Mexico.
Digital Commerce
Each of our brands has a digital flagship: www.chicos.com, www.whbm.com and www.soma.com, which provide customers the ability to browse and order merchandise, locate our stores and engage with content to enhance the shopping experience. Additionally, in fiscal 2017, we launched www.chicosofftherack.com, a new e-commerce site that gives customers 24/7 access to the same exclusive styles available at our Chico's Outlet locations. Our websites are designed to complement the in-store experience and play a vital role in both our omni-channel strategy and the customer experience. Some products are available exclusively online including extended sizes, additional style and color choices, premier partner brands and clearance items. Online merchandise is also available for order through our call centers and in our stores through our clienteling applications. Domestic customers may return product directly to our DC or in our store locations regardless of the channel in which the merchandise was purchased.

We remain focused on our efforts to better align with shifts in customer traffic and consumers' consumption of media and content. As a result of significant increases in mobile traffic, in 2016 we implemented a responsive website design for Chico's and WHBM to ensure a consistent and seamless customer experience across devices. In fiscal 2017, we completed the responsive website design conversion for Soma. We will maintain focus on our omni-channel approach by enhancing all brand websites through new features, functionality, search engine optimization and content designed to improve and evolve the customer's experience. 
Marketing and Advertising 
Driven by our industry-leading transactional data, our brands continue to develop targeted and effective marketing strategies. We continue to optimize and shift advertising from traditional to digital media with a focus on attracting new customers and using predictive modeling and advanced segmentation to drive retention and reactivation. 
Our marketing programs currently consists of the following media mix to engage current and prospective customers:

• | Loyalty and rewards programs;


• | Direct marketing: catalogs, postcards, email and calling campaigns;


• | Digital marketing: mobile paid search, product listing ads, display banner advertising and remarketing, affiliate programs;


• | Social marketing: organic and paid efforts across social platforms;


• | National and local print and broadcast advertising;


• | Editorial content;


• | Public relations; and


• | Charitable giving and outreach programs.

In 2018, our marketing efforts will remain focused on attracting customers to our iconic brands' differentiated positioning by leveraging retail science and introducing alternative sales channels.
Information Technology/Data Analytics
We are committed to having information systems that enable us to obtain, analyze and act upon information on a timely basis and to maintain effective financial and operational controls. This effort includes testing of new products and applications so that we are able to take advantage of technological developments to support and enhance our processes across all areas of our business. We use a proprietary customer database, together with data analytics, to customize our communications and make targeted offers to customers in an effort to increase traffic in-store and online and to increase conversion.
Merchandise Distribution
The distribution functions for all brands are handled from our DC in Winder, Georgia. New merchandise is generally received daily at the DC. Imported merchandise is shipped from the country of export by sea, air, truck or rail, as circumstances require. Domestic merchandise is primarily shipped by truck or rail. Upon arrival at the DC, merchandise is sorted and packaged for shipment to individual stores or is held for future store replenishment or direct shipment to customers. Merchandise is generally pre-ticketed with price and related informational tags at the point of manufacture. 
Our DC has been granted Foreign Trade Zone status from the Department of Commerce and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This status facilitates international expansion and allows us to move certain merchandise to the DC without paying U.S. Customs duty until the merchandise is shipped to domestic stores or online customers.
Product Sourcing
Our product sourcing activities are performed by a centralized shared service team focused on identifying cost-effective opportunities to improve production speed and flexibility while maintaining our quality standards. In fiscal 2017, China sources accounted for approximately 52% of our merchandise cost. We take ownership in the foreign country, at a designated point of entry into the United States, or at our DC, depending on the specific terms of sale. 
We purchase the majority of our merchandise through key suppliers with whom we have established strategic collaborations; these key suppliers represented 61% of our purchases in fiscal 2017 with our largest supplier accounting for 23% of the total. Currently, we believe our product sourcing is appropriately distributed among suppliers and across countries of manufacture taking into consideration product quality execution, flexibility and speed at an acceptable cost and level of risk.

Competition
The women’s retail apparel and intimate apparel business is highly competitive and includes local, national and international department stores, specialty stores, boutique stores, catalog companies and online retailers. We believe that our distinctively designed merchandise offerings and emphasis on customer service distinguish us from our competitors.
