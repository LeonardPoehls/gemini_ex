ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in 1985 and our principal executive offices are located at 80 Park Plaza, Newark, New Jersey 07102. We conduct our business through two direct wholly owned subsidiaries, PSE&G and Power, each of which also has its principal executive offices at 80 Park Plaza, Newark, New Jersey 07102. 
We are an energy company with a diversified business mix. Our operations are located primarily in the Northeastern and Mid- Atlantic United States. Our business approach focuses on operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment. As a holding company, our profitability depends on our subsidiaries’ operating results. Below are descriptions of our two principal direct operating subsidiaries.

PSE&G | Power 
A New Jersey corporation, incorporated in 1924, which is a franchised public utility in New Jersey. It is also the provider of last resort for gas and electric commodity service for end users in its service territory. Earns revenues from its regulated rate tariffs under which it provides electric transmission and electric and gas distribution to residential, commercial and industrial customers in its service territory. It also offers appliance services and repairs to customers throughout its service territory. Has also implemented regulated demand response and energy efficiency programs and invested in solar generation within New Jersey. | A Delaware limited liability company formed in 1999 as a result of the deregulation and restructuring of the electric power industry in New Jersey. It integrates the operations of its merchant nuclear and fossil generating assets with its wholesale power marketing businesses through competitive energy sales in well-developed energy markets and fuel supply functions. Earns revenues from the generation and marketing of power and natural gas to hedge business risks and optimize the value of its portfolio of power plants, other contractual arrangements and oil and gas storage facilities. This is achieved primarily by selling power and transacting in natural gas and other energy-related products, on the spot market or using short-term or long-term contracts for physical and financial products. Also earns revenues from solar generation under long-term sales contracts for power and environmental products.

Our other direct wholly owned subsidiaries are: PSEG Energy Holdings L.L.C. (Energy Holdings), which earns its revenues primarily from its portfolio of lease investments; PSEG Long Island LLC (PSEG LI), which operates the Long Island Power Authority’s (LIPA) transmission and distribution (T&D) system under a contractual agreement; and PSEG Services Corporation (Services), which provides us and our operating subsidiaries with certain management, administrative and general services at cost.
The following is a more detailed description of our business, including a discussion of our:

• | Business Operations and Strategy


• | Competitive Environment


• | Employee Relations


• | Regulatory Issues


• | Environmental Matters

BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY
PSE&G
Our regulated transmission and distribution public utility, PSE&G, distributes electric energy and gas to customers within a designated service territory running diagonally across New Jersey where approximately 6.2 million people, or about 70% of
New Jersey’s population resides.
 .

Products and Services
Our utility operations primarily earn margins through the transmission and distribution of electricity and the distribution of gas.

• | Transmission—the movement of electricity at high voltage from generating plants to substations and transformers, where it is then reduced to a lower voltage for distribution to homes, businesses and industrial customers. Our revenues for these services are based upon tariffs approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).


• | Distribution—the delivery of electricity and gas to the retail customer’s home, business or industrial facility. Our revenues for these services are based upon tariffs approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU).

The commodity portion of our utility business’ electric and gas sales is managed by basic generation service (BGS) and basic gas supply service (BGSS) suppliers. Pricing for those services are set by the BPU as a pass-through, resulting in no margin for our utility operations. 
We also earn margins through competitive services, such as appliance repair.
In addition to our current utility products and services, we have implemented several programs to invest in regulated solar generation within New Jersey, including:

• | programs to help finance the installation of solar power systems throughout our electric service area, and


• | programs to develop, own and operate solar power systems.

We have also implemented a set of energy efficiency and demand response programs to encourage conservation and energy efficiency by providing energy and cost saving measures directly to businesses and families. For additional information concerning these programs and the components of our tariffs, see Regulatory Issues—State Regulation and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities.
How PSE&G Operates
We are a transmission owner in PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM) and we provide distribution service to 2.2 million electric customers and 1.8 million gas customers in a service area that covers approximately 2,600 square miles running diagonally across New Jersey. We serve the most heavily populated, commercialized and industrialized territory in New Jersey, including its six largest cities and approximately 300 suburban and rural communities.
Transmission
We use formula rates for our transmission cost of service and investments. Formula-type rates provide a method of rate recovery where the transmission owner annually determines its revenue requirements through a fixed formula that considers Operation and Maintenance expenditures, rate base and capital investments and applies an approved return on equity (ROE) in developing the weighted average cost of capital. Under this formula, rates are put into effect in January of each year based upon our internal forecast of annual expenses and capital expenditures. Rates are subsequently trued up to reflect actual annual expenses and capital expenditures. Our current approved rates provide for a base ROE of 11.68% on existing and new transmission investment, while certain investments are entitled to earn an additional incentive rate. For more information, see Regulatory Issues—Federal Regulation.
We continue to invest in transmission projects that are included for review in the FERC-approved PJM transmission expansion process. These projects focus on reliability improvements and replacement of aging infrastructure with anticipated capital spend of $4.1 billion for transmission in 2017-2019 as disclosed in Item 7. MD&A—Capital Requirements.    
Distribution
PSE&G distributes gas and electricity to end users in our respective franchised service territories. Our approved rates, established in our most recent gas and electric base rate proceeding completed in mid-2010, provide for a ROE of 10.3% on distribution rate base. We are required to file our next distribution base rate case proceeding no later than November 1, 2017. The BPU has also approved a series of PSE&G infrastructure, energy efficiency and renewable energy investment programs with cost recovery through various clause mechanisms, with approved ROEs ranging from 9.75% to 10.3%. Our load requirements are split among residential, commercial and industrial customers, as described in the following table for 2016:
3


 | % of 2016 Sales
Customer Type | Electric | Gas 
Commercial | 58% | 37% 
Residential | 33% | 59% 
Industrial | 9% | 4% 
Total | 100% | 100%

While our customer base has modestly increased since 2012, electric load has declined and gas load has increased as illustrated below: 

Electric and Gas Distribution Statistics | 
 | December 31, 2016 | 
 | Number ofCustomers | Electric Sales and GasFirm Sales (A) | Historical Annual Load Growth 2012-2016
Electric | 2.2 | Million | 41,580 | Gigawatt hours (GWh) | (0.4)%
Gas | 1.8 | Million | 2,360 | Million Therms | 0.7% 


(A) | Excludes sales from Gas rate classes that do not impact margin, specifically Contract, Non-Firm Transportation, Cogeneration Interruptible and Interruptible Services.

The decline in electric sales is the result of changes in customer usage patterns, including conservation and more energy efficient appliances. Gas firm sales increased as a result of lower gas prices. Only gas firm sales impact margin. 
During 2016, PSE&G, as part of its BPU-approved $1.2 billion Energy Strong Program, completed the replacement and modernization of 240 miles of low-pressure cast iron gas mains in or near flood areas. PSE&G continues to execute the Energy Strong Program to (1) upgrade all of its electric substations that were damaged by water in recent storms; make investments that will create redundancy in the electric distribution system, reducing outages when damage occurs; and deploy technologies to better monitor system operations, enabling PSE&G to restore customers more quickly in the event of an electric outage, and (2) with respect to PSE&G’s gas system, upgrade five natural gas metering stations and a liquefied natural gas station recently affected by severe weather or located in flood zones. 
PSE&G also commenced modernizing its gas distribution system as part of our Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP) which was approved by the BPU in late 2015. The GSMP, through which we will invest $905 million over three years, will replace approximately 510 miles of cast iron and unprotected steel gas mains and about 38,000 unprotected steel service lines to homes and businesses, including the uprating of the mains to higher pressure. The mains and service lines will be replaced with stronger, more durable plastic piping, reducing the potential for leaks and release of methane gas. The new elevated pressure systems also enable the installation of excess flow valves that automatically shut off gas flow if a service line is damaged, and better support the use of high-efficiency appliances. 
Solar Generation
In order to support New Jersey’s Energy Master Plan and the state’s renewable energy goals, we have undertaken two major solar initiatives at PSE&G, the Solar Loan Program and the Solar 4 All and Solar 4 All Extension Programs. Our Solar Loan Program provides solar system financing to our residential and commercial customers. The loans are repaid with cash or solar renewable energy certificates (SRECs). We sell the SRECs received through periodic auctions and use the proceeds to offset program costs. Our Solar 4 All Programs invest in utility-owned solar photovoltaic (PV) centralized solar systems installed on PSE&G property and third-party sites, including landfill facilities, and solar panels installed on distribution system poles in our electric service territory. We sell the energy and capacity from the systems in the PJM wholesale electricity market. In addition, we sell SRECs generated by the projects through the same periodic auction used in the loan program, the proceeds of which are used to offset program costs.

Supply
Although commodity revenues make up almost 41% of our revenues, we make no margin on the default supply of electricity and gas since the actual costs are passed through to our customers.
All electric and gas customers in New Jersey have the ability to choose their own electric energy and/or gas supplier. Pursuant to BPU requirements, we serve as the supplier of last resort for two types of electric and gas customers within our service territory that are not served by another supplier. The first type, which represents about 80% of PSE&G’s load requirements, provides default supply service for smaller industrial and commercial customers and residential customers at seasonally-adjusted fixed prices for a three-year term (BGS-Residential Small Commercial Pricing (RSCP)). These rates change annually on June 1 and are based on the average price obtained at auctions in the current year and two prior years. The second type provides default supply for larger customers, with energy priced at hourly PJM real-time market prices for a contract term of 12 months (BGS-Commercial Industrial Energy Pricing (CIEP)).
We procure the supply to meet our BGS obligations through auctions authorized by the BPU for New Jersey’s total BGS requirement. These auctions take place annually in February. Results of these auctions determine which energy suppliers are authorized to supply BGS to New Jersey’s electric distribution companies (EDCs). Once validated by the BPU, electricity prices for BGS service are set. Approximately one-third of PSE&G’s total BGS-RSCP eligible load is auctioned each year for a three-year term. For information on current prices, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. 
PSE&G procures the supply requirements of its default service BGSS gas customers through a full-requirements contract with Power. The BPU has approved a mechanism designed to recover all gas commodity costs related to BGSS for residential customers. BGSS filings are made annually by June 1 of each year, with an effective date of October 1. PSE&G’s revenues are matched with its costs using deferral accounting, with the goal of achieving a zero cumulative balance by September 30 of each year. In addition, we have the ability to put in place two self-implementing BGSS increases on December 1 and February 1 of up to 5% and also may reduce the BGSS rate at any time and/or provide bill credits. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities for information on recent self-implementing credits. Any difference between rates charged under the BGSS contract and rates charged to our residential customers is deferred and collected or refunded through adjustments in future rates. Commercial and industrial customers that do not select third-party suppliers are also supplied under the BGSS arrangement. These customers are charged a market-based price largely determined by prices for commodity futures contracts.
Markets and Market Pricing
Historically, there has been significant volatility in commodity prices. Such volatility can have a considerable impact on us since a rising commodity price environment results in higher delivered electric and gas rates for customers. This could result in decreased demand for electricity and gas, increased regulatory pressures and greater working capital requirements as the collection of higher commodity costs from our customers may be deferred under our regulated rate structure. A declining commodity price on the other hand, would be expected to have the opposite effect. For additional information, including the impact of natural gas commodity prices on electricity prices such as BGS, see Item 7. MD&A—Executive Overview of 2016 and Future Outlook.
Power
Through Power, we seek to produce low-cost electricity by efficiently operating our nuclear, coal, gas, oil-fired and renewable generation assets while balancing generation output, fuel requirements and supply obligations through energy portfolio management. Our commitments for load, such as BGS in New Jersey and other bilateral supply contracts, are backed by the generation we own and may be combined with the use of physical commodity purchases and financial instruments from the market to optimize the economic efficiency of serving the load. Power is a public utility within the meaning of the Federal Power Act and the payments it receives and how it operates are subject to FERC regulation. Power is also subject to certain regulatory requirements imposed by state utility commissions such as those in New York and Connecticut.
Products and Services
As a merchant generator and power marketer, our profit is derived from selling a range of products and services under contract to an array of customers including utilities, other power marketers, such as retail energy providers, or counterparties in the open market. These products and services may be transacted bilaterally or through exchange markets and include but are not limited to:

• | Energy—the electrical output produced by generation plants that is ultimately delivered to customers for use in lighting, heating, air conditioning and operation of other electrical equipment. Energy is our principal product and is priced on a usage basis, typically in cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) or dollars per megawatt hour (MWh).

5


• | Capacity—distinct from energy, capacity is a market commitment that a given generation unit will be available to an Independent System Operator (ISO) for dispatch to produce energy when it is needed to meet system demand. Capacity is typically priced in dollars per MW for a given sale period (e.g. day or month).


• | Ancillary Services—related activities supplied by generation unit owners to the wholesale market that are required by the ISO to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the bulk power system. Owners of generation units may bid units into the ancillary services market in return for compensatory payments. Costs to pay generators for ancillary services are recovered through charges collected from market participants.


• | Congestion and Renewable Energy Credits—Congestion credits (or Financial Transmission Rights) are financial instruments that entitle the holder to a stream of revenues (or charges) based on the hourly congestion price differences across a transmission path. Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) are obtained through Power’s owned renewable generation or purchased in the open market. Electric suppliers of load are required to deliver a certain amount or percentage of their delivered power from renewable resources as mandated by applicable regulatory requirements.

Power also sells wholesale natural gas, primarily through a full-requirements BGSS contract with PSE&G to meet the gas supply requirements of PSE&G’s customers. On March 19, 2014, the BPU approved an extension of the long-term BGSS contract to March 31, 2019 and then year-to-year thereafter unless terminated by either party with a two year notice.
Approximately 45% of PSE&G’s peak daily gas requirements is provided from Power’s firm gas transportation capacity, which is available every day of the year. Power satisfies the remainder of PSE&G’s requirements from storage contracts, liquefied natural gas, seasonal purchases, contract peaking supply and propane. Based upon the availability of natural gas beyond PSE&G’s daily needs, Power sells gas to others and uses it for its generation fleet.
In addition to its nuclear and fossil generation fleet, Power owns and operates 326 MW direct current (dc) of PV solar generation facilities and has an additional 70 MW dc of PV solar generation in construction. Power has a 50% ownership interest in a 208 MW oil-fired generation facility in Hawaii. 
The remainder of this section about Power covers our nuclear and fossil fleet in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions which comprises the vast majority of Power’s operations and financial performance.
How Power’s Generation Operates
Nearly all of our generation capacity consists of nuclear and fossil generation (11,681 MW) that is located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States in some of the country’s largest and most developed electricity markets. For additional information see Item 2. Properties.
The map below shows the locations of our Northeast and Mid-Atlantic nuclear and fossil generation facilities and projects under construction:

• | Generation Capacity

Our nuclear and fossil installed capacity utilizes a diverse mix of fuels. As of December 31, 2016, our fuel mix was comprised of 41% gas, 32% nuclear, 20% coal, 5% oil and 2% pumped storage. This fuel mix does not give effect to our previously announced decision to cease generation operations of the existing coal/gas units at our Hudson and Mercer generating stations on June 1, 2017. This fuel diversity helps to mitigate risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand cycles. Our total generating output in 2016 was approximately 52,000 GWh. The generation mix by fuel type in recent years has reflected the relatively more favorable price of natural gas compared to coal, making it more economical to run certain of our gas units in place of our coal units. The following table indicates the proportionate share of generating output by fuel type in 2016.
Generation by Fuel Type (A) | Actual 2016 | 
Nuclear: | | 
New Jersey facilities | 36% | 
Pennsylvania facilities | 21% | 
Fossil: | |

• | Generation Dispatch

Our generation units have historically been characterized as serving one or more of three general energy market segments: base load; load following; and peaking, based on their operating capability and performance. 

• | Base Load Units run the most and typically are called to operate whenever they are available. These units generally derive revenues from both energy and capacity sales. Variable operating costs are low due to the combination of highly efficient operations and the use of relatively lower-cost fuels. Performance is generally measured by the unit’s “capacity factor,” or the ratio of the actual output to the theoretical maximum output. In 2016, our base load capacity factors were as follows:

7

 
Unit | 2016CapacityFactor
Nuclear | 
Salem Unit 1 | 67.0% 
Salem Unit 2 | 84.3% 
Hope Creek | 89.8% 
Peach Bottom Unit 2 | 91.7% 
Peach Bottom Unit 3 | 100.0% 
Coal | 
Keystone | 68.4% 
Conemaugh | 61.7% 


• | Load Following Units’ operating costs are generally higher per unit of output than for base load units due to the use of higher-cost fuels such as oil, natural gas and, in some cases, coal or lower overall unit efficiency. These units usually have more flexible operating characteristics than base load units which enable them to more easily follow fluctuations in load. They operate less frequently than base load units and derive revenues from energy, capacity and ancillary services.


• | Peaking Units run the least amount of time and in some cases may utilize higher-priced fuels. These units typically start very quickly in response to system needs. Costs per unit of output tend to be higher than for base load units given the combination of higher heat rates and fuel costs. The majority of revenues are from capacity and ancillary service sales. The characteristics of these units enable them to capture energy revenues during periods of high energy prices.

In the energy markets in which we operate, owners of power plants specify to the ISO prices at which they are prepared to generate and sell energy based on the marginal cost of generating energy from each individual unit. The ISOs will generally dispatch in merit order, calling on the lowest variable cost units first and dispatching progressively higher-cost units until the point that the entire system demand for power (known as the system “load”) is satisfied reliably. Base load units are dispatched first, with load following units next, followed by peaking units. It should be noted that the sustained lower pricing of natural gas over the past several years has resulted in changes in relative operating costs compared to historical norms, wherein some gas-fired generation is now able to displace some coal-fired generation. This change, combined with the addition of new, more efficient generation capacity, has altered the historical dispatch order of certain plants in the markets where we operate.
During periods when one or more parts of the transmission grid are operating at full capability, thereby resulting in a constraint on the transmission system, it may not be possible to dispatch units in merit order without violating transmission reliability standards. Under such circumstances, the ISO may dispatch higher-cost generation out of merit order within the congested area and power suppliers will be paid an increased Locational Marginal Price (LMP) in congested areas, reflecting the bid prices of those higher-cost generation units.
Typically, the bid price of the last unit dispatched by an ISO establishes the energy market-clearing price. After considering the market-clearing price and the effect of transmission congestion and other factors, the ISO calculates the LMP for every location in the system. The ISO pays all units that are dispatched their respective LMP for each MWh of energy produced, regardless of their specific bid prices. Since bids generally approximate the marginal cost of production, units with lower marginal costs typically generate higher operating profits than units with comparatively higher marginal costs.
This method of determining supply and pricing creates a situation where natural gas prices often have a major influence on the price that generators will receive for their output, especially in periods of relatively strong or weak demand. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas will often translate into changes in the wholesale price of electricity. This can be seen in the following graphs which present historical annual spot prices and forward calendar prices as averaged over each year at two liquid trading hubs. 
8

Historical data implies that the price of natural gas will continue to have a strong influence on the price of electricity in the primary markets in which we operate.
The prices reflected in the preceding graphs above do not necessarily illustrate our contract prices, but they are representative of market prices at relatively liquid hubs, with nearer-term forward pricing generally resulting from more liquid markets than pricing for later years. As shown above, prices may vary by location resulting from congestion or other factors, such as the availability of natural gas from the Marcellus (Leidy) and other shale-gas regions These variations can be considerable. Concurrent with the development of regional shale gas, we have been increasing our purchases from the Marcellus/Utica shale gas regions and in 2016 they accounted for approximately 90% of the gas we procured. While these prices provide some perspective on past and future prices, the forward prices are volatile and there can be no assurance that such prices will remain in effect or that we will be able to contract output at these forward prices.
Fuel Supply

• | Nuclear Fuel Supply—We have long-term contracts for nuclear fuel. These contracts provide for:


• | purchase of uranium (concentrates and uranium hexafluoride),


• | conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride,


• | enrichment of uranium hexafluoride, and


• | fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies.

Our nuclear fuel contracts cover approximately 100% of our estimated uranium, enrichment and fabrication requirements through 2018 and a significant portion through 2021.
9


• | Coal Supply—Our Keystone, Conemaugh and Bridgeport stations operate on coal. Coal is delivered to our units through a combination of rail, truck, barge and ocean shipments.

In order to control emissions levels, our Bridgeport 3 unit uses a specific type of coal obtained from Indonesia. We currently have a coal supply contract from Indonesia under contract through 2017 for the Bridgeport facility and believe that additional coal would be available after 2017 as required. 

• | Gas Supply—Natural gas is the primary fuel for the bulk of our load following and peaking fleet. We purchase gas directly from natural gas producers and marketers. These supplies are transported to New Jersey by four interstate pipelines with which we have contracted. In addition, we have firm gas transportation contracted for this winter season to serve a portion of the gas requirements for our BEC station in New York.

We have 1.3 billion cubic feet-per-day of firm transportation capacity and 0.9 billion cubic feet-per-day of firm storage delivery under contract to meet our obligations under the BGSS contract. This volume includes capacity from the Pennsylvania and Ohio shale gas regions where we purchase the majority of our natural gas. On an as-available basis, this firm transportation capacity may also be used to serve the gas supply needs of our generation fleet. 
Power has contracted for approximately 125 million cubic feet-per-day of delivery capability on the PennEast Pipeline from eastern Pennsylvania to New Jersey with a targeted in-service date in the latter half of 2018. This additional delivery capability will be used to supplement the BGSS contract. 

• | Oil—Oil is used as the primary fuel for one load following steam unit and four combustion turbine peaking units and can be used as an alternate fuel by several load following and peaking units that have dual-fuel capability. Oil for operations is drawn from on-site storage and is generally purchased on the spot market and delivered by truck or barge.

We expect to be able to meet the fuel supply demands of our customers and our own operations. However, the ability to maintain an adequate fuel supply could be affected by several factors not within our control, including changes in prices and demand, curtailments by suppliers, severe weather, environmental regulations, and other factors. For additional information, see Item 7. MD&A—Executive Overview of 2016 and Future Outlook and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.
Markets and Market Pricing 
The vast majority of Power’s generation assets are located in three centralized, competitive electricity markets operated by ISO organizations all of which are subject to the regulatory oversight of FERC: 

• | PJM Regional Transmission Organization—PJM conducts the largest centrally dispatched energy market in North America. It serves over 61 million people, nearly 19% of the total United States population, and has a record peak demand of 165,492 MW. The PJM Interconnection coordinates the movement of electricity through all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. The majority of our generating stations operate in PJM.


• | New York—The New York ISO (NYISO) is the market coordinator for New York State and is responsible for managing the New York Power Pool and for administering its energy marketplace. This service area has a population of about 19 million and a record peak demand of 33,956 MW. Our BEC station operates in New York.


• | New England—The ISO-New England (ISO-NE) is the market coordinator for the New England Power Pool and for administering its energy marketplace which covers Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. This service area has a population of about 15 million and a record peak demand of 28,130 MW. Our Bridgeport and New Haven stations operate in Connecticut.

The price of electricity varies by location in each of these markets. Depending upon our production and our obligations, these price differentials may increase or decrease our profitability.
Commodity prices, such as electricity, gas, coal, oil and environmental products, as well as the availability of our diverse fleet of generation units to operate, also have a considerable effect on our profitability. Over the long-term, the higher the forward prices are, the more attractive an environment exists for us to contract for the sale of our anticipated output. However, higher prices also increase the cost of replacement power; thereby placing us at greater risk should our generating units fail to operate effectively or otherwise become unavailable.
Over the past few years, lower wholesale natural gas prices have resulted in lower electric energy prices. One of the reasons for the lower natural gas prices is greater supply from more recently-developed sources, such as shale gas, much of which is 
10

produced in adjacent states (e.g. Pennsylvania). This trend has reduced margin on forward sales as we re-contract our expected generation output.
In addition to energy sales, we earn revenue from capacity payments for our generating assets. These payments are compensation for committing our generating units to the ISO for dispatch at its discretion. Capacity payments reflect the value to the ISO of assurance that there will be sufficient generating capacity available at all times to meet system reliability and energy requirements. Currently, there is sufficient capacity in the markets in which we operate. However, in certain areas of these markets there are transmission system transfer limitations which raise concerns about reliability and create a more acute need for capacity.
In PJM and ISO-NE, where we operate most of our generation, the market design for capacity payments provides for a structured, forward-looking, transparent capacity pricing mechanism. This is through the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) in PJM and the Forward Capacity Market (FCM) in ISO-NE. These mechanisms provide greater transparency regarding the value of capacity and provide a pricing signal to prospective investors in new generating facilities so as to encourage expansion of capacity to meet future market demands.
The prices to be received by generating units in PJM for capacity have been set through RPM base residual and incremental auctions and depend upon the zone in which the generating unit is located. For each delivery year, the prices differ in the various areas of PJM, depending on the transfer limitations of the transmission system in each area. Keystone and Conemaugh receive lower capacity prices than the majority of our PJM generating units since there are fewer constraints in that region and our generating units in New Jersey usually receive higher pricing.
Our PJM generating units are located in several zones and Power expects to realize the following average capacity prices from the base and incremental auctions which have been completed:
 
Delivery Year | MW-day
June 2016 to May 2017 | $172 
June 2017 to May 2018 | $177 
June 2018 to May 2019 | $215 
June 2019 to May 2020 | $116 

The price that must be paid by an entity serving load in the various zones is also set through these auctions. These prices can be higher or lower than the prices noted in the table above due to import and export capability to and from lower-priced areas. Prices in the most recent auction reflect PJM’s downwardly-revised demand forecast, changes in the emergency transfer limits due to transmission expansion and the effects of both the new generation and uncleared generation from the prior year’s auction.
We have obtained price certainty for our PJM capacity through May 2020 and New England capacity through May 2021 through the RPM and FCM pricing mechanisms, respectively.
Like PJM and ISO-NE, the NYISO provides capacity payments to its generating units, but unlike the other two markets, the New York market does not provide a forward price signal beyond a six month auction period.
On a prospective basis, many factors may affect the capacity pricing, including but not limited to:

• | load and demand,


• | availability of generating capacity (including retirements, additions, derates and forced outage rates),


• | capacity imports from external regions,


• | transmission capability between zones,


• | available amounts of demand response resources,


• | pricing mechanisms, including potentially increasing the number of zones to create more pricing sensitivity to changes in supply and demand, as well as other potential changes that PJM and the other ISOs may propose over time, and 


• | legislative and/or regulatory actions that permit subsidized local electric power generation.

For additional information on the RPM and FCM markets, as well as on state subsidization through various mechanisms, see Regulatory Issues—Federal Regulation.

Hedging Strategy
To mitigate volatility in our results, we seek to contract in advance for a significant portion of our anticipated electric output, capacity and fuel needs. We seek to sell a portion of our anticipated lower-cost generation over a multi-year forward horizon, normally over a period of two to three years. We believe this hedging strategy increases stability of earnings.
Among the ways in which we hedge our output are: (1) sales at PJM West and (2) BGS and similar full-requirements contracts. Sales at PJM West reflect block energy sales at the liquid PJM Western Hub and other transactions that seek to secure price certainty for our generation related products. The BGS-RSCP contract, a full-requirements contract that includes energy and capacity, ancillary and other services, is awarded for three-year periods through an auction process managed by the BPU. The volume of BGS contracts and the mix of electric utilities that our generation operations serve will vary from year to year. Pricing for the BGS contracts, including a capacity component, for recent and future periods by purchasing utility is as follows: 

Load Zone ($/MWh) | 2014-2017 | 2015-2018 | 2016-2019 | 2017-2020
PSE&G | $97.39 | $99.54 | $96.38 | $90.78 
Jersey Central Power & Light Company (JCP&L) | $84.44 | $80.42 | $74.85 | $69.08 
Atlantic City Electric Company | $87.80 | $86.06 | $82.14 | $75.49 
Rockland Electric Company | $95.61 | $90.66 | $85.02 | $80.50 

Although we enter into these hedges in an effort to provide price certainty for a large portion of our anticipated generation, there is variability in both our actual output as well as in the effectiveness of our hedges. Actual output will vary based upon total market demand, the relative cost position of our units compared to other units in the market and the operational flexibility of our units. Hedge volume can also vary, depending on the type of hedge into which we have entered. The BGS auction, for example, results in a contract that provides for the supplier to serve a percentage of the default load of a New Jersey EDC, that is, the load that remains after some customers have chosen to be served directly either by third-party suppliers or through municipal aggregation. The amount of power supplied through the BGS auction varies based on the level of the EDC’s default load, which is affected by the number of customers who are served by third-party suppliers, as well as by other factors such as weather and the economy. 
In recent years, as market prices declined from previous levels, there was an incentive for more of the smaller commercial and industrial electric customers to switch to third-party suppliers. In a falling price environment, this has a negative impact on our margins, as the anticipated BGS pricing is replaced by lower spot market pricing. As average BGS rates have declined to a level that more closely resembles current market prices, customers may see less of an incentive to switch to third-party suppliers. We are unable to determine the degree to which this switching, or “migration,” will continue, but the impact on our results could be material should market prices fall or rise significantly. 
In 2016, Power announced its intention to develop a retail energy platform to sell physical electricity and natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. We believe a retail energy platform would complement our existing wholesale generation-to-load marketing business and is intended to hedge our generation at improved margins in the geographic areas where we have generation facilities. Power was granted licenses in 2016 to sell both electricity and gas in the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania and expects to begin its marketing efforts in 2017.
As of February 9, 2017, we had contracted for the following percentages of our anticipated base load generation output for the next three years with modest amounts beyond 2019.
 
Base Load Generation | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 
Generation Sales | 100% | 80%-85% | 35%-40%

In a changing market environment, this hedging strategy may cause our realized prices to differ materially from current market prices. In a rising price environment, this strategy normally results in lower margins than would have been the case had no hedging activity been conducted. Alternatively, in a falling price environment, this hedging strategy will tend to create margins higher than those implied by the then-current market.
Our fuel strategy is to maintain certain levels of uranium in inventory and to make periodic purchases to support such levels. Our nuclear fuel commitments cover approximately 100% of our estimated uranium, enrichment and fabrication requirements through 2018 and a significant portion through 2021. We also have various long-term fuel purchase commitments for coal to support our Keystone, Conemaugh and Bridgeport Harbor stations. These purchase obligations are consistent with our strategy in general to enter into contracts for our fuel supply in comparable volumes to our sales contracts.
12

We take a more opportunistic approach in hedging both the fuel for and the anticipated output of our natural gas-fired generation. The generation from these units is less predictable, as a significant portion of these units will only dispatch when aggregate market demand has exceeded the supply provided by lower-cost units. Additionally, the recent development of low-cost gas supplies in the Marcellus region presents opportunities during certain portions of the year to procure gas for our generating units at attractive prices.
More than half of Power’s expected gross margin in the upcoming year relates to our hedging strategy, our expected revenues from the capacity market mechanisms described above and certain ancillary service payments such as reactive power.

Energy Holdings primarily owns and manages a portfolio of domestic lease investments. The majority of Energy Holdings’ $649 million of domestic lease investments are primarily energy-related leveraged leases. As of December 31, 2016, the counterparties for 66% of our total leveraged lease investments were rated below investment grade by Standard & Poor’s (S&P). See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 8. Financing Receivables for additional information.
Energy Holdings’ leveraged leasing portfolio is designed to provide a fixed rate of return. Leveraged lease investments involve three parties: an owner/lessor, a creditor and a lessee. In a typical leveraged lease financing, the lessor purchases an asset to be leased. The purchase price is typically financed 80% with debt provided by the creditor and the balance comes from equity funds provided by the lessor. The creditor provides long-term financing to the transaction secured by the property subject to the lease. Such long-term financing is non-recourse to the lessor and, with respect to our lease investments, is not presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The lessor acquires economic and tax ownership of the asset and then leases it to the lessee for a period of time no greater than 80% of its remaining useful life. As the owner, the lessor is entitled to depreciate the asset under applicable federal and state tax guidelines. The lessor receives income from lease payments made by the lessee during the term of the lease and from tax benefits associated with interest and depreciation deductions with respect to the leased property. Our ability to realize these tax benefits is dependent on operating gains generated by our other operating subsidiaries and allocated pursuant to the consolidated tax sharing agreement between us and our operating subsidiaries.
Lease rental payments are unconditional obligations of the lessee and are set at levels at least sufficient to service the non-recourse lease debt. The lessor is also entitled to any residual value associated with the leased asset at the end of the lease term. An evaluation of the after-tax cash flows to the lessor determines the return on the investment. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), the leveraged lease investment is recorded net of non-recourse debt and income is recognized as a constant return on the net unrecovered investment.
For additional information on leases, including the credit, tax and accounting risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Credit Risk, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 8. Financing Receivables.
In accordance with a twelve year Amended and Restated Operations Services Agreement (OSA) entered into by PSEG LI and the LIPA, PSEG LI commenced operating LIPA’s electric T&D system in Long Island, New York on January 1, 2014. As required by the OSA, PSEG LI also provides certain administrative support functions to LIPA. PSEG LI uses its brand in the Long Island T&D service area. Pursuant to the OSA, PSEG LI acts as LIPA’s agent in performing many of its obligations and in return (a) receives reimbursement for pass-through operating expenditures, (b) receives a fixed management fee and (c) is eligible to receive an incentive fee contingent on meeting established performance metrics. In addition, there is the opportunity for the parties to extend the contract for an additional eight years subject to the achievement by PSEG LI of certain performance levels during the initial term of the OSA. Also, as of January 2015, Power began providing fuel procurement and power management services to LIPA under separate agreements. 
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT
PSE&G
Our transmission and distribution business is minimally impacted when customers choose alternate electric or gas suppliers since we earn our return by providing transmission and distribution service, not by supplying the commodity. Increased reliance by customers on net-metered generation, including solar, and changes in customer behaviors can result in decreased reliance on our system and impact our revenues and investment opportunities. The demand for electric energy and gas by customers is affected by customer conservation, economic conditions, weather and other factors not within our control.
Changes in the current policies for building new transmission lines, such as those ordered by FERC and being implemented by PJM and other ISOs to eliminate contractual provisions that previously provided us a “right of first refusal” (ROFR) to construct projects in our service territory, could result in third-party construction of transmission lines in our area in the future 
13

and also allow us to seek opportunities to build in other service territories. These implementing rules within the regions are still in flux so both the extent of the risk within our service territory and the opportunities for our transmission business elsewhere remain difficult to assess. For additional information, see the discussion in Regulatory Issues—Federal Regulation—Transmission Regulation, below.
Construction of new local generation and changing customer usage patterns also have the potential to reduce the need for the construction of new transmission to transport remote generation and alleviate system constraints.
Power
Various market participants compete with us and one another in buying and selling in the wholesale energy markets, entering into bilateral contracts and selling to aggregated retail customers. Our competitors include:

• | merchant generators,


• | domestic and multi-national utility generators,


• | energy marketers,


• | banks, funds and other financial entities,


• | fuel supply companies, and


• | affiliates of other industrial companies.

New additions of lower-cost or more efficient generation capacity could make our plants less economic in the future. Although it is not clear if this capacity will be built or, if so, what the economic impact will be, such additions would impact market prices and our competitiveness.
Our business is also under competitive pressure due to demand side management (DSM) and other efficiency efforts aimed at changing the quantity and patterns of usage by consumers which could result in a reduction in load requirements. A reduction in load requirements can also be caused by economic cycles, weather, municipal aggregation and other customer migration and other factors. In addition, how resources such as demand response and capacity imports are permitted to bid into the capacity markets also affects the prices paid to generators such as Power in these markets. It is also possible that advances in technology, such as distributed generation and micro grids, will reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing electricity to a level that is competitive with that of most central station electric production. To the extent that additions to the electric transmission system relieve or reduce limitations and constraints in eastern PJM where most of our plants are located, our revenues could be adversely affected. Changes in the rules governing what types of transmission will be built, who is selected to build transmission and who will pay the costs of future transmission could also impact our generation revenues.
Adverse changes in energy industry law, policies and regulation, including market structures and a potential shift away from competitive markets toward subsidized market mechanisms, would have the effect of artificially depressing prices in the competitive wholesale market and thus have the potential to harm competitive markets, on both a short-term and a long-term basis. At the same time, changes implemented in the PJM and New England capacity markets and other proposed market changes discussed more fully in Regulatory Issues—Federal Regulation provide the opportunity for additional compensation in both the energy and capacity markets.
Environmental issues, such as restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutants, may also have a competitive impact on us to the extent that it becomes more expensive for some of our plants to remain compliant, thus affecting our ability to be a lower-cost provider compared to competitors without such restrictions. In addition, most of our plants, which are located in the Northeast where rules are more stringent, can be at an economic disadvantage compared to our competitors in certain Midwest states. 
While it is our expectation that efforts may be undertaken by the new administration, following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, to preserve the existing base of fossil generating plants, we still believe that pressures from renewable resources will continue to increase. For example, many parts of the country, including the mid-western region served by the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO), the PJM region and the California ISO, have either implemented or proposed implementing changes to their respective regional transmission planning processes that may enable the construction of large amounts of “public policy” transmission to move renewable generation to load centers. For additional information, see the discussion in Regulatory Issues—Federal Regulation.

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS
As of December 31, 2016, we had 13,065 employees within our subsidiaries, including 8,161 covered under collective bargaining agreements. Since the beginning of 2016, six of our eight labor unions ratified extensions of their collective bargaining agreements with us, with expiration dates from 2019 to 2021. The collective bargaining agreements for the remaining two unions expire in June 2017 and May 2018. We believe we maintain satisfactory relationships with our employees.

REGULATORY ISSUES 
In the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to regulation by, and are party to various claims and regulatory proceedings with, FERC, the BPU, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and various state and federal environmental regulators, among others. For information regarding material matters, other than those discussed below, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.
Federal Regulation
FERC
FERC is an independent federal agency that regulates the transmission of electric energy and gas in interstate commerce and the sale of electric energy and gas at wholesale pursuant to the Federal Power Act (FPA) and the Natural Gas Act. PSE&G and the generation and energy trading subsidiaries of Power are public utilities as defined by the FPA. FERC has extensive oversight over such public utilities. FERC approval is usually required when a public utility seeks to: sell or acquire an asset that is regulated by FERC (such as a transmission line or a generating station); collect costs from customers associated with a new transmission facility; charge a rate for wholesale sales under a contract or tariff; or engage in certain mergers and internal corporate reorganizations. As a result of the change in administration following the U.S. presidential election, FERC does not currently have the quorum required to issue certain substantive orders. Until quorum is obtained, FERC Staff has been delegated authority, which allows FERC to continue carrying out its regulatory obligations in the absence of a quorum of Commissioners. The FERC order delegated to FERC Staff the ability to take certain actions to avoid filings going into effect by operation of law until FERC again has a quorum and moves to lift the delegation order.
FERC also regulates generating facilities known as qualifying facilities (QFs). QFs are cogeneration facilities that produce electricity and another form of useful thermal energy, or small power production facilities where the primary energy source is renewable, biomass, waste or geothermal resources. QFs must meet certain criteria established by FERC. We own various QFs through Power. QFs are subject to some, but not all, of the same FERC requirements as public utilities.
FERC also regulates Regional Transmission Operators (RTOs)/ISOs, such as PJM, and their energy and capacity markets.
For us, the major effects of FERC regulation fall into five general categories:

• | Regulation of Wholesale Sales—Generation/Market Issues/Market Power


• | Energy Clearing Prices


• | Capacity Market Issues


• | Transmission Regulation


• | Compliance

Regulation of Wholesale Sales—Generation/Market Issues/Market Power
Under FERC regulations, public utilities that wish to sell power at market rates must receive FERC authorization (“MBR Authority”) to sell power in interstate commerce before making power sales. They can sell power at cost-based rates or apply to FERC for authority to make market-based rate (MBR) sales. For a requesting company to receive MBR Authority, FERC must 
15

first make a determination that the requesting company lacks market power in the relevant markets and/or that market power in the relevant markets is sufficiently mitigated. The following PSEG companies are public utilities and currently have MBR Authority: PSE&G, PSEG ER&T, PSEG Fossil, PSEG Nuclear, PSEG Power Connecticut, PSEG New Haven, PSEG Energy Solutions, Pavant Solar II LLC, San Isabel Solar LLC and Bison Solar LLC. FERC requires that holders of MBR Authority file an update every three years demonstrating that they continue to lack market power and/or that their market power has been sufficiently mitigated and report in the interim to FERC any material change in facts from those FERC relied on in granting MBR Authority.  
In December 2016, the PSEG companies with MBR Authority filed their triennial market power analysis as required by FERC regulations. A FERC order on the PSEG companies’ triennial filing is expected in the third quarter 2017.
Energy Clearing Prices
Energy clearing prices in the markets in which we operate are generally based on bids submitted by generating units. Under FERC-approved market rules, bids are subject to price caps and mitigation rules applicable to certain generation units. FERC rules also govern the overall design of these markets. At present, all units within a delivery zone receive a clearing price based on the bid of the marginal unit (i.e. the last unit that must be dispatched to serve the needs of load) which can vary by location. In addition, recent rule changes in the energy markets administered by PJM and ISO-NE (see Capacity Market Issues below) impose rigorous performance obligations and nonperformance penalties on resources during times of system stress. These FERC rules have a direct impact on the prices received by our units.
FERC has also recently ordered certain favorable changes to energy market price formation rules improving shortage pricing and enhancing bidding flexibility for units. We continue to advocate in this context for additional changes in market rules that would provide more transparency about energy market prices. We cannot predict what action FERC might ultimately take, but such an examination could lead to future rule changes. 
Capacity Market Issues
PJM, NYISO and ISO-NE each have capacity markets that have been approved by FERC. FERC regulates these markets and continues to examine whether the market design for each of these three capacity markets is working optimally. Issues presented in various forums include consideration of whether capacity market rules properly address and foster the development of state public policies, demand response (DR) and emerging technologies, whether generators are being sufficiently compensated in the capacity market and whether subsidized resources may be adversely affecting capacity market outcomes. We cannot predict what action, if any, FERC might take with regard to capacity market design.
PJM—The RPM is the locational installed capacity market design for the PJM region, including a forward auction for installed capacity. Under the RPM, generators located in constrained areas within PJM are paid more for their capacity as an incentive to ensure adequate supply where generation capacity is most needed. The mechanics of the RPM in PJM continue to evolve and be refined in stakeholder proceedings and FERC proceedings in which we are active. 
During 2015, PJM implemented a new “Capacity Performance” (CP) mechanism that created a more robust capacity product definition with enhanced incentives for performance during emergency conditions and significant penalties for non-performance. However, aspects of FERC’s order are currently pending appeal in the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit). The CP product will be implemented fully for the 2020-2021 Delivery Year. Based upon the August 2015 base residual auction results, the CP mechanism appears to have provided the opportunity for enhanced capacity market revenue streams for Power but future impacts cannot be assured. Efforts to modify the CP construct to enhance the participation of intermittent and DR resources (“seasonal resources”) are currently pending before FERC. PJM has proposed modifications to the aggregation rules to improve the ability of seasonal resources to participate and two complaints have been filed requesting that FERC investigate the rules governing the participation of seasonal resources and extend the participation of the base resources for future auctions. We expect either FERC action on PJM’s proposal or inaction in the event that it goes into effect by operation of law before the upcoming base residual auction in May 2017. If PJM’s proposal goes into effect by operation of law, there could be an increase in the participation of seasonal resources in the auction.
In September 2014, PJM filed at FERC to re-set the Variable Resource Requirement (VRR) curve for the RPM. PJM expects to reset the VRR every four years. Establishment of the VRR curve is a critical component in determining how generators are paid in the capacity auction. In November 2014, FERC accepted PJM’s filing, which we believe represents an improvement over the status quo in terms of appropriately setting the demand curve. However, we and a trade association composed of other generators have challenged FERC’s approval order on appeal at the D.C. Circuit, taking exception to FERC’s approval of the manner in which PJM calculated the cost of capital and labor costs that form the basis for the Cost of New Entry component of the demand curve, which we believe have been set too low and do not accurately reflect the costs of building a new generating unit in PJM. 
16

Over the past several years, certain entities in PJM, namely, FirstEnergy Corp. (FE) and American Electric Power (AEP) sought financial support arrangements from the Ohio Public Utility Commission (PUCO) for certain coal plants and, for FE, a nuclear plant. FE and AEP originally proposed to enter into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with their non-utility generation affiliates providing for above-market purchases from these plants. The PUCO Staff proposed a payment to support modernization of the distribution system (distribution modernization rider) in the FE case which was ultimately accepted by the PUCO. The Dayton Power and Light Company also recently filed for a distribution modernization rider for the generating plants that it owns.  
The PUCO proceedings created a concern that subsidized units within the PJM footprint would submit bids in the capacity market that are not reflective of their actual operating costs and would, in turn, artificially suppress capacity prices. As a result, certain parties requested that FERC should direct PJM to expand the “minimum offer price rule” to apply to existing units.  
We are unable to predict the results of these pending proceedings or any future related proceedings or to calculate the potential impacts on our business.
MISO—MISO does not have a mandatory capacity market in place, as load serving entities may submit Fixed Resource Adequacy Plans in lieu of participating in the capacity auction. Significant quantities of capacity from MISO are imported into PJM which tends to have a downward effect on PJM capacity prices. However, recent enhancements to PJM market rules have tightened eligibility requirements for PJM imports and reduced these impacts. The issue of “capacity portability” from MISO continues to be examined in the stakeholder process.
ISO-NE—ISO-NE’s market for installed capacity in New England provides fixed capacity payments for generators, imports and DR. The market design consists of a forward-looking auction for installed capacity that is intended to recognize the locational value of resources on the system and contains incentive mechanisms to encourage availability during stressed system conditions. ISO-NE also employs a mechanism, similar to PJM’s CP mechanism, that provides incentives for performance and that imposes charges for non-performance during times of system stress. We view this mechanism as generally positive for generating resources as providing more robust income streams. However, it also imposes additional financial risk for non-performance. One aspect of the current market design that we do not support is the exemption from the MOPR in the capacity market afforded for up to 200 MW annually (600 MW cumulatively) of renewable resources. FERC has approved downward sloping demand curves and zonal curves for the three designated capacity zones for Forward Capacity Auction (FCA) 11. In addition, ISO-NE’s review of the Net Cost of New Entry (Net CONE) was recently submitted at FERC which would be implemented for FCA 12. If approved by FERC, the value of Net CONE will be reduced which could impact the revenues we expect to receive for our generation in the New England capacity market. 
NYISO—NYISO operates a short-term capacity market that provides a forward price signal only for six months into the future. Various matters pending before FERC could affect the competitiveness of this market and the outcome of these proceedings could result in artificial price suppression unless sufficient market protections are adopted. 
One capacity market matter pending before FERC involves rules to govern payments and bidding requirements for generators proposing to exit the market but required to remain in service for reliability reasons. In March 2015, FERC issued an order which held that units receiving special reliability payments could properly take those payments into account in formulating capacity market bids. We believe that this ruling could impact efficient price formation in the capacity market and could artificially suppress capacity market outcomes. In April 2015, a trade association, Independent Power Producers of New York, Inc. (IPPNY) of which Power is a member, filed for rehearing by FERC of this ruling. This rehearing is still pending. Also, in connection with this same proceeding, FERC required NYISO to submit a report addressing whether buyer-side mitigation measures are needed for new entry occurring in the “Rest of State” (ROS) region and for uneconomic retention and repowering anywhere in the state. NYISO filed a report with FERC in December 2015 contending that these measures are not needed. The IPPNY has opposed NYISO’s contentions. The matter remains pending before FERC. In addition, in May 2015, the New York Public Service Commission and other New York agencies filed a complaint at FERC requesting certain exemptions from the NYISO rules that prevent capacity suppliers from submitting bids that are not market competitive. On October 9, 2015, FERC granted in part, certain of the requested exemptions for renewable resources and for resources being used by the owner for self-supply. The IPPNY has challenged NYISO’s proposed implementation of the newly required exemptions. This challenge is still pending. 
NYISO’s capacity market incorporates demand curves that are determined periodically by NYISO and approved by FERC. In November 2016, NYISO submitted to FERC for approval proposed demand curves that updated key parameters. The updated demand curves reflect the expected cost of new entry of peaking plants in New York and in each of the three capacity localities. If approved, this could impact the revenues we expect to receive for our generation in the New York capacity market. FERC issued an order substantially accepting NYISO’s proposed demand curves, but did not accept the proposal that the ROS proxy peaking unit design include selective catalytic reduction (SCR) emissions control technology.

Price Formation Initiatives
Power has been actively involved both through stakeholder processes and through filings at FERC in seeking improvements to the rules for setting prices for energy in the day-ahead and real-time markets administered by PJM and other system operators. FERC recently issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) proposing that RTOs/ISOs modify their rules governing fast-start resources. Fast-start resources typically are committed in real-time, very close to the interval when needed and can respond quickly to unforeseen system needs. However, without fast-start pricing, some fast-start resources are ineligible to set prices due to inflexible operating limits. As a result, prices may not reflect the marginal cost of serving load. In a separate proceeding, PJM has submitted a proposal at FERC’s request to modify its rules to allow market sellers to submit day-ahead offers that vary by hour and to allow market sellers to update their offers in real time on an hourly basis under certain circumstances. These rule changes are currently pending before FERC. If both changes are approved, we believe that they would improve price formation in the energy and ancillary services markets. 
Transmission Regulation
FERC has exclusive jurisdiction to establish the rates and terms and conditions of service for interstate transmission. We currently have FERC-approved formula rates in effect to recover the costs of our transmission facilities. Under this formula, rates are put into effect in January of each year based upon our internal forecast of annual expenses and capital expenditures. Rates are subsequently trued up to reflect actual annual expenses and capital expenditures. Our allowed ROE is 11.68% for both existing and new transmission investments and we have received incentive rates, affording a higher ROE, for certain large scale transmission investments. 
In October 2016, PSE&G filed its 2017 Annual Formula Rate Update with FERC which requests approximately $121 million in increased annual transmission revenues effective January 1, 2017, subject to true-up. Each year, transmission revenues are adjusted to reflect items such as updating estimates used in the filing with actual data. For additional information about our transmission formula rate, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities.
Transmission Policy Developments—FERC concluded in Order 1000 that the incumbent transmission owner should not always have a ROFR to construct and own transmission projects in its service territory. We and other companies appealed Order 1000 but this appeal was denied in 2014 by the D.C. Court. The current PJM rules retain carve-outs for projects that will continue to default to incumbents for construction responsibility, including immediately needed reliability projects, upgrades to existing transmission facilities, projects cost-allocated to a single transmission zone, and projects being built on existing rights-of-way and whose construction would interfere with incumbents’ use of their rights-of-way. 
In a September 2015 order, FERC directed that a technical conference be held to address “concerns regarding how PJM plans for local transmission projects.” Parties in the case raised concerns that too many projects are being approved outside of the Regional Transmission Expansion Plan (RTEP) mechanism to address “local” reliability requirements without going through the Order 1000 open window process. Intervenors also complained that there is inadequate transparency regarding the PJM transmission owners’ consideration and selection of Supplemental Projects (which are not approved by the PJM Board). PSE&G is participating in the process before FERC in support of the current PJM processes. In addition, certain PJM stakeholders have proposed an examination of the current planning rules, including changes with regard to criteria to be used for replacement of facilities that have reached their “end of life.” PSE&G has been actively participating in this process. However, we are unable to predict the outcome of these efforts.
In a February 2016 order, FERC reversed a previous order and accepted a filing by the PJM transmission owners seeking authority to assign costs for RTEP projects (subject to PJM Board approval requirements) solely addressing localized needs to customers within the local transmission owner’s zone. FERC’s action in this order provides an exemption from the Order 1000 open window procedures for projects constructed by transmission owners to meet local transmission planning criteria. In April 2016, PJM filed at FERC to incorporate a voltage threshold into PJM’s RTEP process to exempt, except under certain circumstances, reliability violations on facilities below 200 kV from PJM’s proposal window process. We generally support this reform as a measure to improve the efficiency of the open window procedure that will permit transmission developers to focus on the projects most likely to benefit from a competitive process.
There are several matters pending before FERC that concern the allocation of costs associated with transmission projects being constructed by PSE&G contending that insufficient levels of costs are being allocated to customers in the PSE&G transmission zone. Projects involved include the Artificial Island project, the Bergen-Linden project in New Jersey and a smaller project in Sewaren, New Jersey. In April 2016, FERC issued orders denying the complaints and leaving the current cost allocation in effect as to the Artificial Island and Bergen-Linden projects. Due to an intervening FERC order concerning the allocation of costs for projects constructed to meet local reliability requirements, FERC directed that all of the Sewaren costs be allocated to customers in the PSE&G transmission zone. It is anticipated that additional proceedings are likely to occur. 
18

In February 2016, FERC issued an order granting PSE&G’s request that it be permitted to seek recovery of 100% of its portion of the project’s costs to address identified high voltage issues at Artificial Island in New Jersey if the project is canceled for reasons beyond PSE&G’s control. In April 2016, PSE&G accepted construction responsibility for the three components of the project that PJM assigned to it, based on having reached agreement with PJM regarding an estimate for the project base cost of $273 million, plus risk and contingency for a total project cost of up to $340 million. In August 2016, PJM announced that it had suspended the Artificial Island transmission project and would be performing a comprehensive analysis to support a future course of action. PJM is expected to submit its final recommendation to the PJM Board at the April 2017 Board meeting. 
In June 2015, a transmission developer filed a complaint against PJM claiming that PJM wrongfully refused to provide data and a transparent process for evaluating transmission network upgrade requests that the transmission developer had submitted to PJM. According to the complaint, PJM and certain transmission owners wrongfully inflated the scope and associated costs of mitigation work needed to accommodate the developer’s proposal in order to prevent it from pursuing its projects. Although not named as a respondent in the complaint, PSE&G is identified as one of the companies claimed to have been involved. FERC set the complaint for hearing and settlement procedures and the parties are currently engaged in discovery. We are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings.
Another proceeding is a matter remanded from a federal appellate court concerning the appropriate cost allocation for certain 500 kV projects in PJM that either have been built or are in the process of being built, including the Susquehanna-Roseland project. A proposed settlement was filed with FERC in June 2016. The settlement, if adopted by FERC, would result in increased annual cost allocations to customers in the PSE&G transmission zone. Under this settlement, Power, as a BGS supplier could become obligated to pay amounts previously paid by other PJM transmission customers. However, we do not believe that the anticipated level of any such potential payments would have a material effect on Power’s financial statements. We believe that there is a mechanism in place under the BGS contract for the pass-through of increases in transmission charges.
Transmission Rate Proceedings—Several complaints have been filed and several remain pending at FERC against transmission owners around the country, challenging those transmission owners’ base ROEs. Certain of those complaints have resulted in decisions and others have been settled, resulting in reductions of those transmission owners’ base ROEs. While we are not the subject of a challenge to the ROE employed in PSE&G’s transmission formula rate, the results of these other proceedings could set precedents for other transmission owners with formula rates in place, including PSE&G. 
Con Edison Wheeling Agreement—In April 2016, Con Edison informed PJM that it would allow its Wheeling Agreement to expire effective as of May 1, 2017. The Wheeling Agreement enables Con Edison to move 1,000 MW of power from southeastern New York across the PSE&G system for delivery into New York City. NYISO and PJM submitted proposed tariff provisions in January 2017. The proposal concerns future operational procedures and transmission planning assumptions associated with the affected transmission lines. The manner in which PJM has calculated the import assumptions for the upcoming base residual auction has decreased the potential for locational splits in the zones where PSEG has its assets. However, PJM has indicated that it is still reviewing these import assumptions and may publish revised values before the auction. We cannot predict the impact of the proposal on energy prices or transmission planning at this time. Also, PSE&G will continue to recover the costs associated with the new arrangement through its formula rate. However, we continue to review the proposal and may protest certain of its elements. 
Compliance
FERC—For information about the preliminary non-public investigation initiated by the FERC Staff regarding errors in the calculation of certain components of Power’s cost-based bids for its New Jersey fossil generating units in the PJM energy market and the quantity of energy that Power offered into the energy market for its fossil peaking units compared to the amounts for which Power was compensated in the capacity market for those units, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.
Reliability Standards—Congress has required FERC to put in place, through the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), national and regional reliability standards to ensure the reliability of the U.S. electric transmission and generation system (grid) and to prevent major system blackouts. There has been considerable focus recently on physical security in light of, among other things, a substation attack in California that occurred in 2013. As a result, FERC directed the NERC to draft a physical security standard intended to further protect assets deemed “critical” to reliability of the grid. In November 2014, FERC issued an order approving the NERC’s proposed physical security standard. Under the standard, utilities will be required to identify critical substations as well as develop threat assessment plans to be reviewed by independent third parties. In our case, the third-party is PJM. As part of these plans, utilities could decide or be required to build additional redundancy into their systems. This standard will supplement the Critical Infrastructure Protection standards that are already in place and that establish physical and cybersecurity protections for critical systems. We are taking steps to meet the new obligations. FERC directed the NERC to develop a new reliability standard to provide security controls for supply chain management associated with the procurement of industrial control system hardware, software, and services related to bulk electric system operations. When adopted, compliance with these new standards would be expected to impose additional obligations and costs.

Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the SEC and the CFTC are in the process of implementing a new regulatory framework for swaps and security-based swaps. The legislation was enacted to reduce systemic risk, increase transparency and promote market integrity within the financial system by providing for the registration and comprehensive regulation of swap dealers and by imposing recordkeeping, data reporting, margin and clearing requirements with respect to swaps. To implement the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has engaged in a comprehensive rulemaking process and has issued a number of proposed and final rules addressing many of the key issues. We are currently subject to recordkeeping and data reporting requirements applicable to commercial end users. The CFTC has also re-proposed rules establishing position limits for trading in certain commodities, such as natural gas, and we will begin complying with these rules once they become final. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
Our operation of nuclear generating facilities is subject to comprehensive regulation by the NRC, a federal agency established to regulate nuclear activities to ensure protection of public health and safety, as well as the security and protection of the environment. Such regulation involves testing, evaluation and modification of all aspects of plant operation in light of NRC safety and environmental requirements. Continuous demonstration to the NRC that plant operations meet requirements is also necessary. The NRC has the ultimate authority to determine whether any nuclear generating unit may operate. The current operating licenses of our nuclear facilities expire in the years shown in the following table:

Unit | Year
Salem Unit 1 | 2036
Salem Unit 2 | 2040
Hope Creek | 2046
Peach Bottom Unit 2 | 2033
Peach Bottom Unit 3 | 2034

As a result of events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility in Japan following the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, the NRC began performing additional operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the United States. These reviews and the lessons learned from the events in Japan have resulted in additional regulation and implementation guidance for the nuclear industry and could impact future operations and capital requirements for our facilities. We believe that our nuclear plants currently meet the stringent applicable design and safety specifications of the NRC. 
We have implemented the diverse and flexible mitigating strategies and spent fuel pool level indication modifications in accordance with the regulatory requirements at the Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom nuclear units. For our Hope Creek and Peach Bottom units, implementation of the required venting system modifications is expected to be completed by 2018.
The NRC continues to evaluate potential revisions to its requirements in connection with its operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the United States as a result of the Fukushima Daiichi incident.
We are unable to predict the final outcome of these reviews or the cost of any actions we would need to take to comply with any new regulations, including possible modifications to our Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom facilities, but such cost could be material.
State Regulation
Since our operations are primarily located within New Jersey, our principal state regulator is the BPU, which oversees electric and natural gas distribution companies in New Jersey. We are also subject to various other states’ regulations due to our operations in those states. 
Our New Jersey utility operations are subject to comprehensive regulation by the BPU including, among other matters, regulation of retail electric and gas distribution rates and service, the issuance and sale of certain types of securities and compliance matters. PSE&G’s participation in solar, demand response and energy efficiency programs is also regulated by the BPU, as the terms and conditions of these programs are approved by the BPU. BPU regulation can also have a direct or indirect impact on our power generation business as it relates to energy supply agreements and energy policy in New Jersey.
We must file electric and gas rate cases with the BPU in order to change our utility base distribution rates. Our last base rate case was settled in 2010. As a result of our 2014 Energy Strong Order, we are required to file our next distribution base rate case proceeding no later than November 1, 2017. In addition to base rates, we recover certain costs or earn on certain investments pursuant to mechanisms known as adjustment clauses. These clauses permit the flow-through of costs to, or the 
20

recovery of investments from, customers related to specific programs, outside the context of base rate case proceedings. Recovery of these costs or investments is subject to BPU approval for which we make periodic filings. Delays in the pass-through of costs or recovery of investments under these mechanisms could result in significant changes in cash flow. For additional information on our specific filings, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities. 
Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP)—In November 2015, the BPU issued an order approving the settlement of our GSMP through which PSE&G will invest $905 million over the next three years to modernize its gas system. The settlement enables the utility to replace up to 510 miles of gas mains and 38,000 service lines over a three-year period, with cost recovery at a 9.75% rate of return on equity on $650 million of the investment through an accelerated recovery mechanism. Under the settlement, PSE&G will seek recovery of the remaining $255 million of investment in its next base rate case. In December 2016, the BPU approved PSE&G’s initial GSMP cost recovery petition which allows PSE&G to recover in base rates capitalized GSMP investment costs for infrastructure placed in service through September 30, 2016. The BPU order provides for a total $10 million annual revenue increase effective January 1, 2017.
BPU Cybersecurity Requirements for Regulated Entities—In March 2016, the BPU issued an order for the regulated electric, natural gas, and water/wastewater utilities to further reduce the potential for cyber threats to the reliability and resiliency of utility service and to protect customers’ information. The order requires these regulated utilities, including PSE&G, to, among other conditions, implement a cybersecurity program that defines and implements organization accountabilities and responsibilities for cyber risk management activities, and establishes policies, plans, processes and procedures for identifying and mitigating cyber risk to critical systems.  
In December 2016, PSE&G submitted a required letter to the BPU outlining its compliance efforts to date and noting that it currently has not identified any potential barriers to compliance with the order’s requirements. New Jersey utilities, including PSE&G, are required to be compliant with these requirements by October 1, 2017, taking various measures aimed to meet this compliance deadline. For a discussion of the risks associated with cyber threats, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
Solar 4 All Program Extension II—In November 2016, the BPU approved a settlement providing for an extension of PSE&G’s existing landfill/brownfield solar program to construct up to 33 MW of grid connected facilities with projected capital expenditures of approximately $80 million through May 2020. 
Consolidated Tax Adjustments (CTA)—New Jersey is one of only a few states that make CTA in setting rates for regulated utilities. These adjustments to rate base are made during the rate setting process and are intended to allocate to utility customers a portion of the tax benefits realized from the filing of a consolidated federal tax return by the utility’s parent corporation. The BPU has been considering the appropriateness of the adjustment and the methodology and mechanics of the calculation for some time. In October 2014, the BPU approved a proposal by its Staff that limits the tax benefit period to be considered in the calculation to five years, sets the rate base adjustment at 25% of any such tax benefit and eliminates from the process any tax benefits tied to transmission earnings. In accordance with this October action, this CTA policy will be applied only with respect to future rate cases. The adoption of these modifications by the BPU is not expected to have a material impact on PSE&G’s current earnings nor in its next rate case filing. In November 2014, the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel appealed the BPU’s decision which remains pending. 
Connecticut Rate Filing—In June 2016, Power’s subsidiary, PSEG New Haven LLC, filed a mandatory annual rate case with the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority for recovery of its costs and investment in its Connecticut-based peaking unit. Power requested 2017 revenues of $20 million, which was approved in its entirety. 
Additional matters are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations with regard to environmental matters including, but not limited to:

• | air pollution control,


• | climate change,


• | water pollution control,


• | hazardous substance liability, and


• | fuel and waste disposal.

21

We expect there will be changes to existing environmental laws and regulations, particularly in light of the change in administration following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which could significantly impact the manner in which our operations are currently conducted. Such laws and regulations may also affect the timing, cost, location, design, construction and operation of new facilities. Due to evolving environmental regulations, it is difficult to project future costs of compliance and their impact on competition. Capital costs of complying with known pollution control requirements are included in our estimate of construction expenditures in Item 7. MD&A—Capital Requirements. The costs of compliance associated with any new requirements that may be imposed by future regulations are not known, but may be material.
For additional information related to environmental matters, including proceedings not discussed below, as well as anticipated expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment, hazardous substance liabilities and fuel and waste disposal costs, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.
Air Pollution Control
Our facilities are subject to federal regulation under the Clean Air Act (CAA) which requires controls of emissions from sources of air pollution and imposes recordkeeping, reporting and permit requirements. Our facilities are also subject to requirements established under state and local air pollution laws. The CAA requires all major sources, such as our generation facilities, to obtain and keep current an operating permit. The costs of compliance associated with any new requirements that may be imposed and included in these permits in the future could be material and are not included in our estimates of capital expenditures.
Hazardous Air Pollutants Regulation—In February 2012, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published Mercury Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for both newly-built and existing electric generating sources under the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) provisions of the CAA. The MATS established allowable levels for mercury as well as other hazardous air pollutants and went into effect in April 2015. In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court held that it was unreasonable for the EPA to refuse to consider the materiality of costs in determining whether to regulate hazardous air pollutants from power plants. In April 2016, the EPA released the final Supplemental Finding that considers the materiality of costs in determining whether to regulate hazardous air pollutants from power plants in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling. Industry participants and various state authorities have filed petitions with the D.C. Court challenging the EPA’s Supplemental Finding. We do not expect this Supplemental Finding to impact operation of our facilities.
Demand Response (DR) Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines (RICE) Litigation—In March 2013, Power filed a petition at the EPA challenging the NESHAP for RICE issued in January 2013. Among other things, the NESHAP include two exemptions that allow owners and operators of stationery emergency RICE to operate their engines without the installation and operation of emission controls (1) as part of an emergency DR program for 100 hours per year (100 hour exemption) or (2) as part of a financial arrangement with another entity per specified restrictions in non-emergency situations for 50 hours per year (50 hour exemption). In its petition, Power sought more stringent emission control standards for RICE to support more competitive markets, particularly the PJM capacity market. In August 2014, the EPA denied the March 2013 petition and in October 2014, Power appealed the EPA’s denial to the D.C. Court. In September 2015, the D.C. Court granted the EPA’s motion for voluntary remand of the 50 hour exemption provision to the EPA. In May 2016, the D.C. Court vacated the 100 hour exemption which removes that provision from the rule. 
Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR)—In January 2015, the final CSAPR became effective which limits power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and annual and ozone season nitrogen oxide (NOx) in 28 states that contribute to the ability of downwind states to attain and/or maintain the 1997 and 2006 particulate matter and the 1997 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). In April 2015, the EPA revoked the 1997 ozone NAAQS of 80 parts per billion (ppb) and began implementation of the more stringent 2008 ozone NAAQS of 75 ppb. In September 2016, the EPA published the final CSAPR Updating Rule to address the 2008 National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ground-level ozone. The rule establishes more stringent annual ozone season (May 1 through September 30) caps beginning in May 2017. We do not anticipate any material impact on our business or financial condition due to the CSAPR. Numerous parties have filed petitions for review with the D.C. Court to challenge the CSAPR Updating Rule.
Ozone Standard—In December 2014, the EPA proposed a rule to lower the ambient air quality standard for the level of ozone in the atmosphere from 75 ppb to a level in the range of 65-70 ppb. On October 1, 2015, the EPA finalized a standard of 70 ppb. To meet the new standard, the EPA and the states have to implement additional emission reduction strategies for NOx and volatile organic compounds. Some portions of the Mid-Atlantic and New England states are not expected to be able to meet the new standard. Although the majority of our fossil generating units employ state-of-the-art NOx emission controls, we cannot predict the outcome of this matter since new requirements of the EPA and the states are unknown at this time. Numerous parties have filed petitions for review with the D.C. Court to challenge the rule.
22

Climate Change
CO2 Regulation under the CAA—In October 2015, the EPA published the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new power plants. The NSPS establishes two emission standards for CO2 for the following categories: (i) fossil fuel-fired utility boilers and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) units, and (ii) natural gas combustion turbines. Simple cycle combustion turbines are exempt from the rule.
In October 2015, the EPA published the Clean Power Plan (CPP), a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions regulation under the CAA for existing power plants. The regulation establishes state-specific emission rate targets based on implementation of the best system of emission reduction (BSER). The BSER consists of three components: (i) heat rate improvements at existing coal-fired power plants, (ii) increased use of existing natural gas combined cycle capacity, and (iii) operation of incremental zero-emitting generation (renewables and nuclear). States may choose these or other methodologies to achieve the necessary reductions of CO2 emissions. 
Numerous states, including New Jersey, and several industry groups filed petitions for review with the D.C. Court to challenge the CPP. In addition, the petitioners sought a stay of the rule. The U.S. Supreme Court stayed the rule pending further review of the case. 
The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to stay the implementation of the CPP will delay deadlines for submission of state requests for extensions and final plans. If the CPP is upheld, new deadlines will need to be established and the effective date of the compliance period may be impacted.
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)—In response to concerns over global climate change, some states have developed initiatives to stimulate national climate legislation through CO2 emission reductions in the electric power industry. New Jersey withdrew from RGGI in 2012. However, certain northeastern states (RGGI States), including New York and Connecticut where we have generation facilities, have state-specific rules in place to enable the RGGI regulatory mandate in each state to cap and reduce CO2 emissions. 
These rules make allowances available through a regional auction whereby generators may acquire allowances that are each equal to one ton of CO2 emissions. Generators are required to submit an allowance for each ton emitted over a three-year period. Allowances are available through the auction or through secondary markets.
In November 2015 the RGGI States initiated a 2016 Program Review stakeholder process. The focus of the 2016 Program Review is the post-2020 caps on GHG emissions and the incorporation of the EPA’s CPP requirements. 
New Jersey adopted the Global Warming Response Act in 2007, which calls for stabilizing its GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, followed by a further reduction of greenhouse emissions to 80% below 2006 levels by 2050. To reach this goal, the NJDEP, the BPU, other state agencies and stakeholders are required to evaluate methods to meet and exceed the emission reduction targets, taking into account their economic benefits and costs.
Water Pollution Control
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) prohibits the discharge of pollutants to U.S. waters from point sources, except pursuant to a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued by the EPA or by a state under a federally authorized state program. The FWPCA authorizes the imposition of technology-based and water quality-based effluent limits to regulate the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and ground waters. The EPA has delegated authority to a number of state agencies, including those in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, to administer the NPDES program through state action. We also have ownership interests in facilities in other jurisdictions that have their own laws and implement regulations to control discharges to their surface waters and ground waters that directly govern our facilities in those jurisdictions.
Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines—In September 2015, the EPA issued a new Effluent Guidelines Limitation Rule for steam electric generating units. The rule establishes new best available technology economically achievable (BAT) standards for fly ash transport water, bottom ash transport water, flue gas desulfurization and flue gas mercury control wastewater. The EPA provides an implementation period for currently existing discharges of three years or up to eight years if a facility needs more time to implement equipment upgrades and provide supporting information to its permitting authority. In the intervening time period, existing discharge standards continue to apply. Power’s Bridgeport Harbor stations and the jointly-owned Keystone and Conemaugh stations, have bottom ash transport water discharges that are regulated under this rule. We are unable to predict if this rule will have a material impact on our future capital requirements, financial condition and results of operations. 
In addition to regulating the discharge of pollutants, the FWPCA regulates the intake of surface waters for cooling. The use of cooling water is a significant part of the generation of electricity at steam-electric generating stations. Section 316(b) of the FWPCA requires that cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impact. The impact of regulations under Section 316(b) can be significant, particularly at steam-electric generating stations which do not have closed cycle cooling and do not use cooling towers to recycle water for cooling purposes. 
23

The installation of cooling towers at an existing generating station can impose significant engineering challenges and significant costs, which can affect the economic viability of a particular plant.
Cooling Water Intake Structure Regulation—In May 2014, the EPA issued a final cooling water intake rule under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) that establishes new requirements for the regulation of cooling water intakes at existing power plants and industrial facilities with a design flow of more than two million gallons of water per day.  
The EPA has structured the rule so that each state Permitting Director will continue to consider renewal permits for existing power facilities on a case by case basis. In connection with assessment of the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts of each facility that seeks a permit renewal, the rule requires that facilities conduct a wide range of studies related to impingement mortality and entrainment and submit the results with their permit applications. 
In September 2014, several environmental non-governmental groups and certain energy industry groups filed petitions for review of the rule and the case has been assigned to the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals (Second Circuit). Environmental organizations, including but not limited to the environmental petitioners in the Second Circuit, have also filed suit under the Endangered Species Act. The cases were subsequently consolidated at the Second Circuit and a decision is expected by mid-2017.
We are assessing the potential impact of the rule on each of our affected facilities and are unable to predict the outcome of permitting decisions and the effect, if any, that they may have on our future capital requirements, financial condition or results of operations, although such impacts could be material. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data— Note 13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for additional information. 
In June 2016, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) issued the final New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) permit for Salem, with an effective date of August 1, 2016. The final permit does not require installation of cooling towers and allows Salem to continue to operate utilizing the existing once-through cooling water system. The final permit does not mandate specific service water system modifications, but consistent with Section 316 (b) of the Clean Water Act, it requires additional studies and the selection of technology to address impingement for the service water system. In July 2016, the Delaware Riverkeeper Network (Riverkeeper) filed a request challenging the NJDEP’s issuance of a final NJPDES renewal permit for Salem. The Riverkeeper’s filing does not change the effective date of the permit. For additional information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. 
We are actively engaged with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CTDEEP) regarding renewal of the current permit for the cooling water intake structure at Bridgeport Harbor Station Unit 3 (BH3). To address compliance with the EPA’s CWA Section 316(b) final rule, the current proposal under consideration is that, if a final permit is issued, we would continue to operate BH3 without making the capital expenditures for modification to the existing intake structure and retire the BH3 within five years of the effective date of the final permit. Based on current discussions with the CTDEEP, if the proposal is accepted, a final permit could be issued in 2017 with a retirement date for BH3 by summer 2021, which is four years earlier than the previously estimated useful life ending in 2025. If the permit is not issued and the conditions below are not met, we may seek to operate BH3 through the previously estimated useful life.
Separately, we have also negotiated a Community Environmental Benefit Agreement (CEBA) with the City of Bridgeport, Connecticut. That CEBA provides that we would retire BH3 early if all its precedent conditions occur, which include receipt of all final permits to build and operate a proposed new combined cycle generating facility on the same site that BH3 currently operates, which could occur in 2017. Absent those conditions being met, and the permit renewal referred to above not being issued, we may seek to operate BH3 through the previously estimated useful life. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 3. Early Plant Retirements.
In February 2016, the proposed generating facility, Bridgeport Harbor Station Unit 5 (BH5), was awarded a capacity obligation. Construction is expected to commence in 2017, with operations expected to begin in mid-2019. The Connecticut Siting Council issued an order to approve siting BH5. All major environmental permits have been obtained except for the New Source air permit that is currently in draft form for public comment.
Waters of the United States—In April 2014, the EPA Administrator and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) jointly published a proposed rule to clarify the definition of waters of the U.S. under the CWA programs in order to protect the streams and wetlands that form the foundation of the nation’s water resources. This definition will have broad application to all areas of compliance under the CWA, including permitted discharges and construction activities. The final rule was published in June 2015 and various states, industry coalitions and environmental organizations have initiated legal action related to the provisions of the final rule as well as which court has jurisdiction over the rule. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on the question of jurisdiction by June 2017. Some states, including New Jersey, are subject to state requirements beyond those imposed under federal law. While we do not anticipate material impacts to projects in New Jersey, the new definition could impose requirements in other states and regions that could impact the development of renewables. 
24

Bridgeport Harbor National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Compliance—In April 2015, we determined that monitoring and reporting practices related to certain permitted wastewater discharges at our Bridgeport Harbor station may have violated conditions of the station’s NPDES permit and applicable regulations and could subject us to fines and penalties. We have notified the CTDEEP of the issues and have taken actions to investigate and resolve the potential non-compliance. We cannot predict the impact of this matter.
Endangered Species Act—In June 2015, the Sierra Club and another environmental group submitted to the NJDEP a sixty-day notice of intent to sue alleging the agency has caused violations of the Endangered Species Act by allowing our Mercer generation station to operate in a manner which has caused the mortality of certain species of sturgeon. Among other things, the notice requested the NJDEP to prioritize completion of a permit renewal action for Mercer which addresses the alleged Endangered Species Act violations. We are currently working with the National Marine Fisheries Service regarding an Incidental Take Permit that will outline operation and monitoring requirements through retirement of the Mercer generation station in May 2017 and subsequent decommissioning. 
Hazardous Substance Liability
The production and delivery of electricity and the distribution and manufacture of gas result in various by-products and substances classified by federal and state regulations as hazardous. These regulations may impose liability for damages to the environment from hazardous substances, including obligations to conduct environmental remediation of discharged hazardous substances as well as monetary payments, regardless of the absence of fault and the absence of any prohibitions against the activity when it occurred, as compensation for injuries to natural resources. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Our historic operations and the operations of hundreds of other companies along the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers are alleged by federal and state agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the Passaic River/Newark Bay Complex. The EPA is also evaluating the Hackensack River, a tributary to Newark Bay, for inclusion in the Superfund program. We no longer manufacture gas. For additional information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.
Site Remediation—The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act (Spill Act) require the remediation of discharged hazardous substances and authorize the EPA, the NJDEP and private parties to commence lawsuits to compel clean-ups or reimbursement for such remediation. The clean-ups can be more complicated and costly when the hazardous substances are in a body of water.
Natural Resource Damages—CERCLA and the Spill Act authorize the assessment of damages against persons who have discharged a hazardous substance, causing an injury to natural resources. Pursuant to the Spill Act, the NJDEP requires persons conducting remediation to characterize injuries to natural resources and to address those injuries through restoration or damages. The NJDEP adopted regulations concerning site investigation and remediation that require an ecological evaluation of potential damages to natural resources in connection with an environmental investigation of contaminated sites. The NJDEP also issued guidance to assist parties in calculating their natural resource damage liability for settlement purposes, but has stated that those calculations are applicable only for those parties that volunteer to settle a claim for natural resource damages before a claim is asserted by the NJDEP. We are currently unable to assess the magnitude of the potential financial impact of this regulatory change, although such impacts could be material.
Fuel and Waste Disposal
Nuclear Fuel Disposal—The federal government has entered into contracts with the operators of nuclear power plants for transportation and ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel. To pay for this service, nuclear plant owners are required to contribute to a Nuclear Waste Fund. In accordance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, in 2009 the DOE conducted its annual review of the adequacy of the Nuclear Waste Fee and concluded that the current fee of 1/10 cent per kWh was adequate to recover program costs. In 2011, we joined the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) and fifteen other nuclear plant operators in a lawsuit in federal court seeking suspension of the Nuclear Waste Fee. In June 2012, the court ruled that the DOE failed to justify continued payments by electricity consumers into the Nuclear Waste Fund and ordered the DOE to conduct a complete reassessment of this fee. Spent nuclear fuel generated in any reactor can be stored in reactor facility storage pools or in Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations located at reactors or away from reactor sites. Since May 2014, the DOE reduced the nuclear waste fee to zero. Prior to the elimination of this fee, the annualized pre-tax cost was approximately $30 million.
We have on-site storage facilities that are expected to satisfy the storage needs of Salem 1, Salem 2, Hope Creek, Peach Bottom 2 and Peach Bottom 3 through the end of their operating licenses. 
Low Level Radioactive Waste—As a by-product of their operations, nuclear generation units produce low level radioactive waste. Such waste includes paper, plastics, protective clothing, water purification materials and other materials. These waste materials are accumulated on site and disposed of at licensed permanent disposal facilities. New Jersey, Connecticut and South Carolina have formed the Atlantic Compact, which gives New Jersey nuclear generators continued access to the Barnwell waste disposal facility which is owned by South Carolina. We believe that the Atlantic Compact will provide for adequate low level 
25

radioactive waste disposal for Salem and Hope Creek through the end of their current licenses including full decommissioning, although no assurances can be given. Low Level Radioactive Waste is periodically being shipped to the Barnwell site from Salem and Hope Creek. Additionally, there are on-site storage facilities for Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom, which we believe have the capacity for at least five years of temporary storage for each facility.
Coal Combustion Residuals (CCRs)—In December 2014, the EPA issued a final rule that regulates CCRs as non-hazardous and requires that facility owners implement a series of actions to close or upgrade existing CCR surface impoundments and/or landfills. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for additional information. 
In December 2016, the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act was enacted, which includes provisions regarding CCRs which allow for implementation of the EPA CCR rule through a state or EPA-based permit program. We believe this will have minimal impact to our operations.
