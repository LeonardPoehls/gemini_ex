Description of Business
 
BACKGROUND
 
Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we", "our", "us", "OMNI", OMGT or "Omni Global Technologies, Inc." refers to Omni Global Technologies Inc. (formerly Business.vn, Inc.)
 
Omni Global Technologies, Inc. (“OMNI” or the "Company") was originally formed on September 15, 1995 as Interactive Processing, Inc., a Nevada corporation, to market high-tech consumer electronics through television home-shopping networks, retail stores, catalog companies and their website remotecontrols.com. In March 1999, the Company changed its name to Worldtradeshow.com, Inc. In April, 1999, the Company acquired intellectual property rights to a database and business plan and significantly changed its business plan to develop tradeshow software and market both physical and virtual tradeshow space through the Company's website.
 
The Company has been dormant since October 2008 and was under the control of a Receiver in Nevada’s Eighth Judicial District in #A14- 715484-P as of May 15, 2016. As of April 30, 2016 the Company had no assets. All liabilities outstanding as of April 30, 2009 have been carried over to the 2016 balance sheet; because these liabilities had not been technically discharged as of that date
 
Reverse Split and Name Change
 
On November 18, 2016, we effected a 1 for 150 reverse split and changed our name from Business.vn, Inc. to Omni Global Technologies, Inc., and the Company’s trading symbol changed from “BVNI” to “OMGT”. Under the guidelines of Staff Accounting Bulletin 4c, a capital structure change such as a stock split that occurs after the date of the most recent balance sheet must be given retroactive effect in the balance sheet. Accordingly, all references to the numbers of Common Shares and per share data in the accompanying financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this reverse split on a retroactive basis, unless indicated otherwise. As of April 30, 2016 we had 368,703 shares outstanding.
