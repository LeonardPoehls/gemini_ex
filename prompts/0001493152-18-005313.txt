Item 1. Description of Business.
Background
 
The Company, formerly known as Dove Street Acquisition Corporation, was incorporated in Delaware on July 22, 2016. The Company filed a registration statement on Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 9, 2016 and became a public reporting company. In January 2017, Dove Street Acquisition Corporation changed its name to Anvia Holdings Corporation. On January 10, 2017, the Company effected a change of control with the resignation of the then officers and directors, redemption of 19,500,000 shares of the 20,000,000 outstanding shares of its common stock, the appointment of new officers and directors and the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of common stock, pro rata, to the new shareholders of the Company.
 
The Company has an authorized capitalization of 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 1,000 shares have been designated Series A Preferred Stock. The Company has a fiscal year end of December 31. As of the date of this registration statement, there are 19,003,367 shares of common stock of the Company issued and outstanding and 1000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.
 
The Company has only recently commenced operations as a development-stage company, and it has limited operating history and is expected to experience losses in the near term. The Company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Business Plan
 
The Company is headquartered in Glendale, California, and was incorporated in Delaware on July 22, 2016. Anvia is a development-stage company formed to provide vocational training and education industry for construction tradesmen in Australia, a region which we believe presents a valuable market opportunity. Through its Anvia Loyalty and Anvia Learning mobile applications, the Company has developed a fully integrated learning and student management system that can digitally track learning time and offer a personalized training experience that is customized for every student. Currently, we believe that the outlook for construction in the Australia exceeds the labor supply pool and that the Australian government will provide financing in this core sector to help meet market demand. This is precisely the market gap that Anvia will address.

The Department of Education of Australia has established a national vocational education and training framework, with associated regulations. The Australia Qualifications Framework (AQF) provides national recognition of vocational education and training qualifications, allowing the award to be used across different Australian states. The AQF requires training organizations to meet certain standards to deliver and assess nationally recognized training, and issue nationally recognized qualifications. The Company has budgeted all cost associated to qualification certification in the segments that it operates it.


Of the hundreds of qualifications available in the Australian framework, the Company will specialize in providing 40 different qualifications that provides certifications I, II, III, IV, Diploma and Advanced Diploma in the construction industry. These include training for roofing, plumbing, home renovation, electrical and carpentry. We expect that specialization in these areas will make Anvia stand out as a market leader in this niche.
 
We believe that Brisbane, Australia, is a hotbed for vocational training for the construction market. Brisbane is in the capital of Queensland, which is a hot zone that holds 31.9% of establishments in the region. In the near future, it is expected that the government reform learning institute’s boundaries, which will allow establishments to operate on a national scope. Furthermore, the Company expects to have several revenue streams, such as its recruitment, ecommerce and loyalty channels, that will conduct operation on an international scope. The Company expects to also open satellite offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth upon completion of the scope and infrastructure in Brisbane. The Company has an administrative office and is in process of establishing classrooms that can hold up to 40 students on site and various workshops. Anvia currently operates 5 days and plans to extend operations to 7 days a week, including evenings, to accommodate students that work during normal business hours. The Company has developed a fully integrated learning and student management system that can digitally track learning time an offer a personalized training experience custom to every student.
 
Projected Milestones
 
The Company has a five-year plan that we expect will propel this venture into lasting success. The details and projected milestones are listed below:
 

● | Secure Location, hire and launch (Immediately). The first objective of the Company is to acquire its RTO and 20 qualification licenses. At the same time, the Company will secure its location and build out a training facility. We expect that the Company will be operational in 6 months or less from the time it has obtained funding and opens its regional offices in Melbourne and Sydney. We expect that our mobile application will be operational prior to the launch. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Local and Digital Marketing (by Year 1). Upon becoming operational, the Company will initiate its various local and online marketing campaigns. The objective is to build out its onsite student base and wider consumer base using its eLearning and mobile assets described in the business plan. 
● | Alumni Outreach (years 2-5). Upon successfully graduate of its first year’s cohorts, the Company will maintain an aggressive outreach to alumni to remain active in the Anvia Network. Alumnus are a valuable segment for the Company as they will need to take annual CPD learning and other services described in the business plan. 

 
Products/Services
 
Anvia will offer the following services and products designed for the Vocational Education and Training industry. They are as follows:
 
Anvia’s Mobile Applications:
 
The Company has also developed and launched its own proprietary “Anvia Loyalty” and “Anvia Learning” mobile applications, which are currently available on the Google Play and IOS store. We expect our applications to be an invaluable asset that will complement the onsite learning experience. We expect that our applications will contain 6 features:

● | Blended Learning: Using the Company’s Learning Management System (LMS), students will be able to take advantage of a learning system that identifies their weak points and adapts to their needs. The Company’s LMS will offer learning through video, reading and live classes. Students will be able to track their progress and utilize the applications eLearning program to learn on the go. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Work tools: This will be an online platform for construction tradesmen to create custom invoicing, bidding and proposal letters to client prospects. Work tools will be a value resource for small operations to learn how to submit Requests for Procurement (RFPs) to cities and business as well as offer general legal and technical contracts for their trade. 
● | Resource center and digital library: Anvia has integrated its applications with Overdrive Inc., a United States based company (“Overdrive”), the largest digital library and eBooks platform in the world, to connect to existing national public or private libraries to offer a knowledge base of practical tips and self-help guides in their market. Students will also have access to a digital library of any literature of their choosing. 
● | Peer-to-Peer Networking: Anvia will promote peer-to-peer networking for tradesmen to collaborate and assist each other in their career challenges. Inside the app, tradesmen will be able to ask each other questions and provide peer-based solutions. 
● | Shopping: The Loyalty shopping portable will be accessible to via the Company’s mobile application. The portal will track expenditures and offer cash back on all purchases. The Company has recently entered into agreements with several suppliers, such as Stanley Footwear Consortium Sdn Bhd, YKGI Bhd and Asteel Sdn Bhd (“Asteel”), pursuant to which we will distribute these companies’ products through our platforms.

Qualification Training:
 
The Company will offer certifications in the areas that it operates in. Consumers will pay a lump sum fee. Anvia will train local students but also offer e-learning courses that students can access internationally. In the future, the Company intends to acquire and establish branches in new territories.
Licensing:
 
Tradesmen are required to obtain White Cards and Proof of Competency Cards on an annual basis to be licensed. The Company will offer the training and testing services for these areas. The Company will provide certificates in more than 40 different qualifications. Details on some of Company’s licensing offerings are listed below.

● | Certificate I. Certificate I is the lowest tertiary education qualifications available under the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF). It equips individuals with basic functional knowledge and skills for initial work, further learning and community involvement. Graduates at this level can undertake routine tasks and identify simple problems. Certificate I courses are also offered to secondary school students. This segment’s contribution to industry revenue has remained stable over the past five years. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Certificate II. Certificate II is the second-lowest complexity of tertiary education qualifications under the AQF. It prepares individuals for work in a defined area, and for further learning. Graduates at this level will have basic technical and procedural skills to undertake defined tasks and provide solutions to simple problems. Some Certificate II courses are offered at selected secondary schools, but this revenue is not included in the industry. Over the past five years, this segment’s contribution to industry revenue has declined due to greater demand for higher qualifications, as businesses have increasingly required skilled workers. 
● | Certificate III. Certificate III courses account for the largest share of industry revenue, as they are the most popular qualification attained in the Technical and Vocational Education and Training industry. Certificate III courses equip graduates with practical and theoretical knowledge for work and further learning. Certificate III graduates may be able to work autonomously and take on limited responsibility. This segment’s share of industry revenue has increased over the past five years, reflecting the growing trend of workers upskilling. 

Continuous Professional Development (CPD):
 
To stay complaint, tradesmen are required to take annual 12 hours of CPD training. The Company offers CPD instructions that will be another source of residual income.
Loyalty Program:
 
Many tradesmen in the construction industry become small business contractors that bill for time and materials. These contractors procure materials at their local hardware store. Anvia will develop an e-commerce shopping portal for competitively priced materials based on volume purchase commitments. Contractors can purchase their materials within the Anvia shopping portal and received up to 10% cash back. This will be a source of income for contractors that they would otherwise not be privy too. Anvia will also receive a commission for all purchases made on the shopping portal. The Company has recently entered into agreements with several suppliers, such as Stanley Footwear Consortium Sdn Bhd, YKGI Bhd and Asteel, pursuant to which we will distribute these companies’ products through our platforms.
Future Business Applications
 
Anvia envisions developing an integrated ecosystem for tradesmen in the construction industry. While the business plan does not call for these channels, in the future Anvia will explore diverse business applications:

● | On Demand Services: The Company will develop a vast network of students, recent graduates and alumni. In the future, it will be poised to offer an on-demand service for home improvement and general home advisory help. They are several successful existing services like this in the marketplace. The Company may explore a licensing or other partnership opportunity 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Domestic Acquisitions: They are currently no large players in the vocational training industry. As Anvia develops its brand in its regional market, the Company will grow its presence geographically via acquisitions. 
● | International certifications: Many developing economies in the ASEAN and other nearby countries use Australia’s certification framework system. Australia also has a tremendous work visa program.

The Market: Vocational Training and Education in Australia
 
Construction is the third largest employing industry in Australia, employing 1,055,200 workers, or 9.1 per cent of total employment, as of February 2015. Over the past decade, Construction has experienced strong employment growth, with employment in the industry increasing by 221,400 (or 26.6 per cent) over the 10 years to February 2015, making it the third largest growth industry in Australia over this period. This represents a growth rate of 2.4 per cent per annum, compared with 1.8 per cent per annum recorded across all industries. This strong growth has been driven by the housing and commercial needs of an expanding population, as well as ongoing investment in public and private infrastructure.
 
Construction industry employment is projected to grow by 137,900 (or 13.0 per cent) over the five years to November 2019, well above the growth rate of 10% projected for employment as a whole. Looking ahead, employment growth in the industry is expected to be supported by historically low interest rates, the recent strength in building approvals, and the housing needs of Australia’s steadily growing population. Employment growth over the five years to November 2019 is projected to be largest in the Building Installation Services sector (up by 50,400 or 20.7 per cent), followed by Building Completion Services (24,800 or 13.0 per cent), Other Construction Services (15,800 or 13.9 per cent) and Building Structure Services (12,600 or 16.3 per cent). Only the Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction sector is projected to record a decline over the five years to November 2019 (down by 6,500 or 8.3 per cent), with conditions in this sector expected to be constrained by weakening conditions in Mining.
 
The number of students accessing financing from the Australian government rose from about from 55,000 in 2012 to more than 272,000 in 2015. Vocational loans increased from $26.0 million in 2012 to more than $2.9 billion in 2015. According to the licensedtrades.com.au there are over 1.4M trade professionals across 47 licensing bodies in Australia. As part of the National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform, the Australian Federal Government has allocated its states and territories $1.8 billion over the five years through 2016-17, on top of $7.0 billion in base funding. This funding was offered on the condition that these governments meet several targets, such as reducing upfront costs for students and increasing private investment through loans for diplomas. The number of students accessing VET FEE-HELP rose from about from 55,000 in 2012 to more than 272,000 in 2015. VET FEE-HELP loans increased from $26.0 million in 2012 to more than $2.9 billion in 2015.
 
The Australian Vocational and training revenue is expected to grow by an annualized 1.3% over the five years through 2016-17, to $8.8 billion. The industry is forecast to grow at an annualized 0.5% over the next five years, to reach $9.1 billion.
 
The industry has moderate barriers to entry and this has remained steady over the past five years, despite fluctuations. In 2012, government policy made the industry more market-based. However, recent Australian Federal Government initiatives have limited the amount of funding available to industry players and placed strict requirements on new entrants. Although industry concentration is low, operators still need to establish a strong reputation to attract students. Developing a good reputation can take time, and this can deter new entrants. Capital intensity in the industry is low, but significant investment is required initially to secure land, buildings and classroom equipment.
 
The Company’s target market will be construction tradesmen and future construction tradesmen that need qualifications for roofing, plumbing, home renovation, electrical and carpentry. The share of Construction industry workers who have a level of educational attainment above Year 12 or equivalent is the same as the share recorded across all industries (59.7 per cent). The critical role of trade skills in the Construction industry, however, is reflected in the 45.3 per cent share of Construction industry workers who have completed a Certificate III/IV qualification, which is significantly higher than the corresponding share across all industries (20.6 per cent). By contrast, the Construction industry’s share of workers who have attained a Bachelor’s Degree or higher (7.8 per cent) is significantly lower than the corresponding share across all industries (28.5 per cent).
 
Competition
 
The Vocational Education and Training industry has a low level of market share concentration with no player owning more than 5% market share. The biggest players in the industry are public education programs and private operators, such as the Australian Careers Network Ltd and Navitas Limited. Despite a limited competitive landscape, the Company expects to command advantages over existing operators as Anvia will specialize in an underserved market niche and expects to offer a superior technological learning platform.
 
In Australia, technical and further education or “TAFE” system is largely state-based, which means that each state has developed individual vocational education and training systems. The Australian Federal Government is encouraging reform to develop a competitive and responsive national system. While the states coordinate their own TAFE systems and are a dominant influence in the industry, they are not major players. The following section outlines the two largest TAFE systems and the institutions.

The three biggest institutes are the Western Sydney Institute, Sydney Institute and South-Western Sydney Institute. TAFE NSW enrolls more than 550,000 students. TAFE NSW increased its tuition fees by an average of 9.5% in 2013 and by a further 5.7% in 2014, in response to funding cuts from the NSW Government. Combined, TAFE NSW generated $1.9 billion in revenue in 2014-15, with 71.0%
 
The Victorian style of management is more decentralized than its counterparts in other states, with no umbrella organization. The state’s VET sector consists of 18 public TAFE institutions and more than 1,300 private providers. In Victoria, four universities also offer TAFE-level courses: RMIT University, Victoria University of Technology and Swinburne University in Melbourne, and Federation University in Ballarat, VIC.
