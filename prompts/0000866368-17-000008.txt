 The Company
 ﻿
 PS Business Parks, Inc. (“PSB”) is a fully-integrated, self-advised and self-managed REIT that owns, operates, acquires and develops commercial properties, primarily multi-tenant flex, office and industrial space. PS Business Parks, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) is a California limited partnership, which owns directly or indirectly substantially all of our assets and through which we conduct substantially all of our business. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references to “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and similar references mean PS Business Parks, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership. PSB is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of December 31, 2016, owned 77.9% of the common partnership units. The remaining common partnership units are owned by Public Storage (“PS”). Assuming issuance of PSB common stock upon redemption of the common partnership units held by PS, PS would own 42.0% (or 14.5 million shares) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock. PSB, as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in managing and controlling the Operating Partnership.
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned and operated 28.1 million rentable square feet of commercial space, comprising 99 business parks, in the following states: California, Texas, Virginia, Florida, Maryland and Washington. The Company focuses on owning concentrated business parks which provide the Company with the greatest flexibility to meet the needs of its customers. The Company also manages 684,000 rentable square feet on behalf of PS.
 ﻿
 History of the Company: The Company was formed in 1990 as a California corporation under the name Public Storage Properties XI, Inc. In a March 17, 1998 merger with American Office Park Properties, Inc. (“AOPP”) (the “Merger”), the Company acquired the commercial property business operated by AOPP and was renamed “PS Business Parks, Inc.” Prior to the Merger, in January, 1997, AOPP was reorganized to succeed to the commercial property business of PS, becoming a fully integrated, self-advised and self-managed REIT.

 In 2013, the Company entered into a joint venture known as Amherst JV LLC (the “Joint Venture”) with an unrelated real estate development company (the “JV Partner”) for the purpose of developing a 395-unit multi-family building on a five-acre site within The Mile in Tysons, Virginia (the “Project”). PSB holds a 95.0% interest in the Joint Venture with the remaining 5.0% held by the JV Partner. The JV Partner is responsible for the development and construction of the Project and through an affiliate will oversee the leasing and management of the Project as it is completed. The aggregate amount of development costs are estimated to be $105.6 million (excluding unrealized land appreciation), of which the Company is committed to funding $75.0 million through a construction loan in addition to capital contributions of $28.5 million, which includes a land basis of $15.3 million, to the Joint Venture. The Company’s investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint venture was $67.2 million as of December 31, 2016. The Project is expected to deliver its first completed units in the spring of 2017, with final completion of the Project expected in early 2018.
 ﻿
 As of November 1, 2016, the Company transferred a 123,000 square foot building also located within The Mile in Tysons, Virginia to land and building held for development, as the Company is pursuing entitlements to develop an additional multi-family complex on this site. The scope and timing of any future development will be subject to a variety of approvals and contingencies. Prior to being classified as land and building held for development, the building was occupied by a single user. The net operating income (“NOI”) associated with the prior tenant is reflected as NOI from assets sold or held for development.
 ﻿
 During 2015, the Company sold four business parks, aggregating 492,000 square feet, in non-strategic markets for net proceeds of $41.2 million, which resulted in a gain of $23.4 million. Additionally, as part of an eminent domain process, the Company sold five buildings, aggregating 82,000 square feet, at the Company’s Overlake Business Park located in Redmond, Washington, for $13.9 million, which resulted in a gain of $4.8 million. 
 ﻿
 During 2014, the Company sold five business parks aggregating 1.9 million square feet and 11.5 acres of land in non-strategic markets, including Portland, Oregon and Phoenix, Arizona, for net proceeds of $212.2 million, which resulted in a gain of $92.4 million. With these sales the Company completed its stated objective of exiting non-strategic markets in Sacramento, California, Oregon and Arizona.
 ﻿
 The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1990. To the extent that the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not be taxed, with certain limited exceptions, on the net income that is currently distributed to its shareholders.
 ﻿
 The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 701 Western Avenue, Glendale, California 91201-2349. The Company’s telephone number is (818) 244-8080. The Company maintains a website with the address www.psbusinessparks.com.

Business of the Company: The Company is in the commercial property business, with 99 business parks consisting of multi-tenant flex, industrial and office space. The Company owns 14.6 million square feet of flex space which the Company defines as buildings that are configured with a combination of warehouse and office space and can be designed to fit a wide variety of uses. The warehouse component of the flex space has a number of uses including light manufacturing and assembly, storage and warehousing, showroom, laboratory, distribution and research and development activities. The office component of flex space is complementary to the warehouse component by enabling businesses to accommodate management and production staff in the same facility. The Company owns 8.8 million square feet of industrial space that has characteristics similar to the warehouse component of the flex space as well as ample dock access. In addition, the Company owns 4.7 million square feet of low-rise office space, generally either in business parks that combine office and flex space or in submarkets where the market demand is more office focused.
 ﻿
 The Company’s commercial properties typically consist of business parks with low-rise buildings, ranging from one to 49 buildings per park, located on parcels of various sizes which comprise from nearly 12,000 to 3.5 million aggregate square feet of rentable space. Facilities are managed through either on-site management or offices central to the facilities. Parking is generally open but in some instances is covered. The ratio of parking spaces to rentable square feet generally ranges from two to six per thousand square feet depending upon the use of the property and its location. Office space generally requires a greater parking ratio than most industrial uses. 
 ﻿
 The tenant base for the Company’s facilities is diverse. The portfolio can be bifurcated into those facilities that service small to medium-sized businesses and those that service larger businesses. Approximately 35.9% of in-place rents from the portfolio are derived from facilities that generally serve small to medium-sized businesses. A property in this facility type is typically divided into units under 5,000 square feet and leases generally range from one to three years. The remaining 64.1% of in-place rents from the portfolio are generally derived from facilities that serve larger businesses, with units 5,000 square feet and larger. The Company also has several tenants that lease space in multiple buildings and locations. The U.S. Government is the largest tenant with multiple leases encompassing approximately 692,000 square feet, or 4.6% of the Company’s annualized rental income.
 ﻿
 The Company owns operating properties in six states and it may expand its operations to other states or reduce the number of states in which it operates. Properties are acquired for both income and potential capital appreciation; there is no limitation on the amount that can be invested in any specific property. 
 ﻿
 The Company owns land which may be used for the future development of commercial properties including approximately 14.0 acres in Dallas, Texas and 6.4 acres in Northern Virginia. 
 ﻿
 Operating Partnership
 ﻿
 The properties in which the Company has an equity interest generally are owned by the Operating Partnership. Through this organizational structure, the Company has the ability to acquire interests in additional properties in transactions that could defer the contributors’ tax consequences by causing the Operating Partnership to issue equity interests in return for interests in properties.  
 ﻿
 The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 77.9% of the common partnership units of the Operating Partnership, and the remainder of such common partnership units were owned by PS. The common units owned by PS may be redeemed by PS from time to time, subject to the provisions of our charter, for cash or, at our option, shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis. Also as of December 31, 2016, in connection with the Company’s issuance of publicly traded Cumulative Preferred Stock, the Company owned 44.4 million preferred units of the Operating Partnership of various series with an aggregate redemption value of $1.1 billion with terms substantially identical to the terms of the publicly traded depositary shares each representing 1/1,000 of a share of 5.20% to 6.45% Cumulative Preferred Stock of the Company. On December 7, 2016, the Company called for the redemption of its 6.45% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series S, at its par value of $230.0 million. As of December 31, 2016, the Company reclassified the 6.45% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series S, of $230.0 million from equity to liabilities as preferred stock called for redemption.

 As the general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company has the exclusive responsibility under the Operating Partnership Agreement to manage and conduct the business of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership is responsible for, and pays when due, its share of all administrative and operating expenses of the properties it owns.
 ﻿
 The Company’s interest in the Operating Partnership entitles it to share in cash distributions from, and the profits and losses of, the Operating Partnership in proportion to the Company’s economic interest in the Operating Partnership (apart from tax allocations of profits and losses to take into account pre-contribution property appreciation or depreciation). The Company, since 1998, has paid per share dividends on its common and preferred stock that track, on a one-for-one basis, the amount of per unit cash distributions the Company receives from the Operating Partnership in respect of the common and preferred partnership units in the Operating Partnership that are owned by the Company.
 ﻿
 Common Officers and Directors with PS
 ﻿
 Ronald L. Havner, Jr., Chairman of the Company, is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Trustee and Chief Executive Officer of PS. Joseph D. Russell, Jr. is a director of the Company and also President of PS. Gary E. Pruitt, an independent director of the Company, is also a trustee of PS. Other employees of PS render services to the Company pursuant to the cost sharing and administrative services agreement.
 ﻿
 Property Management Services
 ﻿
 The Company manages commercial properties owned by PS, which are generally adjacent to self-storage facilities, for a management fee equal to 5% of the gross revenues of such properties in addition to reimbursement of certain costs. The property management contract with PS is for a seven-year term with the agreement automatically extending for an additional one-year period upon each one-year anniversary of its commencement (unless cancelled by either party). Either party can give notice of its intent to cancel the agreement upon expiration of its current term. Management fee revenue derived from this management contract with PS totaled $518,000, $540,000 and $660,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the Company managed 684,000 rentable square feet on behalf of PS compared to 813,000 rentable square feet as of December 31, 2015.
 ﻿
 PS also provides property management services for the self-storage component of two assets owned by the Company. These self-storage facilities, located in Palm Beach County, Florida, operate under the “Public Storage” name. Either the Company or PS can cancel the property management contract upon 60 days’ notice. Management fee expenses under the contract were $86,000, $79,000 and $70,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 ﻿
 Management
 ﻿
 Maria R. Hawthorne leads the Company’s senior management team.  Ms. Hawthorne became President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company beginning July 1, 2016. Prior to July 1, 2016, Joseph D. Russell, Jr. was the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Company’s senior management includes: John W. Petersen, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Edward A. Stokx, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Christopher M. Auth, Vice President (Washington Metro Division); Trenton A. Groves, Vice President and Corporate Controller; Coby A. Holley, Vice President, Investments; Robin E. Mather, Vice President, Business Development; Stuart H. Hutchison, Vice President (Southern California and Pacific Northwest Divisions); Eddie F. Ruiz, Vice President and Director of Facilities; Richard E. Scott, Vice President (Northern California Division); Eugene Uhlman, Vice President, Construction Management; and David A. Vicars, Vice President (Southeast Division, which includes Florida and Texas).
 ﻿
 REIT Structure
 ﻿
 If certain detailed conditions imposed by the Code and the related Treasury Regulations are met, an entity, such as the Company, that invests principally in real estate and that otherwise would be taxed as a corporation may elect to be treated as a REIT. The most important consequence to the Company of being treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is that the Company can deduct dividend distributions (including distributions on preferred stock) to its shareholders, thus effectively eliminating the “double taxation” (at the corporate and shareholder levels) that typically 

 
5


 
results when a corporation earns income and distributes that income to shareholders in the form of dividends.
 ﻿
 The Company believes that it has operated, and intends to continue to operate, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT under the Code, but no assurance can be given that it will at all times so qualify. To the extent that the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not be taxed, with certain limited exceptions, on the REIT taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders.
 ﻿
 Operating Strategy
 ﻿
 The Company believes its operating, acquisition and finance strategies combined with its diversified portfolio produces a low risk, stable growth business model. The Company’s primary objective is to grow shareholder value. Key elements of the Company’s growth strategy include:
 ﻿
 Maximize Net Cash Flow of Existing Properties: The Company seeks to maximize the net cash flow generated by its properties by (i) maximizing average occupancy rates, (ii) achieving the highest possible levels of realized rent per occupied square foot, (iii) controlling its operating cost structure by improving operating efficiencies and economies of scale and (iv) minimizing recurring capital expenditures required to maintain and improve occupancy. The Company believes that its experienced property management personnel and comprehensive systems combined with focused economies of scale enhance the Company’s ability to meet these goals. The Company seeks to increase occupancy rates and realized rents per square foot by providing its field personnel with incentives to lease space to credit worthy tenants and to maximize the return on investment in each lease transaction. 
 ﻿
 Focus on Targeted Markets: The Company intends to continue investing in markets that have characteristics which enable them to be competitive economically. The Company believes that markets with a combination of above average population growth, job growth, higher education levels and personal income will produce better overall economic returns. The Company targets parks in high barrier to entry markets that are close to critical infrastructure, middle to high income housing or universities and have easy access to major transportation arteries.
 ﻿
 Reduce Capital Expenditures and Increase Occupancy Rates by Providing Flexible Properties and Attracting a Diversified Tenant Base: By focusing on properties with easily reconfigurable space, the Company believes it can offer facilities that appeal to a wide range of potential tenants, which aids in reducing recurring capital expenditures associated with re-leasing space. The Company believes this property flexibility also allows it to better serve existing tenants by accommodating expansion and contraction needs. In addition, the Company believes that a diversified tenant base enables it to attract a greater number of potential users to its space which, combined with flexible parks, helps it maintain occupancy rates.
 ﻿
 Provide Superior Property Management: The Company seeks to provide a superior level of service to its tenants in order to maintain occupancy and increase rental rates, as well as minimize customer turnover. The Company’s property management offices are located either on-site or regionally, providing tenants with convenient access to management and helping the Company maintain its properties and while conveying a sense of quality, order and security. The Company has significant experience in acquiring properties managed by others and thereafter improving tenant satisfaction, occupancy levels, retention rates and rental income by implementing established tenant service programs.
 ﻿
 Financing Strategy
 ﻿
 The Company’s primary objective in its financing strategy is to maintain financial flexibility and a low risk capital structure. Key elements of this strategy are:
 ﻿
 Retain Operating Cash Flow: The Company seeks to retain significant funds (after funding its distributions and capital improvements) for additional investments. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company distributed 41.4% and 31.7%, respectively, of its cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP, and 57.7% and 46.1%, respectively, of its funds from operations (“FFO”) to common shareholders/unit holders. FFO is computed in accordance with the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). The White Paper defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), before depreciation, amortization, gains or losses on asset dispositions, net income allocable to noncontrolling interests — common units, 

 
6


 
net income allocable to restricted stock unit holders, impairment charges and nonrecurring items. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be analyzed in conjunction with net income. However, FFO should not be viewed as a substitute for net income as a measure of operating performance or liquidity, as it does not reflect depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditure and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of the Company’s properties, which are significant economic costs and could materially impact the Company’s results of operations. Other REITs may use different methods for calculating FFO and, accordingly, the Company’s FFO may not be comparable to other real estate companies’ FFO. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Non-GAAP Supplemental Disclosure Measure: Funds from Operations” for a reconciliation of FFO and net income allocable to common shareholders and for additional information on why the Company presents FFO.
 ﻿
 Perpetual Preferred Stock/Units: The primary source of leverage in the Company’s capital structure is perpetual preferred stock or equivalent preferred units in the Operating Partnership. This method of financing reduces interest rate and refinancing risks as the dividend rate is fixed and the stated value or capital contribution is not required to be repaid. In addition, the consequences of defaulting on required preferred distributions are less severe than with debt. The preferred shareholders may elect two additional directors if six quarterly distributions go unpaid, whether or not consecutive.
 ﻿
 Throughout this Form 10-K, we use the term “preferred equity” to mean both the preferred stock issued by the Company (including the depositary shares representing interests in that preferred stock) and the preferred partnership units issued by the Operating Partnership and the term “preferred distributions” to mean dividends and distributions on the preferred stock and preferred partnership units.
 ﻿
 Debt Financing: The Company, from time to time, has used debt financing to facilitate real estate acquisitions and other capital allocations. The primary source of debt the Company has historically relied upon to provide short-term capital is its $250.0 million unsecured line of credit (the “Credit Facility”). In addition, during 2011, in connection with its $520.0 million portfolio acquisition in Northern California, the Company obtained a $250.0 million unsecured three-year term loan and assumed a $250.0 million mortgage note. The unsecured three-year term loan was repaid in full during 2013 and the $250.0 million mortgage note was repaid in full on June 1, 2016. From time to time, the Company may also consider other sources of unsecured debt financing to meet its capital needs.
 ﻿
 Access to Capital: The Company targets a minimum ratio of FFO to combined fixed charges and preferred distributions paid of 3.0 to 1.0. Fixed charges include interest expense and capitalized interest while preferred distributions include amounts paid to preferred shareholders and preferred Operating Partnership unit holders. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the FFO to combined fixed charges and preferred distributions paid ratio was 3.9 to 1.0, excluding the non-cash charge for the issuance costs related to the redemption of preferred equity. The Company believes that its financial position enables it to access capital to finance future growth. Subject to market conditions, the Company may add leverage to its capital structure. 
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 Competition in the market areas in which many of the Company’s properties are located is significant and has from time to time negatively impacted occupancy levels and rental rates of, and increased the operating expenses of, certain of these properties. Competition may be accelerated by any increase in availability of funds for investment in real estate. Barriers to entry are relatively low for those with the necessary capital and the Company competes for property acquisitions and tenants with entities that have greater financial resources than the Company. Sublease space and unleased developments continue to create competition among operators in certain markets in which the Company operates. While the Company will have to respond to market demands, management believes that the combination of its ability to offer a variety of options within its business parks and the Company’s financial stability provide it with an opportunity to compete favorably in its markets.
 ﻿
 The Company’s properties compete for tenants with similar properties located in its markets primarily on the basis of location, rent charged, services provided and the design and condition of improvements. The Company believes it possesses several distinguishing characteristics that enable it to compete effectively in the flex, office and industrial space markets. The Company believes its personnel are among the most experienced in these real estate markets. The Company’s facilities are part of a comprehensive system encompassing standardized procedures and integrated reporting and information networks. The Company believes that the significant operating and financial experience of 

 
7


 
its executive officers and directors combined with the Company’s capital structure, national investment scope, geographic diversity and economies of scale should enable the Company to compete effectively.
 ﻿
 Investments in Real Estate Facilities
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned and operated 28.1 million rentable square feet comprised of 99 business parks in six states compared to 28.0 million rentable square feet at December 31, 2015.    ﻿ Investment in and Advances to Unconsolidated Joint Venture
 ﻿
 PSB holds a 95.0% interest in the Joint Venture with the remaining 5.0% held by the JV Partner. The JV Partner is responsible for the development and construction of the Project and through an affiliate will oversee the leasing and management of the Project as it is completed. The Project is expected to deliver its first completed units in the spring of 2017, with final completion of the Project expected in early 2018.
 ﻿
 On October 5, 2015 (the “Contribution Date”), the Company contributed the site, along with capitalized improvements, to the Joint Venture. Subsequent to the Contribution Date, demolition, site preparation and construction commenced. The JV partner serves as the managing member, with mutual consent from both the Company and the managing member required for all significant decisions. As such, the Company accounts for its investment in the Joint Venture using the equity method.
 ﻿
 Along with the equity capital the Company has committed to the Joint Venture, the Company has also agreed to provide the Joint Venture with a construction loan in the amount of $75.0 million. The Joint Venture will pay interest under the construction loan at a rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 2.25%. The loan will mature on April 5, 2019 with two one-year extension options. The Company has reflected the aggregate value of the contributed site, its’ equity contributions, capitalized interest and loan advances to date as investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint venture. The aggregate amount of development costs are estimated to be $105.6 million (excluding unrealized land appreciation), of which the Company is committed to funding $75.0 million through a construction loan in addition to capital contributions of $28.5 million, which includes a land basis of $15.3 million, to the Joint Venture.    ﻿
 The Company’s investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint venture was $67.2 million and $26.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company made loan advances of $33.9 million, capital contributions of $5.7 million and capitalized $885,000 of interest.
 ﻿
 Summary of Business Model
 ﻿
 The Company has a geographically diversified portfolio in six states across the country with a diversified customer mix by both size and industry concentration. The Company believes that this diversification combined with a conservative financing strategy, a focus on markets with strong demographics for growth and a decentralized operating strategy gives the Company a business model that mitigates risk and provides strong long-term growth opportunities.
 ﻿
 Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates
 ﻿
 The Company’s Bylaws provide that the Company may engage in transactions with affiliates provided that a purchase or sale transaction with an affiliate is (i) approved by a majority of the Company’s independent directors and (ii) fair to the Company based on an independent appraisal or fairness opinion.
 ﻿
 Borrowings
 ﻿
 On June 1, 2016, the Company repaid in full the $250.0 million mortgage note which had a fixed interest rate of 5.45%.  See Notes 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for a summary of the Company’s outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2016. 
 ﻿
 The Company’s Credit Facility is with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”). Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company modified and extended the terms of its Credit Facility and the Company’s related guaranty.  The expiration date was extended from May 1, 2019 to January 10, 2022. The Credit Facility has a 

 
8


 
borrowing limit of $250.0 million. The rate of interest charged on borrowings was modified to a rate ranging from the LIBOR plus 0.80% to LIBOR plus 1.55%, depending on the Company’s credit ratings. Currently, the Company’s rate under the Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 0.825%, down from the previous rate of 0.875%. In addition, the Company is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 0.10% to 0.30% of the borrowing limit depending on the Company’s credit ratings (currently 0.125%). The Company had no balance outstanding on the Credit Facility at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company had $85.0 million outstanding on the Credit Facility in conjunction to the redemption of its 6.45% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series S. The Company had $539,000 and $769,000 of unamortized commitment fees as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Credit Facility requires the Company to meet certain covenants, all of which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2016. Interest on outstanding borrowings is payable monthly. 
 ﻿
 The Company has broad powers to borrow in furtherance of the Company’s objectives. The Company has incurred in the past, and may incur in the future, both short-term and long-term indebtedness to facilitate real estate acquisitions and other capital allocations.
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2016, the Company employed 157 individuals, primarily personnel engaged in property operations. 
 ﻿
 Insurance
 ﻿
 The Company believes that its properties are adequately insured. Facilities operated by the Company have historically been covered by comprehensive insurance, including fire, earthquake and liability coverage from nationally recognized carriers.
 ﻿
 Environmental Matters
 ﻿
 Compliance with laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those regarding the discharge of material into the environment, has not had any material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company.
