ITEM 1. | BUSINESS OF THE PARTNERSHIP
--------+----------------------------

 
Royal Hawaiian Orchards, L.P. (the “Partnership”) is a master limited partnership organized in 1986 under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Partnership is managed by its sole general partner, Royal Hawaiian Resources, Inc. (the “Managing Partner”). On October 1, 2012, the Partnership changed its name from ML Macadamia Orchards, L.P. to Royal Hawaiian Orchards, L.P. to better enable the Partnership to brand its products. Royal Hawaiian was the original brand name used to market the macadamia nuts grown from 1946 until 1973 on the acreage that now comprises our orchards. Bulk macadamia kernel and branded product sales are made through the Partnership’s wholly owned subsidiary, Royal Hawaiian Macadamia Nut, Inc. (“Royal”). Unless the context otherwise requires, Royal Hawaiian Orchards, L.P. and its subsidiaries are referred to in this report as the Partnership and “we,” “us” or “our.”
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 688 Kinoole Street, Suite 121, Hilo, Hawaii 96720, and our telephone number is (808) 747-8471. Our Depositary Units Representing Class A Units of Limited Partnership Interests (“Units”) are currently traded on the OTCQX platform under the symbol “NNUTU.”
 
Overview
 
We are a producer and distributor of high-quality macadamia nut-based products. We are the largest macadamia nut farmer in Hawaii, farming approximately 5,010 tree acres of orchards that we own or lease in two locations on the island of Hawaii, including 641 tree acres that we own and lease to another party. We also farm approximately 433 tree acres of macadamia orchards in Hawaii for other orchard owners. 
Business Segments
 
We have two business segments: orchards and branded products. The orchards segment derives its revenues from the sale of wet-in-shell (“WIS”) macadamia nuts, sale of dry-in-shell (“DIS”) macadamia nuts, sale of macadamia nut kernel to Royal, revenues from contract farming, and orchard lease income. The branded products segment derives its revenues from the sale of bulk macadamia kernel and, through 2017, of branded macadamia nut products by Royal.
 
Information concerning industry segments is set forth in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 4 – Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Orchards Segment
 
The orchards segment grows and farms macadamia nuts for sale as WIS and DIS, and for sale as macadamia nut kernel to Royal for the sale of bulk kernel and the processing and sale of branded products. The orchards segment also provides contract farming services and leases orchards. 
 
Most of our WIS nuts are dried, sent to a third-party processor for shelling and then sold as bulk kernel or used in our branded products. We also sell to Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation (“Mauna Loa”) pursuant to three long-term agreements, which represented approximately 23% and 18% of our production in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Nuts retained by us for use in our branded products segment are dried and then sent to a third-party processor for shelling.
 
Competition. Demand for macadamia nuts in the United States and Hawaii has been strong. Our nuts are sold to Royal, to Mauna Loa under long-term contracts and to processors, with and without contracts. We compete with other growers in Hawaii for labor and with processors for WIS nuts to process and sell through Royal.
 
Macadamia Farming. We farm approximately 5,010 tree acres of orchards that we own or lease, including 641 tree acres that we own and lease to another party. We also farm approximately 433 tree acres of macadamia orchards in Hawaii for other orchard owners.
 
All orchards are located in two separate regions on the island of Hawaii (“Keaau” and “Ka’u”). Because each region has different terrain and weather conditions, farming methods vary somewhat between the regions.

Branded Products Segment
 
Our branded products segment sells bulk kernel to customers throughout the world directly and through brokers and marketed branded products under the ROYAL HAWAIIAN ORCHARDS® brand name. In 2017, because of strong prices for bulk kernel and the need to generate cash flow, we reduced our investment in growing sales of branded products and focused on profitability and minimizing inventory balances. On February 28, 2018, we announced the sale of our branded products snack business. After close of the sale in March 2018, the branded products segment will focus exclusively on bulk macadamia kernel sales.
 
Customers. Royal sells bulk kernel to nut brokers and companies who use the kernel in their products. The branded products were sold to wholesale customers in the United States.
 
Competition. Our principal competitors in the sale of bulk macadamia kernel are sellers of macadamia kernel from Australia, South Africa and other macadamia producing countries. 
 
Environmental Matters. Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. We believe the Partnership is in compliance with all material environmental regulations affecting our facilities and operations.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
As an agricultural company, we are subject to extensive government regulation, including regulation of the manner in which we cultivate and fertilize as well as process our macadamia nuts. Furthermore, the branded products segment of our business subjects us to additional regulation regarding the manufacturing, distribution, and labeling of our products.
 
Manufacturers and marketers of food products are subject to extensive regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), and other national, state and local authorities. The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Food Safety Modernization Act and their regulations govern, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging and safety of foods. Under these acts, the FDA regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current “good manufacturing practices” regulations, imposes ingredient specifications and requirements for many foods, requires specialized training and record keeping to identify and prevent hazards within food production facilities, and inspects food facilities and issues recalls for tainted food products.
 
Food manufacturing facilities and products are also subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local authorities. State regulations are not always consistent with federal or other state regulations.
 
Seasonality
 
Macadamia nut production is very seasonal, with the largest quantities typically being produced and then inventoried from September through November, resulting in large inventories that will be converted into finished product and sold throughout the following year.
Significant Customers
 
Mauna Loa has historically been and still is our largest customer. WIS nut sales to Mauna Loa represented approximately 33% and 19% of our nut production in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, in both 2017 and 2016 Mauna Loa bought macadamia nut kernel. Sales of WIS nuts and kernel totaled $8.5 million in 2017 compared to $6.9 million in 2016 and represented 26% of net revenue in both 2017 and 2016. See Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. In 2017, two other customers, Golden Peanut Company, LLC and Specialty Commodities, Inc., both owned by Archer Daniels Midland Company, purchased bulk kernel which together represented 15% of net revenue.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 297 people: 83 full-time employees; 206 seasonal employees; and 8 part-time employees.  Of the total, 15 are in farming supervision and management, 267 are in production, maintenance and agricultural operations, 15 are in accounting and administration, and one in sales.
 
We are a party to two collective bargaining agreements with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (“ILWU”) Local 142. These agreements cover all production, maintenance and agricultural employees of the Ka’u and Keaau orchards. On January 8, 2017, we and ILWU Local 142 agreed to two new three-year contracts, which are effective June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2019. Although we believe that relationships with our employees and the ILWU are good, there is no assurance that we will be able to extend these agreements on terms satisfactory to us when they expire.

Taxation
 
The Partnership has a grandfathered tax status, which allows it to be treated as a partnership for tax purposes, even though it is publicly traded, provided that it pays a 3.5% federal tax on gross income from the active conduct of the trade and business of the Partnership. The Partnership will cease to be treated as a partnership for tax purposes if the Partnership engages in a substantially new line of business. A substantially new line of business conducted through a wholly owned corporate subsidiary of the Partnership is not deemed to be a new line of business for tax purposes. Accordingly, the Partnership manufactures, markets and sells its branded products through its wholly owned corporate subsidiary, Royal. Any income or gain the Partnership derives from transactions with Royal would be included in income or gain of the Partnership that would flow through to the unitholders. Conversely, tax losses in Royal may not be available to offset the taxable income of the Partnership. As a result, the Partnership may have income allocable to unitholders on which the unitholders are obligated to pay taxes yet have no cash available for distribution. See Item 1A – Risk Factors – Tax Risks of Owning Our Units - Our branded products line of business operates through a corporate subsidiary, which may result in increased taxes and – Your tax liability from the ownership of Units may exceed your distributions from the Partnership. The Partnership intends to maintain its status of being taxed as a partnership.

Recent Developments
 
Settlement Agreement with Olson Trust. The Partnership entered into a Definitive Terms of Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Edmund C. Olson as Trustee for the EDMUND C. OLSON TRUST No. 2 dated August 21, 1985 (the “Olson Trust”) on February 14, 2017. On February 22, 2018, the Partnership and Olson Trust completed substantially all of the transactions contemplated by the Settlement Agreement, with the exception of a couple of small parcels subject to legal partition. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Partnership gained ownership of 653 acres of land, which includes the land underlying 382 acres of its trees and the land underlying its husking and drying plants, and the Partnership will gain ownership of the land underlying its garage and field office upon completion of the partition of the parcel underlying those facilities. The Partnership relinquished 515 acres of leased land (the lease for 423 acres of which was scheduled to expire in 2034 and 92 acres of which was scheduled to expire in 2045), including 348 acres of trees, and 30 acres of owned land, including 24 acres of trees (collectively, the “Olson Settlement”). For additional details of the terms of the Settlement Agreement, see Item 3 – Legal Proceedings and Note 15 – Litigation Loss Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Sale of Brands and Macadamia Snack Business. On February 28, 2018, Royal entered into a definitive agreement to sell its brands and macadamia snack business to MacFarms, LLC (“MacFarms”). MacFarms will acquire from Royal all assets which are currently owned by Royal that are used in the marketing and retail sales of macadamia nuts under Royal’s trademark and trade-name brands, including but not limited to the ROYAL HAWAIIAN ORCHARDS® trademark, for 11,220,242 ordinary fully paid shares, approximately 13% of the issued shares, in Buderim Group Limited (ASX:BUG), the parent company of MacFarms. The Partnership will also enter into a supply agreement to sell kernel at international prices to MacFarms. In addition, the Partnership and MacFarms will enter agreements to process each other’s wet-in-shell nuts as needed and to explore a joint investment in a processing facility in Hawaii.
 
In 2012, the Partnership established Royal to sell its bulk kernel and to supply its newly developed line of macadamia snacks under the brand name ROYAL HAWAIIAN ORCHARDS®, which together made up its branded products segment. In the first half of 2017, the Partnership began focusing more on its bulk macadamia kernel business with sales into Europe, Asia and the US. With the sale of its brands and the macadamia snack business, the Partnership will focus on its orchard business and on sales of macadamia kernel from its orchards and other Hawaiian orchards to MacFarms and other customers worldwide at prices higher than can be obtained by selling wet-in-shell in Hawaii.
