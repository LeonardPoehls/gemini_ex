 OVERVIEW 
 Syntel, incorporated under Michigan law on April 15, 1980, is a global provider of digital transformation, information technology (IT) and knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) services to Global 2000 companies. 
 Effective the first quarter of 2014, as a result of the completion of organizational changes, the Company changed its basis of segmentation to industry segments as follows: 
 

 | Banking and Financial Services
--+-------------------------------


 | Healthcare and Life Sciences
--+-----------------------------


 | Insurance
--+----------


 | Manufacturing
--+--------------


 | Retail, Logistics and Telecom
--+------------------------------

 In each of our business segments, Syntel helps customers adapt to market change by providing a broad array of technology-based, industry-specific solutions. These solutions leverage Syntels strong understanding of the underlying trends and market forces in our chosen industry segments. These 
 
1 
 
 solutions are complemented by strong capabilities in Digital Modernization, Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud (SMAC) technologies, Business Intelligence (BI), Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO), application services, testing, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), IT Infrastructure Management Services (IMS), and business and technology consulting. 
 Banking and Financial Services 
 Our Banking and Financial Services segment serves financial institutions throughout the world. Our clients include companies providing banking, capital markets, cards and payments, investments and transaction processing services to third parties. Our clients engage us to help make their operations as effective, productive and cost-efficient as possible, and to support new capabilities. We assist these clients in such areas as: payment solutions, retail banking, wholesale banking, consumer lending, risk management, investment banking, reconciliation, fraud analysis, mobile banking, and compliance and securities services. The demand for our services in the banking and financial services sector is being driven by changing global regulatory requirements, customer interest in newer technology areas and related services such as digital modernization, and an ongoing focus on cost reduction and operational efficiencies. 
Healthcare and Life Sciences 
 Our Healthcare and Life Sciences segment serves healthcare payers, providers and pharmaceutical and medical device providers, among others. The healthcare industry is constantly seeking to improve the quality of care while managing the cost of care in order to make healthcare affordable to a larger population. Our healthcare practice focuses on providing a broad range of services and solutions to the industry across the consumer life cycle, which includes regulatory requirements, integrated care, stake holder engagement and wider use of electronic health records, among others. We also partner with clients to modernize their systems and processes to enable them to deal with the increasing consumer orientation of healthcare, such as support for individual mandates and the adoption of mobile and analytics solutions to improve access to health information and decision making by end consumers. 
 In the life sciences category, we partner with leading pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device companies, as well as providers of generics, animal health and consumer health products. Our life sciences solutions help transform many of the business processes in the life sciences value chain (research, clinical development, manufacturing and supply chain, and sales and marketing) as well as regulatory and administrative functions. 
 Insurance 
 We serve the needs of global property and casualty insurers, insurance brokers, personal, commercial, life and retirement insurance service providers. These customers turn to us for assistance in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations and in achieving business transformation. We focus on aspects of our clients operations, such as policy administration, claims processing and compliance reporting. We also serve the growing trend among insurers to improve their sales and marketing processes by deepening direct retail customer relationships and strengthening interactions with networks of independent and captive

 insurance agents. This is often accomplished through the use of digital front-end technologies like cloud, social media and mobile, and supported by modernization of applications and infrastructure elements. Additionally, many insurers seek to improve business effectiveness by reducing expense ratios and exiting non-core lines of business and operations. 
 Manufacturing 
 We provide technology services and business consulting in a range of sub-sectors including industrial products, aerospace and automotive manufacturing, as well as to processors of raw materials and natural resources. Demand for our services in this segment is being driven by trends that, among others, include the increasing globalization of sourcing and the desire of clients to further penetrate emerging markets, leading to longer and more complex supply chains. Some of our solutions for industrial and manufacturing clients include warranty management, dealer system integration, Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), Supply Chain Management (SCM), sales and operations planning, and mobility. 
Retail, Logistics and Telecom 
 In Retail, we serve a wide spectrum of retailers in specialty, apparel and home improvement segments. We also serve the travel and hospitality industry including airlines, hotels as well as online and travel retail, global distribution systems and intermediaries. Our domain intensive solutions transform customer/shopper experiences while keeping down the cost of IT operations. 
 In Logistics, our clients look to Syntel to implement business-relevant changes that will make them more productive, competitive and cost effective. To that end, we help organizations improve operational efficiencies, enhance responsiveness and collaborate with trading partners to better serve their markets and end customers. 
 In Telecom, we help our clients address important changes in the telecom industry, such as the transition to new network technologies, designing, developing, testing and introducing new products and channels, improving customer service and increasing customer satisfaction. 
 Syntels Retail Logistics and Telecom Business unit leverages its comprehensive understanding of the business and technology needs of the industry. Our industry solutions for our clients includes SCM, sales and operations planning, mobility, Point of Sale (POS) testing, omnichannel enablement and integration, web content management solutions, Sales force and cloud foundry enablement, among others. In addition, there is strong demand for digital modernization services across these industries to enhance efficiency and agility of their underlying technology systems. 
 INDUSTRY 
 The rapid pace of business change and technology innovation over the past several years has increased the urgency for corporations to modernize and transform their business processes and technology environments to remain competitive and adopt new digital business models.

Global 2000 companies are faced with a dual challenge: 
 

 | Manage and optimize Run the Business services, or IT and process outsourcing services that are primarily characterized by an emphasis on scale and cost factors. These services feature standardized business processes and promote a high level of stability.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Invest in Change the Business initiatives, which are transformational in nature and seek to achieve greater enterprise growth, speed and agility. These types of services require a focus on innovation, often involve dynamic requirements, and can create a high degree of organizational change.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Demand for IT services is driven by companies seeking ways to outsource not just specific projects for the design, development and integration of new technologies, but also ongoing management, maintenance and enhancement of existing IT systems. 
 Demand for KPO services is driven by enterprises going beyond IT outsourcing to drive cost reduction through outsourcing of business and knowledge processes. Companies are beginning to appreciate the benefits a KPO partner can deliver through increased efficiencies and service performance. 
 The companies best positioned to benefit from the demand for Run the Business initiatives have access to a pool of skilled professionals, a proven ability to manage IT and KPO programs, robust methodologies for managing transition, projects and risk, low-cost offshore software development facilities, and operational scalability to meet customer growth requirements. 
 Organizations seeking to Change the Business require an experienced outsourcing services provider with the expertise and knowledge to address the complexities of a rapidly changing technology landscape, along with the ability to understand their business processes and industry drivers. 
 In addition, globalization is an integral element of the business strategy of any Global 2000 corporation that seeks to balance their Run and Change needs. Services globalization enables companies to access a global pool of talent and capabilities to drive greater competiveness. A well-executed global services model delivers higher quality, lower cost, faster turnaround and responsive and customized service. 
 Syntels customer-centric approach delivers tangible value to clients through a flexible model that combines technology and business domain expertise to develop innovative solutions to solve unique business problems. Our organization is focused on and aligned to help customers strike the right balance between investing in new initiatives and optimizing and modernizing existing ones. 
 Syntels Customer for Life philosophy emphasizes flexibility, customer responsiveness, value focus and a tradition of delivery excellence. 
 During 2016, the Company provided services to 137 customers primarily in the U.S. and Europe. Syntel has been chosen as a preferred vendor by many of its customers and has been recognized for its quality and responsiveness. The Company seeks to develop long-term relationships with its customers in order to become a trusted business partner and expand its presence with current customers. Additionally, the Company believes that its domain expertise, breadth of services and strong alignment with client culture and business imperatives are important decision factors in Syntel being chosen as a preferred vendor.

The Company has an integrated sales and marketing approach that leverages a dedicated sales team to identify and acquire new accounts and work with engagement teams to expand and cross-sell within existing accounts. In addition, Syntels Strategic Sourcing Services group  formed in 2014  is tasked with pursuing and signing large outsourcing deals for the Company. 
 The Company believes that human resources are its most valuable asset and invests significantly in programs to recruit, train and retain technology and operations professionals. The Company recruits through a global recruiting network and maintains a broad package of employee support programs. Syntel believes that its management structure and human resources organization is designed to maximize the Companys ability to efficiently expand its professional staff in response to customer needs. As of December 31, 2016, Syntels worldwide billable headcount consisted of 17,192 professionals providing professional services to Syntels customers. 
 The information set forth under Note 16, Geographic Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the separate financial section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference. 
 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES 
 Syntel has developed proven and effective processes to handle large, complex engagements and efficiently deliver high quality IT and KPO solutions through a global delivery model. Management believes that Syntels Customer for Life philosophy, industry expertise, end-to-end service offerings, intellectual capital, commitment to client success, and global delivery model are key competitive advantages. 
 Customers for Life: The Company recognizes that its best source for new business opportunities comes from existing customers and believes its superior customer service is a differentiating factor resulting in Syntels high rate of repeat business. At engagement initiation, Syntels services are based on expertise in the software lifecycle and underlying technologies. Over time, however, as Syntel develops an in-depth knowledge of a customers business processes, applications and industry, Syntel gains a competitive advantage to perform additional higher-value services for that customer. 
 Deep Industry Expertise: Syntels mission statement is We create new opportunities for our clients by harnessing our talent, passion and innovation. The Company is focused on developing a strong understanding of its clients businesses to drive new opportunities that improve their business performance. Syntel has developed methodologies, toolsets and proprietary knowledge applicable to specific industries. Syntel combines deep industry knowledge with an understanding of its clients needs and technologies to provide high-value, high-quality services that are strongly linked to their underlying business. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Companys percentage of revenue by industry segment was 49%, 17%, 16%, 13% and 5% for banking and financial services, retail, logistics and telecom, healthcare and life sciences, insurance and manufacturing respectively. 
 
5 
 
Depth and Breadth of Technology Service Offerings: The Company provides a comprehensive range of technology services, including application development, application maintenance and support, packaged software implementation, infrastructure management services, architecture planning, KPO services, migration and testing services. Syntel has also invested in developing strong capabilities in digital technology areas including cloud computing, analytics, automation, mobility, modernization and business process management. This broad technology expertise is strongly complemented by the Companys focus, specialization and deep domain expertise in key industries. Syntels knowledge, experience, and technology expertise enables the Company to partner closely with its customers to address a range of pressing business needs. 
 Intellectual Capital: Over its 36-year history, Syntel has developed proven methodologies and practices, innovative accelerators, tools and utilities, reusable software assets, and technical expertise for the development, management and transformation of its customers information systems and business processes. 
The Company believes this intellectual capital enhances its ability to understand customer needs, design customized solutions and provide quality services in a timely and cost-effective manner. 
 The Company strives to continually enhance this knowledge base by creating competencies in emerging technical fields such as automation, big data analytics, cloud computing, mobile and embedded technologies, open source platforms, and social media. 
 Through these efforts, the Company delivers additional value to its clients, drives an expanded scope of work for existing customers, and creates greater efficiency in its own service delivery. 
 In order to protect the Companys intellectual property rights, the Company relies upon a combination of non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements as well as trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws. The Company enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, clients and potential clients, which limit access to and distribution of the Companys proprietary information. 
 Commitment to Client Success: Syntel aligns its objectives with those of its clients by committing to outcome-based delivery models such as fixed-price, fixed-time frame engagements. The Company also believes its ability to take ownership for its clients successes is an important competitive differentiator in the marketplace. The Company leverages its domain expertise, skilled technical resources and proprietary tools and methodologies to meet and exceed customer expectations on these engagements. 
 Global Delivery: Syntel performs its services on-site at customer locations, off-site at the Companys U.S. and European locations, and offshore at the Companys locations in Asia. By linking each of its service locations together through a dedicated data and voice network, Syntel provides a seamless service capability to its customers around the world, largely unconstrained by geographies, time zones and cultures. 
 Syntels Global Delivery Model gives the Company the flexibility to deliver to each customer a unique mix of on-site, off-site and offshore services to meet varying customer needs for direct interaction with Syntel personnel, access to technical and process expertise, resource availability and cost-effective delivery.

Benefits to clients include responsive delivery based on an in-depth understanding of client-specific processes and needs, quick turnaround, access to the most knowledgeable personnel and best practices, resource depth, 24-hour support seven days a week, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Syntel has Global Development Centers in Pune, Mumbai, Gurugram (previously known as Gurgaon) and Chennai, India; Glasgow, Scotland; Krakow, Poland; and Manila, Philippines. The Company has offsite development facilities in Phoenix, Arizona; Memphis, Tennessee; Nashville, Tennessee, and a support center in Cary, North Carolina to support the Companys Global Delivery Model. 
 BUSINESS STRATEGY 
 The Companys objective is to become a strategic partner with its customers in managing the full IT/KPO services lifecycle. The Company plans to continue to pursue the following strategies to achieve this objective: 
 Grow Application Services Through Close Alignment With Customer Challenges. Two notable business challenges faced by clients today are optimizing their Run the Business costs and freeing up resources to Change the Business. Syntel has aligned its delivery structure to create dedicated teams focused on developing and delivering value-added services that address this dual dynamic. The Companys Managed Services Organization encompasses Syntels application development, management, maintenance, digital modernization, IT infrastructure and testing practices, and is designed to deliver the services that run its clients businesses on a daily basis. Syntels Digital One practice executes digital transformation projects that deploy SMAC technologies to enable clients to leverage emerging technologies to open new markets and create competitive advantage. The Company has also invested significantly in additional sales and marketing resources, as well as hiring engagement and delivery personnel to develop proprietary solutions, accelerators and methodologies in support of these two service lines. 
 Expand Role with Current Customers and Add Select New Customers. Syntels emphasis on customer service and long-term relationships has enabled the Company to generate recurring revenues from existing customers. The Company also seeks to expand its customer base by leveraging its expertise in providing services to the financial services, healthcare, insurance, retail, logistics and telecom, and manufacturing industries. The Company is increasing its marketing efforts in other parts of the world, particularly in Europe. 
 Expand KPO Market. The Company will grow its expertise in the area of value-added KPO services, primarily in the areas of financial services, healthcare and insurance. By leveraging its proven Global Delivery Model and industry and technical expertise, the Company is able to deliver process improvements as well as provide high-value KPO services. In addition to offering its existing KPO services, the Company also seeks out potential new lines of service and leverages its investments in IP and automation technologies to deliver enhanced value to clients. 
 
7 
 
Attract and Retain Highly Skilled Professionals. The Company believes that employees are its most valuable asset, and that its success depends in large part upon the ability to attract, develop, motivate, retain and effectively utilize highly skilled professionals. Over the years, the Company has developed a worldwide recruiting network, logistical expertise to relocate its personnel, and programs for human resource retention and development.
The Company believes that its management structure and human resources organization is designed to maximize the Companys ability to efficiently expand its professional staff in response to customer needs. The Company believes that its investments in creating world-class campus facilities have positively impacted its ability to attract and retain high quality talent. 
 Leverage Global Delivery Model. The ability to deliver a seamless service capability virtually anywhere in the world from its domestic and offshore facilities gives the Company an effective ability to meet customer needs for technical and process expertise, best practice solutions, resource availability, scalability, responsive turnaround and cost-effective delivery. A significant proportion of the Companys services are delivered from offshore delivery locations. Measured by billable headcount, approximately 76% and 75% of services were delivered from offshore centers as of December 31, 2016 and as of December 31, 2015, respectively. 
 Pursue Selective Partnership Opportunities. The Company has entered into partnership alliances with several software firms and IT application infrastructure firms. The alliances provide a strong software implementation strategy for the customer, combining the partners software with Syntels extensive implementation and delivery capabilities. Before entering into a partnership alliance, the Company considers a number of criteria, including: the technology employed, the industry served, the projected product lifecycle, the size of the potential market, the products integration requirements, and the reputation of the potential partner. 
SERVICE OFFERINGS 
 Syntel provides a broad range of technology solutions to its customers, including Managed IT Services, Digital One® and KPO services. 
 Through its Managed Services offering, the Company provides complete software applications development, maintenance, digital modernization, testing, IT infrastructure, cloud and migration services. The Companys SyntBots® automation platform delivers robust, reusable automation capabilities that enhance the productivity and quality of its Managed Services offerings.

 Through its KPO service offerings, the Company provides a host of high value outsourced solutions for knowledge and business processes. 
 Syntels focus on customer service is evidenced by the high level of repeat business from existing customers and the performance and quality 
 
8 
 
 awards its customers have bestowed on Syntel. During 2016, approximately 99% of Syntels revenue came from clients the Company has worked with for at least one year. Syntel has earned recognition for its quality and innovation from a host of clients in a variety of industries. Syntels development centers in India were assessed at the highest possible quality rating of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Capability Maturity Model (CMM)  Level 5. Syntel is also an ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 27001:2013 certified company and has achieved SSAE 16 Type II Certification. 
 Managed Services 
 Syntel provides end-to-end Run the Business services to its clients across all industries through its Managed Services offering. The goal of Managed Services is to create new sources of value from existing client technology investments by moving to as-a-service models. Syntels Managed Services Organization was created in 2014 by combining groups responsible for application services, testing, IT infrastructure, migration and cloud computing services. The Managed Services Organization has been further strengthened by investments in service capabilities and intellectual property that reflect customer needs. 
 Through application services, Syntel assumes responsibility for and manages the complete lifecycle of development, management and maintenance of business applications. Along with application services, Syntels Managed Services Organization also provides a suite of complementary service offerings such as testing, IT infrastructure services, cloud computing and digital modernization. Syntels digital modernization solutions leverage an automated approach to enable the seamless adoption of new technologies and to ensure interoperability between a customers new and existing technology investments. 
 The Managed Services offering is designed to drive greater efficiency, agility and client satisfaction through integrated and automated delivery of application and infrastructure services in an industrialized model. 
 Syntel has developed methodologies, processes and tools to effectively integrate and execute Managed Services engagements. The key enabler of Syntels Managed Services offering is the Companys proprietary MIII: ManageMigrateModernize offering. MIII enables clients to objectively examine their existing technology investments and make informed decisions about which applications should be managed as-is, which could benefit from migration to a different system or platform, and which should be modernized to newer technologies. The Companys MIII offering is powered by the SyntBots automation platform, which enhances the efficiency and quality of this offering. 
 The Global Delivery Model is central to Syntels delivery of Managed Services. It enables the Company to respond to client needs for ongoing service and flexibility, and has provided the capability to become productive quickly on a cost-effective basis to meet timing and resource demands for mission-critical applications. 
 Because delivering Managed Services typically involves close participation in the IT strategy of a customers organization, Syntel adjusts the manner in which it delivers these services to meet the specific needs of each customer. For example, if the customers business requires fast delivery of a mission-critical applications update, Syntel will combine its on-site professionals, who have knowledge of the customers business processes and 
 
9 
 
 applications, together with its global infrastructure to deliver around-the-clock resources. If the customers need is for cost reduction, Syntel may increase the portion of work performed at its offshore Global Development Centers, which has significantly lower costs. The Company believes that its ability to provide flexible service, delivery and access to resources permits responsiveness to customer needs and are important factors that distinguish its Managed Services from other IT service firms. 
 The Company believes its approach to providing these services and its commitment to improved business outcomes results in a long-term collaborative relationship with customers. 
 Digital One®
The Company believes that digital technologies are a disruptive force that affects every industry. Digital One enables clients to adopt and leverage digital technologies for business transformation. By combining expertise in digital technologies with industry knowledge, Digital One helps clients use data as a strategic asset to gain deep business insights, create a highly integrated enterprise, deliver a superior customer experience, and create business value in the Digital Economy. 
 Syntels Digital One service line centralizes the delivery of digital architecture, web and mobile applications, user experience, Big Data, analytics, social and IoT services. It has since expanded to include enterprise architecture, data warehousing and business intelligence, complex event processing (CEP), Microservices, EAI, EDM, BPM and ERP offerings. 
 Through data warehousing, business intelligence, Big Data Analytics and enterprise data management (EDM), Syntel helps customers harness their data assets, turn them into real business value, and make more strategic use of information within their businesses. 
 The goal of Digital One is to: 
 

 | enable clients to go to market and create new sources of revenue with products and services,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | gain profound insights into their businesses and customers,
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 | provide the agility and scalability to incorporate new technologies,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 | modernize to support future expansion and growth.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 The Companys marketing initiatives cover traditional and digital channels to connect and engage with customers and prospects. Digital channels include the corporate website, social media channels and webinars. Offline channels include direct marketing campaigns, presence in conferences, events, public relations activities and maintenance of strong relationships with industry trade groups, industry analysts and sourcing advisory firms.

 Talent Acquisition: The Company has developed a robust recruiting methodology over the years, with campus hiring as the prime focus area. The Company has significantly expanded its global recruiting team, with recruiters in the U.S., Europe, the Philippines, and at offices across India working to recruit candidates with the right mix of skills and experience to support its global customer base. 
 Talent Management: The Company seeks to provide meaningful development and advancement opportunities to its employees, which the Company believes leads to improved employee retention and better customer service.

 Management training covers a range of topics that include project management, leadership development, and soft skills like communication, business etiquette and public speaking.

 Competition also arises from geographies such as Eastern Europe and the Philippines, as well as from smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which Syntel operates.
