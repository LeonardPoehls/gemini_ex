BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
 
Integral Technologies, Inc. ("Integral," the "Company" or "we") is, incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 12, 1996.  To date, we have expended resources on the research and development of several different types of technologies.
 
Integral focuses the majority of its resources on researching, developing and commercializing its ElectriPlast® technologies. The technology possesses a multitude of applications in a myriad of industries. These include the auto industry, the aerospace, consumer electronics, and commercial aviation industries, among others. One key factor that could drive demand for ElectriPlast is the need for light-weighting. Automotive and aerospace are leading the way to achieve reduced emissions and increased fuel economy. Light-weighting involves the substitution of lighter materials, often times using carbon-fiber based, for heavier (aluminum and other metals) materials.
 
On May 21, 2010, President Obama asked the EPA and NHTSA to jointly develop a national program that would “produce a new generation of clean vehicles,” to lower oil usage. The government has mandated that auto manufacturers comply with CAFÉ (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards by the year 2025. To become more energy efficient, auto manufacturers are required to have their fleets achieving 54.5 MPG (miles per gallon) by then. According to a 2009 issue of Car and Driver Magazine, in 2009, car fleets averaged 32.5 CAFE MPG and trucks averaged 24.5 MPG. The Obama administration’s mandate is expected to nearly double fuel efficiency by 2025.
 
We apply a significant portion of our resources to the protection of our intellectual property through patent filings. One source of income will be from up-front licensing fees as is the case with our manufacturing license agreement for the use of our patents and proprietary “know-how” for the manufacture of the ElectriPlast® pellets by Hanwha Advanced Materials Co., Ltd. (“Hanwha”) of Korea. In addition, Integral allocates resources to expand and protect the extensive intellectual property holdings surrounding its ElectriPlast® technology. Integral’s business strategy focuses on the leveraging of its intellectual property rights and our strength in product design and material innovation. Integral is focusing its business development and marketing efforts on securing licensing and/or joint development agreements in areas for which it currently hold patents covering specific materials, components, parts, applications or end-products incorporating conductive resins and ElectriPlast technology. Integral collaborates with suppliers, Tier1 vendors, OEM's and manufacturers of products who would benefit from the incorporation of any of the ElectriPlast® applications.
 
Our business model calls for the Company to generate revenue from license fees from the use of our patent portfolio and proprietary “know-how”, to generate revenue through the sale of ElectriPlast® material either through a royalty revenue stream or from direct sales of ElectriPlast®, and by providing technical services through our Detroit Tech Center to companies needing our expertise in applying ElectriPlast® in their applications. The Company’s management and engineering team has expertise and know-how in the ideas related to the use of the product.
 
Various examples of applications for ElectriPlast® where Integral holds patent protection are: batteries, antennas, electronics shielding, lighting/LED circuitry, motors, switch actuators, resistors, medical devices, thermal management, toys and cable connector bodies, among others. We have been working to introduce these new applications and the ElectriPlast® technology on a global scale.
 
In particular, our business model calls for collaborating with leading resin and fiber suppliers, manufacturers, and technology innovators to manufacture ElectriPlast®, and develop new product applications for ElectriPlast® . We anticipate that these relationships will lead to greater market penetration and adoption for our products. In view of these goals, we have recently formed relationships with BASF, Chang Rim Eng Inc., Delphi Automotive PLC, Advanced Battery Concepts, The Ultimate Battery Co., LeddarTech, TheMix Plastics, Inc., and Hanwha, and believe that we now have several key global relationships to help us expand our operations both domestically and internationally.

During the fiscal year, several actions were taken by the Company to better position the commercialization of ElectriPlast. The Company continued to emphasize the expansion of ElectriPlast's technical and engineering capabilities. Earlier in 2015, the Company filed non-provisional patents associated with its bipolar battery technology and bipolar plate products.  The Company believes the bipolar battery plate and associated power storage technology provides long-sought breakout weight savings and performance benefits for the lead-acid battery market. The company intends to develop the power storage technology as an Integral Technologies business unit and will seek partners to fully develop batteries for consumer and industrial consumption.  The world-wide market demand for lead-acid batteries was estimated to be $44.7B in 2014, and expected to grow to $58.6B by 2020 (a 5% CAGR).  The company intends to develop the bipolar battery as an ElectriPlast business unit and will seek partners to fully develop batteries for consumer and industrial consumption. 
 
To expedite the commercialization and monetization of the battery technology, the company may consider investment or acquire other battery companies, sell all or part of the plate technology business unit, and / or merge the business unit with another company.  The first prototype battery utilizing the ElectriPlast bipolar technology was produced in 2015.  The battery was produced with the assistance of Advanced Battery Concepts.   Based on the initial prototype and a series of discussion during the quarter, the Company announced on April 26, 2016 a Joint Technology Assessment Program with Advanced Battery Concepts, an industry leader in large format bi-polar battery design and manufacture.
 
In Asia, the Company, through its newly signed reseller agreement, provided conductive material containing nickel-plated carbon fiber material to Hanwha for prototype development for a major auto manufacturer based in Asia that is developing six (6) new applications. The Company continues to support Chang Rim Eng Inc. (“Chang Rim”) as it readies to commercialize ElectriPlast® in South Korea. The Company announced on October 8, 2014 that Chang Rim had successfully completed its prototype phase for a motor casing targeting the domestic Asia automotive market. On August 20, 2015, the Company announced with Chang Rim the largest ElectriPlast order in the Company’s history.  The company continues to make progress in shielding in the electric vehicle market.  During the quarter, the Company provided ElectriPlast material and applications support to a Tier 1 company for finalizing an application for an electric vehicle. The company has been approved as a supplier for the domestic Tier 1 for the purpose of supplying ElectriPlast for a specific electric vehicle platform expected to go into production in 2017.  The company expects initial commercial orders to be produced in the second half of 2017.
 
On March 9, 2015 the Company announced the completion of the relocation of its North American manufacturing from Jasper to Evansville, Indiana to prepare the foundation for expected manufacturing growth.  In conjunction with long time manufacturing partner Jasper Rubber Products, the manufacturing is now taking place at the Nova Polymers facility in Evansville, IN.  In addition to relocating the line, additional capacity was added by dedicating existing Nova fixed assets to the ElectriPlast process which will increase capacity by ten times when fully implemented.  Nova was selected because they provide the necessary infrastructure for scaling manufacturing capacity to meet the expected growth in customer volumes through 2020 and beyond.
 
During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, several steps were taken by the Company to mature certain client relationships and applications while also addressing on-going funding requirements. The Company signed a global Reseller and Marketing Agreement with a leading nickel-plating carbon fiber manufacturer dated March 1, 2016. The agreement provides exclusivity for certain major customer(s) with a provision for expanding the exclusivity rights to the Company. Nickel-plated carbon fiber is a key conductive material in the making of ElectriPlast® and the Company will pursue other opportunities that strengthens its relationship with key suppliers.
 
Companies continue to incorporate ElectriPlast in their on-going product development evaluations.  On March 30, 2016, the Company announced that LeddarTech includes ElectriPlast material to produce lens barrels in its latest release of its LeddarOne Sensing Module, a compact and low-cost lidar that provides valuable presence detection and distance measurement capabilities to a wide range of finished products.  In the announcement, LeddarTech highlighted the superior qualities of ElectriPlast in the key areas of weight-reduction, cost, and robustness in the demanding environment of drone aircraft.

In January 2016, the Company and a Tier 1 partner reached a technical milestone when its wire shielding application currently under development obtained the highest shielding effectiveness to date. The Company believes the level of shielding effectiveness validates the commercial viability of the technology. The companies have completed subsequent trials and continue to work towards commercialization for an effective alternative in replacing the more-costly metal, braided shielding.
 
The Company entered into a term sheet dated April 19, 2015 with a conductive plastics compounder (the “Compounder”) for the purpose of acquiring all the assets of the Compounder, with the Compounder remaining a separate entity. The Compounder is a niche supplier with an international customer base. The Company’s strategic interest in the Compounder is its equipment and expertise in conductive material compounding, as well as its customer base. The term sheet contemplated that upon the closing, all sales and marketing would be performed by the Company, and the Compounder would become the sole manufacturer for the Company. In October 2015, the founder and majority shareholder of the Compounder died from an accident before the transaction could be completed. A Special Administrator has been assigned to the deceased’s estate but the final disposition of the Compounder is unclear. Subsequently, all manufacturing employees left the Compounder and its customers turned to other suppliers.
 
During 3rd and 4th quarter, the Company was able to make product for the Compounder through a combination of using former employees of the Compounder as well as the Company’s own staff.  Also during the year, the Compounder’s landlord filed a “Pay or Leave” eviction notice to the Compounder for unpaid rent, which remains unsettled. The landlord also acquired all the manufacturing equipment and inventory used by the Compounder owned by a third party. The Company is in the process of acquiring all the landlord’s rights to the equipment and inventory, and if successful, plans to relocate the equipment and inventory to its Evansville manufacturing location.
 
On November 16, 2015, the Company entered into an oral understanding with a global manufacturing company (the “Licensee”) regarding certain exclusive and non-exclusive licensing rights to the Company’s existing ElectriPlast technology. The oral understanding agreed upon between the parties included various business terms involving the licensing of the Company’s technology, including, but not limited to, license fees, the scope of the license, the territory of the license and ownership of any products. After this oral understanding was reached between the parties, the Company received documentation from the Licensee which it believes did not accurately reflect the business terms which had previously been agreed to. The Company is currently working with the Licensee to work though the discrepancies in the business terms that were previously agreed to so definitive documentation can be executed between the parties. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the proposed arrangement is subject to, among other things, approval of the board of directors of both parties and execution of definitive documentation. Both companies remain interested in completing the transactions contemplated by this arrangement will be consummated prior to the end of the year; however, there can be no assurance that the transactions described above will ever be consummated.
 
A key priority for the Company is to build and expand the reach of its business development activities, as well as enhance the quality of its internal governance mechanisms.  On July 7, 2016 the Company announced the addition of Jeffrey A. Babka to its Board of Directors and Chairman of the Audit Committee.  Babka is a Venture Partner at Insight Venture Partners (“Insight”). Prior to his position at Insight, Babka served as Chief Financial Officer of NOMi Corporation, an in-store analytics provider.  Prior to NOMi, Babka served as Chief Financial Officer of Applied Predictive Technologies, a cloud-based predictive analytics company, which was acquired by MasterCard Inc. in May 2015.
 
On January 13, 2016 the Company announced the addition of Douglas R. Mathias (“Mathias”) to its Board of Directors.  Mathias is the President and CEO of Jasper Rubber, which specializes in the mixing and manufacture of Rubber, TPE, and Plastic components for the Filtration, Automotive, and Appliance Industries.  Concurrently, William Ince resigned from the Board.

TECHNOLOGIES
 
ElectriPlast®
 
We have researched and developed an innovative, electrically and thermally conductive resin-based material called “ElectriPlast®.” The ElectriPlast® polymer is a compounded formulation of resin-based materials that are conductively loaded, or doped, with a proprietary-controlled, balanced concentration of micron conductive materials, and then pelletized using our patented manufacturing process. The conductive loading or doping within this pellet is then homogenized using conventional molding techniques and conventional molding equipment. The end result is a product that can be molded into any of the infinite shapes and sizes associated with plastics, is non-corrosive, and can serve as an electrically conductive alternative material to metal.
 
ElectriPlast® is a patented non-corrosive, durable, conductive plastic pellet that replaces the metallic component currently used for shielding and conductive devices, thus creating applications never before possible and with a 40-60% weight reduction. ElectriPlast's® intellectual property rights and 55 issued patents, of which 51 of those patents not yet expired, and 10 pending applications cover both the material and its applications.
 
Various examples of applications for ElectriPlast® include antennas, EMI shielding, lighting circuitry, switch actuators, resistors, batteries, medical devices, thermal management and cable connector bodies, among many others. We have been working to introduce these new applications and the ElectriPlast® technology on a global scale.
 
The ElectriPlast® intellectual property (IP) portfolio is the centerpiece of Integral’s strategy to aggressively develop, protect, and market its innovations. Integral’s patent holdings encompass a broad range of ElectriPlast® developments which extend beyond the core technology to include key applications, and manufacturing processes
 
ElectriPlast® can be fabricated into virtually any shape or dimension using low-cost capital investment equipment, such as injection molding and extrusion versus high cost stamping methods. Its design flexibility, shorter development cycle and speed of manufacturing create a valuable market edge for customers.
 
Jasper Rubber Products, Inc. and Nova Polymers, are Integral’s US manufacturing partners of its proprietary ElectriPlast® product line (“Jasper”) (www.jasperrubber.com), and Hanwha is the Korean manufacturer.
 
Nova brings over thirty years of experience in the custom compounding of engineering resins.  Nova manufacturing and engineering resources includes an on-site lab which is a critical component in providing the required mechanical testing for ElectriPlast.

Patents/Trademarks on Technologies
 
Our intellectual property portfolio consists of over fourteen years of accumulated research and design knowledge and trade secrets.  We have sought United States (“US”) patent protection for many of our ideas related to our ElectriPlast® technologies.  Currently, we have filed 117 non-provisional US patent applications, 55 of which have been issued as patents, with 51 of those issued patents not yet expired.  No assurances can be given that all patent applications will be approved; however, to the extent that patents are not granted, we will continue to attempt to commercialize these technologies without the protection of patents.  As patents are issued, we will have the exclusive right to use and license the design(s) described in each issued patent for the life of the patent in the US.
 
Of the 117 non-provisional applications filed that have not issued as patents, 9 are currently pending, and 53 are no longer pending.  Integral continues to pursue intellectual property protection through its patent and trademark portfolio while constantly evaluating its filings to judiciously apply resources to our most critical technologies.  Integral has filed 12 Canadian patent applications, 2 of which have issued, with 10 no longer being active.  Integral has filed an International patent application, which published on September 25, 2014, claiming features of the Company’s capsule.  Subsequent to the year end the Company filed national stage applications based on this PCT on September 15, 2015 in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, China, Japan, South Korea, Europe, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, India, Thailand, Philippines, Singapore and Australia.

Product Manufacturing and Distribution
 
We are currently in limited manufacturing associated with the compounded product catalog and ElectriPlast pellets for domestic and international customers. As demand continues to grow and our need to increase capacity, reduce manufacturing costs and to improve margins, we would consider either more direct investment into the manufacturing business or adding one or more foundry partners, including the possibility of acquiring existing assets or an operating company to help us accelerate this process. We have entered into a non-exclusive manufacturing agreement with Jasper Rubber and Nova Polymers, discussed herein, which provide for Jasper and Nova to manufacture ElectriPlast® for us.
 
In March 2016, the Company contacted a customer of the Compounder, who consumes conductive plastics manufactured in a compounding process, and was able to negotiate a new order for the Compounder. The Company, through a combination of using former employees of the Compounder as well as the Company’s own staff, was able to make the material for the order, as well as other subsequent orders for other customers. Also during the year, the Compounder’s landlord filed a “Pay or Leave” eviction notice to the Compounder for unpaid rent, which remains unsettled. The landlord also acquired all the manufacturing equipment and inventory used by the Compounder owned by a third party. The Company is in the process of acquiring all the landlord’s rights to the equipment and inventory, and if successful, plans to relocate the equipment and inventory to its Evansville manufacturing location.
 
Working with Jasper and Nova, we have refined the manufacturing and molding process of ElectriPlast®. The relocation of the current manufacturing from the Jasper Rubber Products facility to Nova Polymers began in the fall of 2014, and was completed early in early 2015.   In addition to relocating the line, additional capacity was added by dedicating existing Nova fixed assets to the ElectriPlast process which will increase capacity by ten times when fully implemented.  Nova was selected because they provide the necessary infrastructure for scaling manufacturing capacity to meet the expected growth in customer volumes through 2020 and beyond.
 
In June 2013, we signed a 10-year agreement with Hanwha that grants Hanwha an exclusive right to sell, distribute and manufacture ElectriPlast® in South Korea. Additionally, Hanwha has acquired non-exclusive sales and distribution rights to ElectriPlast® in Japan, Taiwan and China. Hanwha is part of the Hanwha Group of companies that collectively form one of the largest conglomerates in South Korea, and is a global supplier in both automotive and consumer goods materials.
 
As an engineered raw material, our technologies will not be sold directly to the general public, but rather to businesses and manufacturers of certain products who will incorporate our technologies as components in the design of their end-products. In addition to our current relationships, we are also exploring other opportunities for potential global partnerships in the automotive industry, as well as other industries, including consumer electronics, cable and wire, and telecommunications.
 
Barriers to Entry into Market Segment
 
We have been working to introduce the ElectriPlast® technology as an alternative to metal for use as an electrically conductive material. Although gaining rapidly, little industry knowledge exists today regarding the science and use of conductive resins as an alternative material or how to apply the material to specific applications. As with any new technology, a prospective client must first become educated on the uses of the material, then investigate, test, trial and accept that the alternative material is an adequate, to superior cost effective replacement option. Until there is greater knowledge and broader acceptance of ElectriPlast as a viable metal replacement technology, we will continue to experience prolonged selling cycles.
