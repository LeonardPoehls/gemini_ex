Intellectual Property

We regard patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property as important to our success, and we rely on them globally to protect our investments in products and technology. Our patents expire at various times, but we believe that the loss or expiration of any individual patent would not materially affect our business. We, like other companies in the industries in which we operate, may be subject to claims of alleged infringement of the patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights of third parties from time to time.
Seasonal Factors

We historically experience stronger sales and income in our second, third, and fourth quarters, comprised of the three-month periods ending May 31, August 31, and November 30. Our performance in the first quarter (December through February) has historically been impacted by generally lower levels of customer manufacturing, construction, and refurbishment activities during the holidays and cold weather months.
Environmental Matters

Our business operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations.

As of November 30, 2016, the Company employed approximately 2,100 employees globally. Approximately 9.9% of the Company’s U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Raw Materials

Our Performance Chemicals segment utilizes a variety of raw materials, primarily monomers, in the manufacture of our products. Most of these raw materials have been, and we expect will continue to be, generally available from multiple suppliers. Monomer costs are a major component of the emulsion polymers produced by this segment. Key monomers include butadiene, styrene, acrylates, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate and vinyl pyridine. These monomers represented approximately 57% of Performance Chemicals’ total raw materials purchased on a dollar basis in 2016 for this segment.

Our Engineered Surfaces segment utilizes a variety of raw materials that are generally available from multiple suppliers. Key raw materials include polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins, textiles, plasticizers, paper, and titanium dioxide. PVC resins, plasticizers, and textiles represented approximately 57% of Engineered Surfaces’ total raw materials purchased on a dollar basis in 2016 for this segment.

The cost of raw materials has a significant impact on our profitability. We generally attempt to respond to raw material cost increases through productivity programs and price increases to our customers. The success of attempted price increases depends on a variety of factors including the specific market application and competitive environment. Under certain circumstances, we are not able to pass along some or all of the increase. In addition, if accepted by customers, price increases generally lag the increase in raw material costs. Index pricing applies to approximately 42% of Performance Chemicals' sales.
