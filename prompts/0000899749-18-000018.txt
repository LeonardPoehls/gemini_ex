Item 1. Business
Overview
Healthcare Realty Trust Incorporated (“Healthcare Realty” or the “Company”) is a self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that owns, leases, manages, acquires, finances, develops and redevelops income-producing real estate properties associated primarily with the delivery of outpatient healthcare services throughout the United States. The Company was incorporated in Maryland in 1992 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1993.
The Company operates so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, the Company is not subject to corporate federal income tax with respect to taxable income distributed to its stockholders. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for a discussion of risks associated with qualifying as a REIT.
Real Estate Properties
The Company had gross investments of approximately $3.8 billion in 201 real estate properties, construction in progress, land held for development and corporate property at December 31, 2017. The Company provided property management services for 160 healthcare-related properties nationwide, totaling approximately 11.5 million square feet as of December 31, 2017. The Company’s real estate property investments by geographic area are detailed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

See "Trends and Matters Impacting Operating Results" as part of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of this report for additional information regarding the Company's leases and leasing efforts.
Liquidity
The Company believes that its liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy its cash requirements. The Company expects to meet its liquidity needs through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, property dispositions, equity and debt issuances in the public or private markets and borrowings under commercial credit facilities.
Business Strategy
The Company owns and operates properties that facilitate the delivery of healthcare in primarily outpatient settings. To execute its strategy, the Company engages in a broad spectrum of integrated services including leasing, management, acquisition, financing, development and redevelopment of such properties. The Company seeks to generate stable, growing income and lower the long-term risk profile of its portfolio of properties by focusing on facilities located on or near the campuses of acute care hospitals associated with leading health systems. The Company seeks to reduce financial and operational risk by owning properties in diverse geographic locations with a broad tenant mix that includes over 30 physician specialties, as well as surgery, imaging, cancer and diagnostic centers. 
2017 Investment Activity
The Company acquired 15 medical office buildings and increased its ownership interest in an existing medical office building during 2017 for a total purchase price of $327.2 million. This includes the assumption of mortgage notes payable of $45.8 million and the acquisition of equity interests in limited liability companies that own two parking garages in Atlanta, Georgia. The weighted average capitalization rate for these investments was 5.4%. The Company calculates the capitalization rate for an acquisition as the forecasted first year net operating income divided by the purchase price plus acquisition costs and expected first year capital additions.
The Company disposed of 10 properties during 2017 for a total sales price of $122.7 million, including $84.0 million for four inpatient rehabilitation facilities. The weighted average capitalization rate for these 10 properties was 7.0%. The Company calculates the capitalization rate for dispositions as the next 12 months forecasted net operating income divided by the sales price.
In 2017, the Company funded $32.3 million toward development and redevelopment of properties, with one redevelopment and one development project underway at December 31, 2017.

See the Company's discussion regarding the 2017 acquisitions and dispositions activity in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and development activity in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, please refer to the Company's discussion in "Trends and Matters Impacting Operating Results" as part of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of this report.
Competition
The Company competes for the acquisition and development of real estate properties with private investors, healthcare providers, other REITs, real estate partnerships and financial institutions, among others. The business of acquiring and developing new healthcare facilities is highly competitive and is subject to price, construction and operating costs, and other competitive pressures. Some of the Company's competitors may have lower costs of capital.
The financial performance of all of the Company’s properties is subject to competition from similar properties. The extent to which the Company’s properties are utilized depends upon several factors, including the number of physicians using or referring patients to an associated healthcare facility, healthcare employment, competitive systems of healthcare delivery, and the area’s population, size and composition. Private, federal and state health insurance programs and other laws and regulations may also have an effect on the utilization of the properties. The Company’s properties operate in a competitive environment, and patients and referral sources, including physicians, may change their preferences for a healthcare facility from time to time.
Government Regulation
The facilities owned by the Company are utilized by medical tenants which are required to comply with extensive regulation at the federal, state and local levels, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "Affordable Care Act") and laws intended to combat fraud and waste such as the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law, False Claims Act and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. These laws and regulations establish, among other things, requirements for state licensure and criteria for medical tenants to participate in government-sponsored reimbursement programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Company's leases generally require the tenant to comply with all applicable laws relating to the tenant's use and occupation of the leased premises. Although lease payments to the Company are not directly affected by these laws and regulations, changes in these programs or the loss by a tenant of its license or ability to participate in government-sponsored reimbursement programs could have a material adverse effect on the tenant's ability to make lease payments to the Company.
The Medicare and Medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent evaluation and change. Government healthcare spending has increased over time; however, changes from year to year in reimbursement methodology, rates and other regulatory requirements may cause the profitability of providing care to Medicare and Medicaid patients to decline, which could adversely affect tenants' ability to make lease payments to the Company.
The Affordable Care Act was intended to provide for comprehensive reform of the United States' healthcare system and extend health insurance benefits to the uninsured population, with a mandate for individuals to purchase health coverage, and the potential to alleviate high uncompensated care expense to healthcare providers. However, the law also increased regulatory scrutiny of providers and insurers by federal and state administrative authorities; lowered annual increases in Medicare payment rates; and implemented cost-saving measures and shared risk-and-reward payment models to promote value and savings, rather than payment based solely on volume of services. These initiatives may slow the growth of healthcare spending over time, but also require providers to expand access and quality of care, presenting the industry and its individual participants with uncertainty and greater financial risk.
In 2017, the Affordable Care Act was subject to numerous legal and legislative challenges. While efforts in Congress to repeal the law were unsuccessful, President Trump's administration moved forward with an agenda to decrease the law's regulations, eliminate the individual insurance mandate penalty starting in 2019, end cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers for lower-income federal exchange enrollees, and increase states' flexibility to offer short-term, basic insurance plans. These initiatives could affect the market for individual health insurance and, consequently, the demand for healthcare services. The Company cannot predict the degree to which any changes may affect indirectly the economic performance of the Company, or its tenants, positively or negatively.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") continued to monitor physician Medicare rates in 2017 for reimbursement “site-neutrality,” or equalizing Medicare rates across different facility-type settings. Section 603 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 lowered Medicare rates effective January 1, 2017 for services provided in off-campus, provider-based outpatient departments to the same level of rates for physician-office settings for those facilities not grandfathered-in under the current Medicare rates as of the law's date of enactment, November 2, 2015. While these changes are expected to lessen reimbursement disparity between off-campus medical office and outpatient facilities, the Company’s medical office

buildings that are located on hospital campuses could become more valuable as hospital tenants will keep their higher Medicare rates for on-campus outpatient services. However, the Company cannot predict the amount of benefit from these measures or if other federal health policy or regulation will ultimately require cuts to reimbursement rates for services provided in other facility-type settings. The Company cannot predict the degree to which these changes, or changes to federal healthcare programs in general, may affect the economic performance of some or all of the Company's tenants, positively or negatively. 
In 2018, physicians must begin reporting patient data on quality and performance measures that will affect their Medicare payments for the year 2020. Implementation of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), unless amended in future legislation, will eventually replace the traditional fee-for-service payment model for physicians with a new value-based payment initiative. The CMS exempted approximately two-thirds of physician practices from MACRA compliance in 2018, citing high costs of implementation with minimal yield in savings, especially for smaller practices. MACRA compliance, and the ongoing debate over the most effective payment system to use to promote value-based reimbursement, present the industry and its individual participants with uncertainty and financial risk. The Company cannot predict the degree to which any such changes may affect the economic performance of the Company's tenants or indirectly the Company. 
Legislative Developments 
Each year, legislative proposals for health policy are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, and regulatory changes are enacted by government agencies. These proposals, individually or in the aggregate, could significantly change the delivery of healthcare services, either nationally or at the state level, if implemented. Examples of significant legislation or regulatory action recently enacted or in the process of implementation include: 

• | the legislation informally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, signed into law at the end of the year, affects healthcare providers and health systems in a variety of ways, positively and negatively, including by limiting their ability to deduct interest on debt, denying deductions for and imposing an excise tax on the compensation in excess of $1 million of the five most highly-compensated employees of health systems, and eliminating, in 2019, the tax penalty for the Affordable Care Act’s individual health insurance mandate;


• | the expansion of Medicaid benefits and the implementation of health insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act, whether run by the state or by the federal government, whereby individuals and small businesses purchase health insurance, including government-funded plans, many assisted by federal subsidies that are subject to ongoing legal and legislative challenges;


• | quality control, cost containment, and value-based payment system reforms for Medicaid and Medicare, such as expansion of pay-for-performance criteria, bundled provider payments, accountable care organizations, increased patient cost-sharing, geographic payment variations, comparative effectiveness research, and lower payments for hospital readmissions;


• | implementation of MACRA, which, if not amended in future legislation, will eventually replace the traditional fee-for-service payment model for physicians with a new value-based payment initiative; the CMS exempted approximately two-thirds of physician practices from MACRA compliance in 2018;


• | equalization of Medicare payment rates across different facility-type settings; Section 603 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 lowered Medicare payment rates, effective January 1, 2017 for services provided in off-campus, provider-based outpatient departments to the same level of rates for physician-office settings for those facilities not grandfathered under the current Medicare rates as of the law’s date of enactment, November 2, 2015;


• | the continued adoption by providers of federal standards for the meaningful-use of electronic health records;


• | anti-trust scrutiny of health insurance company mergers; and


• | consideration of significant cost-saving overhauls of Medicare and Medicaid, including capped federal Medicaid payments to states, premium-support models to provide for a fixed amount of Medicare benefits per enrollee, and an increase in the eligibility age for Medicare.

The Company cannot predict whether any proposals will be fully implemented, adopted, repealed, or amended, or what effect, whether positive or negative, such proposals might have on the Company's business.

Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property (such as the Company) may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, under, or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as certain other potential costs (including government fines and injuries to persons and adjacent property) relating to hazardous or toxic substances. Most, if not all, of these laws, ordinances and regulations contain stringent enforcement provisions including, but not limited to, the authority to impose substantial administrative, civil, and criminal fines and penalties upon violators. Such laws often impose liability, without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or disposal of such substances, and may be imposed on the owner in connection with the activities of a tenant or operator of the property. The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or lease such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. A property can also be negatively impacted either through physical contamination, or by virtue of an adverse effect on value, from contamination that has or may have emanated from other properties.
Operations of the properties owned, developed or managed by the Company are and will continue to be subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, including those relating to the following: the generation, segregation, handling, packaging and disposal of medical wastes; air quality requirements related to operations of generators, incineration devices, or sterilization equipment; facility siting and construction; disposal of non-medical wastes and ash from incinerators; and underground storage tanks. Certain properties owned, developed or managed by the Company contain, and others may contain or at one time may have contained, underground storage tanks that are or were used to store waste oils, petroleum products or other hazardous substances. Such underground storage tanks can be the source of releases of hazardous or toxic materials. Operations of nuclear medicine departments at some properties also involve the use and handling, and subsequent disposal of, radioactive isotopes and similar materials, activities which are closely regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and state regulatory agencies. In addition, several of the Company's properties were built during the period that asbestos was commonly used in building construction and other such facilities may be acquired by the Company in the future. The presence of such materials could result in significant costs in the event that any asbestos-containing materials requiring immediate removal and/or encapsulation are located in or on any facilities or in the event of any future renovation activities.
The Company has had environmental site assessments conducted on substantially all of the properties that it currently owns. These site assessments are limited in scope and provide only an evaluation of potential environmental conditions associated with the property, not compliance assessments of ongoing operations. While it is the Company’s policy to seek indemnification from tenants relating to environmental liabilities or conditions, even where leases do contain such provisions, there can be no assurance that the tenant will be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations. In addition, the terms of the Company’s leases or financial support agreements do not give the Company control over the operational activities of its tenants or healthcare operators, nor will the Company monitor the tenants or healthcare operators with respect to environmental matters.
Insurance
The Company carries comprehensive liability insurance and property insurance covering its owned and managed properties, including those held under long-term ground leases. In addition, tenants under long-term single-tenant net leases are required to carry property insurance covering the Company’s interest in the buildings.
Employees
At December 31, 2017, the Company employed 273 people. The employees are not members of any labor union, and the Company considers its relations with its employees to be excellent.
