Item 1.  Business
General
 
The Company is a savings and loan holding company chartered as a corporation in the state of Maryland in 1990.  It conducts business primarily through two subsidiaries, Severn Savings Bank, FSB (“Bank”) and SBI Mortgage Company (“SBI”).  The Bank’s principal subsidiary Louis Hyatt, Inc. (“Hyatt Commercial”), conducts business as Hyatt Commercial, a commercial real estate brokerage and property management company.  SBI holds mortgages that do not meet the underwriting criteria of the Bank, and is the parent company of Crownsville Development Corporation (“Crownsville”), which is doing business as Annapolis Equity Group, which acquires real estate for syndication and investment purposes.
 
The Bank has five branches in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, which offer a full range of deposit products, and originate mortgages in its primary market of Anne Arundel County, Maryland and, to a lesser extent, in other parts of Maryland, Delaware and Virginia.
 
The Bank operated under a Formal Agreement dated April 13, 2013, (the “Formal Agreement”), with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). This agreement replaced the former Supervisory Agreement dated November 23, 2009 that the Bank had with the now defunct Office of Thrift Supervision (the “OTS”). The Bank satisfied all of the conditions of the Formal Agreement and on October 15, 2015 it was notified by the OCC that the agreement was terminated.
 
The Company previously operated under a Supervisory Agreement dated November 23, 2009, (the “Supervisory Agreement”) with the now defunct OTS. Upon the abolishment of the OTS on July 21, 2011, the Federal Reserve Bank assumed the regulation of the Company. The Company satisfied all of the conditions of the Supervisory Agreement and on January 21, 2016 it was notified by the Federal Reserve Bank that the Supervisory Agreement was terminated.
 
On April 23, 2013, the Bank was notified by the OCC that the OCC established minimum capital ratios for the Bank requiring it to immediately maintain a Tier I Leverage Capital Ratio to Adjusted Total Assets of at least 10% and a Total Risk-Based Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets ratio of at least 15%.  On October 15, 2015, the Bank was notified by the OCC that these additional minimum capital ratios were no longer required.
 
As of December 31, 2016 the Bank was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.  To be categorized as well capitalized the Bank must maintain the following minimum ratios: Total Risk-Based Capital – 10.0%, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital – 6.5%, Tier 1 Capital (to risk-weighted assets) – 8%, Tier 1 Capital (to adjusted total assets) – 5.0%.
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had consolidated total assets of $787,485,000, total deposits of $571,946,000, and total stockholders’ equity of $87,930,000. The Company’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $15,540,000.  For more information, see “Item 6. Selected Financial Data.”

Business of the Bank
 
The Bank was organized in 1946 in Baltimore, Maryland as Pompeii Permanent Building and Loan Association.  It relocated to Annapolis, Maryland in 1980 and its name was changed to Severn Savings Association.  Subsequently, the Bank obtained a federal charter and changed its name to Severn Savings Bank, FSB.  The Bank operates five full-service branch offices and one administrative office.  The Bank operates as a federally chartered savings bank whose principal business is attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds in mortgage and commercial loans. The Bank also uses advances, or loans, from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, (“FHLB-Atlanta”) to fund its lending activities.  The Bank provides a wide range of personal and commercial banking services. Personal services include mortgage lending and various other lending services as well as checking, savings, money market, time deposit and individual retirement accounts. Commercial services include commercial secured and unsecured lending services as well as business internet banking, corporate cash management services and deposit services.  The Bank also provides safe deposit boxes, ATMs, debit cards, credit cards, personal internet banking including on-line bill pay, mortgage lending, and telephone banking, among other products and services.
 
The Bank’s revenues are derived principally from interest earned on mortgage, commercial and other loans, and fees charged in connection with the loans and banking services.  The Bank’s primary sources of funds are deposits, advances from the FHLB-Atlanta, proceeds from loans sold on the secondary market, and repayments and principal prepayment of its loans.  The principal executive offices of the Bank are maintained at 200 Westgate Circle, Suite 200, Annapolis Maryland, 21401. Its telephone number is 410-260-2000 and its website address is www.severnbank.com.

Earnings
 
The Bank’s earnings depend primarily on the difference between the income from interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings.  The Bank also originates and sells residential mortgages into the secondary market, generating gains on the loans sold. Rapid changes in interest rates may adversely affect the Bank’s earnings. The Bank monitors and manages this risk through its asset/liability committee.
Competition
 
The Annapolis, Maryland area has a high density of financial institutions, many of which are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than the Bank, and all of which are competitors of the Bank to varying degrees.  The Bank’s competition for loans comes primarily from savings and loan associations, savings banks, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, and commercial banks.  Many of the Bank’s competitors have higher legal lending limits than the Bank.  The Bank’s most direct competition for deposits has historically come from savings and loan associations, savings banks, commercial banks, and credit unions.  The Bank faces additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds and other corporate and government securities funds.  The Bank also faces increased competition for deposits from other financial institutions such as brokerage firms, insurance companies and mutual funds.  The Bank is a community-oriented financial institution serving its market area with a wide selection of mortgage loans and other consumer and commercial financial products and services.  Management considers the Bank’s reputation for financial strength and customer service as its major competitive advantage in attracting and retaining customers in its market area.  The Bank also believes it benefits from its community engagement activities.
Net Interest Income
 
Net interest income increases during periods when the spread between the Company’s weighted average rate at which new interest-earning assets such as loans and securities are originated or purchased and the weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities widens.  Market factors such as interest rates, competition, consumer preferences, the supply of and demand for housing, and the availability of funds affect the Bank’s ability to originate loans.
 
The Company has supplemented its interest income through purchases of investments when appropriate.  This activity is intended to generate positive interest rate spreads on large principal balances with minimal administrative expense.
 
Interest Rate and Volume of Interest-Related Assets and Liabilities
 
Both changes in rate and changes in the composition of the Company’s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities can have a significant effect on net interest income.
 
For information concerning the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest-related assets and liabilities have affected  the Company’s interest income and expense during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, refer to Item 6, “Selected Financial Data - Rate Volume Table”.

Market Area
 
The Bank’s market area is primarily Anne Arundel County, Maryland and nearby areas, and its five branch locations are all located in Anne Arundel County.
 
The Bank continues to expand its business relationship banking department by focusing on the needs of the business community in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.  In addition, the Bank increased its offerings to businesses and consumers, including additional commercial lending products, business internet banking, and an expanded line of consumer deposit products.  The Bank has traditionally focused its lending activities on first mortgage loans secured by real estate for the purpose of purchasing, refinancing, developing and constructing one-to-four family residences and commercial properties in and near Anne Arundel County, Maryland. The Bank originates residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. It generally sells the loans with the servicing rights released. However, for loans sold to Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”), the servicing rights have been retained.

The Bank originates residential mortgage loans that are to be held in the Bank’s loan portfolio as well as loans that are intended for sale in the secondary market.  Loans sold in the secondary market are primarily sold to investors with which the Bank maintains a correspondent relationship.  These loans are made in conformity with standard underwriting criteria per the investors to assure maximum eligibility for possible resale in the secondary market, and are approved either by the Bank’s underwriter or the correspondent’s underwriter.  Loans considered for the Bank’s portfolio with borrowers that have lending relationships less than $500,000 are approved by any of the Bank’s Officers, which includes the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Credit Officer and the Chief Lending Officer.  Loans considered for the Bank’s portfolio with borrowers that have lending relationships of $500,000 or greater are approved by the Bank’s Directors Loan Committee.  Meetings of the Directors Loan Committee are open to attendance by any member of the Bank’s Board of Directors who wishes to attend.  The loan committee reports to and consults with the Board of Directors in interpreting and applying the Bank’s lending policy.  Single loans greater than $2,000,000, or loans to one borrower aggregating more than $4,000,000, up to $14,846,000 (the maximum amount of loans to one borrower as of December 31, 2016), must also have Board of Directors’ approval.

Loans that are sold into the secondary market are typically residential long-term (15 or more years) with fixed, and occasionally variable, rates of interest.  Loans retained for the Company’s portfolio typically include construction loans, commercial loans and loans that periodically reprice or mature prior to the end of an amortized term.  Generally, loans are sold with servicing released, however for loans sold to FHLMC or FNMA, the servicing has been retained. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank was servicing $18,288,000 in loans for FHLMC, $39,095,000 in loans for FNMA and $17,844,000 in loans for other investors.
 
The following table contains information, as of December 31, 2016, on the percentage of fixed-rate single-family loans serviced for others by the Bank, by interest rate category.
 

Interest rate range | Percentage of Portfolio | 
--------------------+-------------------------+------
Less than 5.00% | | 92.4 | %
5.00 – 6.00% | | 7.4 | %
6.01 – 7.00% | | 0.1 | %
7.01 – 8.00% | | 0.0 | %
Over 8.00% | | 0.1 | %
 | | 100.0 | %

 
The Bank’s mortgage loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan, and the adequacy of the value of the property that will secure the loan.  The authority of the Directors Loan Committee to approve loans is established by the Board of Directors and currently is commensurate with the Bank’s limitation on loans to one borrower.  The Bank’s maximum amount of loans to one borrower currently is equal to 15% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital, or $14,846,000 as of December 31, 2016.  Loans greater than this amount require participation by one or more additional lenders.  Letters of credit are subject to the same limitations as direct loans.  The Bank utilizes independent qualified appraisers approved by the Board of Directors to appraise the properties securing its loans and requires title insurance or title opinions so as to insure that the Bank has a valid lien on the mortgaged real estate.  The Bank requires borrowers to maintain fire and casualty insurance on its secured properties.
 
The procedure for approval of construction loans is the same for residential mortgage loans, except that the appraiser evaluates the building plans, construction specifications, and estimates of construction costs.  The Bank also evaluates the feasibility of the proposed construction project and the experience and track record of the developer.  In addition, all construction loans generally require a commitment from a third-party lender or from the Bank for a permanent long-term loan to replace the construction loan upon completion of construction.
 
Residential Mortgage Loans
 
At December 31, 2016, the Company’s residential mortgage loan portfolio totaled $260,603,000, or 40.8% of the Company’s loan portfolio.  All of the Company’s residential mortgage loans are secured by one to four family residential properties and are primarily located in the Bank’s market area.
Commercial Real Estate Loans
 
At December 31, 2016, the Company’s commercial real estate loan portfolio totaled $195,710,000, or 30.6% of the Company’s loan portfolio.  All of the Company’s commercial real estate loans are secured by improved property such as office buildings, retail strip shopping centers, industrial condominium units and other small businesses, most of which are located in the Bank’s primary lending area.  The largest commercial real estate loan outstanding at December 31, 2016 was a $14,100,000 loan secured by commercial property in Middle River, Maryland.  This loan has consistently performed in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument.
 
Loans secured by commercial real estate properties generally involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans.  Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of these loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.

Construction and Land Acquisition and Development Loans
 
The Bank originates loans to finance the construction of one-to-four family dwellings, and to a lesser extent, commercial real estate.  It also originates loans for the acquisition and development of unimproved property to be used for residential and/or commercial purposes in cases where the Bank is to provide the construction funds to improve the properties.  As of December 31, 2016, the Company had 91 construction loans outstanding in the gross aggregate amount of $57,166,000, representing 8.9% of its loan portfolio.  Included in that total were commitments to advance an additional $15,728,000.
 
Construction loan amounts are based on the appraised value of the property and, for builder loans, a feasibility study as to the potential marketability and profitability of the project.  Construction loans generally have terms of up to one year, with reasonable extensions as needed, and typically have interest rates that float monthly at margins ranging from the prime rate to 2 percent above the prime rate.   In addition to builders’ projects, the Bank finances the construction of single family, owner-occupied houses where qualified contractors are involved and on the basis of strict written underwriting and construction loan guidelines.  Construction loans are structured either to be converted to permanent loans with the Bank upon the expiration of the construction phase or to be paid off by financing from another financial institution.
 
Construction loans afford the Bank the opportunity to increase the interest rate sensitivity of its loan portfolio and to receive yields higher than those obtainable on loans secured by existing residential properties.  These higher yields correspond to the higher risks associated with construction lending.   Construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction that is of uncertain value prior to its completion.  Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to value accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio.  As a result, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the ultimate success of the project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest.  If the Bank is forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion, due to a default, there can be no assurance that the Bank will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs.  In addition, the Bank may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time.  The Bank has attempted to address these risks through its underwriting procedures and its limited amount of construction lending on multi-family and commercial real estate properties.
 
It is the policy of the Bank to conduct physical inspections of each property secured by a construction or rehabilitation loan for the purpose of reporting upon the progress of the construction of improvements.  These inspections, referred to as “construction draw inspections,” are to be performed at the time of a request for an advance of construction funds.  If no construction advance has been requested, a construction inspector or senior officer of the institution makes an inspection of the subject property at least quarterly.
 
Land and Residential Building Lots
 
Land loans include loans to developers for the development of residential subdivisions and loans on unimproved lots primarily to individuals.  At December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding land and residential building lot loans totaling $48,664,000, or 7.6% of the total loan portfolio.  The largest of these loans is for $4,745,000, is secured by residential lots in Severn, Maryland, and has performed in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument.  Land development loans typically are short-term loans; the duration of these loans is typically not greater than three years.  The interest rate on land loans is generally at least 1% or 2% over the prime rate.   The loan-to-value ratio generally does not exceed 75% at the time of loan origination. Land and residential building lot loans typically are made to customers of the Bank and developers and contractors with whom the Bank has had previous lending experience.  In addition to the customary requirements for these types of loans, the Bank may also require a satisfactory Phase I environmental study and feasibility study to determine the profit potential of the development.

Lines of Credit and Commercial Non-Real Estate Loans
 
The Bank also offers other business and commercial loans.  These are loans to businesses are typically lines of credit or other loans that are not secured by real estate, although equipment, securities, or other collateral may secure them.  They typically are offered to customers with long-standing relationships with the Bank.  At December 31, 2016, $46,468,000, or 7.3%, of the loan portfolio consisted of lines of credit and other commercial loans.
Home Equity and Other Consumer Loans
 
The Bank also offers other loans to consumers, including home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans.  At December 31, 2016, $20,339,000, or 3.2% of the loan portfolio consisted of these loans.
Loan Portfolio Cash Flows
 
The following table sets forth the estimated maturity of the Company’s loan portfolios by type of loan at December 31, 2016.  The estimated maturity reflects contractual terms at December 31, 2016.  Contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual life of the Bank’s loan portfolios.  The average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of loan prepayments and because of enforcement of “due on sale” clauses.  The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase, however, when current mortgage loan rates substantially exceed rates on existing mortgage loans.

Loans to One Borrower
 
Under regulatory guidelines, the aggregate amount of loans that the Bank may make to one borrower was $14,846,000 at December 31, 2016, which is 15% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.  The Bank’s three largest loans at December 31, 2016 were a $14,100,000 loan secured by commercial property located in Middle River, Maryland, an $8,500,000 loan secured by commercial property in Landover, Maryland and a $7,431,000 loan secured by commercial property located in Edgewater, Maryland.  At December 31, 2016, all three loans were performing as agreed.
 
Origination and Sale of Loans
 
The Bank originates residential loans in conformity with standard underwriting criteria per its loan investors to assure maximum eligibility for possible resale in the secondary market.  Although the Bank has authority to lend anywhere in the United States, it has confined its loan origination activities primarily to the states of Maryland, Virginia and Delaware.
 
Loan originations are developed from a number of sources, primarily from referrals from real estate brokers, internet leads, builders, and existing and walk‑in customers.
 
The Bank’s mortgage loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower's ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan, and the adequacy of the value of the property that will secure the loan.  Loans considered for the Bank’s portfolio with borrowers that have lending relationships less than $500,000 are approved by any of the Bank’s Officers, which includes the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Credit Officer and the Chief Lending Officer.  Loans considered for the Bank’s portfolio with borrowers that have lending relationships of $500,000 or greater are approved by the Bank’s Directors Loan Committee.  Meetings of the Directors’ Loan Committee are open to attendance by any member of the Bank’s Board of Directors who wishes to attend.  The loan committee reports to and consults with the Board of Directors in interpreting and applying the Bank’s lending policy.  Single loans greater than $2,000,000, or loans to one borrower aggregating more than $4,000,000, up to $14,846,000 (the maximum amount of loans to one borrower as of December 31, 2016), must also have Board of Directors’ approval. The Bank utilizes independent qualified appraisers approved by the Board of Directors to appraise the properties securing its loans and requires title insurance or title opinions so as to insure that the Bank has a valid lien on the mortgaged real estate. The Bank requires borrowers to maintain fire and casualty insurance on its secured properties.

The procedure for approval of construction loans is the same as for residential mortgage loans, except that the appraiser evaluates the building plans, construction specifications, and estimates of construction costs.  The Bank also evaluates the feasibility of the proposed construction project and the experience and track record of the developer.  In addition, all construction loans generally require a commitment from a third-party lender or from the Bank for a permanent long-term loan to replace the construction loan upon completion of construction.
 
Consumer loans are underwritten on the basis of the borrower's credit history and an analysis of the borrower's income and expenses, ability to repay the loan, and the value of the collateral, if any.
 
Currently, it is the Bank’s policy to originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans. The Bank is currently active in the secondary market and sells a portion of its fixed-rate, and occasionally adjustable-rate, loans.
 
Interest Rates, Points and Fees
 
The Bank realizes interest, point, and fee income from its lending activities.  The Bank also realizes income from commitment fees for making commitments to originate loans, and from prepayment and late charges, loan fees, application fees, and fees for other miscellaneous services.
 
The Bank accounts for loan origination fees in accordance with standards set on the accounting for deferred costs and fees. These standards prohibit the immediate recognition of loan origination fees as revenues and require that such income (net of certain direct loan origination costs) for each loan be amortized, generally by the interest method, over the estimated life of the loan as an adjustment of yield.  The Bank also realizes income from gains on sales of loans, and servicing released fees for loans sold with servicing released.
 
Delinquencies, Allowance for Loan Losses and Classified Assets
 
Delinquencies
 
Management reviews delinquencies on all loans monthly.  The Company’s collection procedures include sending a past due notice to the borrower on the 17th day of nonpayment, making telephone contact with the borrower between 20 and 30 days after nonpayment, and sending a letter after the 30th day of nonpayment. A notice of intent to foreclose is generally sent between 60 and 90 days after delinquency.  When the borrower is contacted, the Company attempts to obtain full payment of the past due amount.  However, the Company generally will seek to reach agreement with the borrower on a payment plan to avoid foreclosure.
Allowance for Loan Losses
 
An allowance for loan losses is provided through charges to income in an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible, based on evaluations of the collectability of loans and prior loan loss experience.  The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions that may affect the borrowers' ability to pay.  Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of estimates and assumptions, which is permitted under generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.  While management uses available information to estimate losses on loans, future additions to the allowances may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, particularly in the State of Maryland.  In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank's allowance for losses on loans.  Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
 
The allowance consists of specific and general components.  The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired.  When a real estate secured loan becomes impaired, a decision is made as to whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary.  This decision is based on various considerations, including the age of the most recent appraisal, the loan-to-value ratio based on the original appraisal and the condition of the property.  Appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value.  The discounts also include estimated costs to sell the property.
 
 12
 

For loans secured by non-real estate collateral, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, estimated fair values are determined based on the borrower’s financial statements, inventory reports, accounts receivable aging or equipment appraisals or invoices.  Indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information and the quality of the assets.
 
For such loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the current market value of the underlying collateral less its estimated disposal costs has not been finalized, but management determines that it is likely that the value is lower than the carrying value of that loan.  Once the net collateral value has been determined, a charge-off is taken for the difference between the net collateral value and the carrying value of the loan. For loans that are not solely collateral dependent, an allowance is established when the present value of the expected future cash flows of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan.  The general component relates to loans that are classified as doubtful, substandard or special mention that are not considered impaired, as well as non-classified loans.  The general reserve is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors.  These qualitative factors include:
 
 
· | Levels and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | Inherent risk in the loan portfolio;
--+-------------------------------------


· | Trends in volume and terms of loans;
--+-------------------------------------


· | Effects of any change in lending policies and procedures;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | Experience, ability and depth of management;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | National and local economic trends and conditions; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | Effect of any changes in concentration of credit.
--+--------------------------------------------------



A loan is generally considered impaired if it meets either of the following two criteria:
 
 
· | Loans that are 90 days or more in arrears (nonaccrual loans); or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | Loans where, based on current information and events, it is probable that a borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Credit quality risk ratings include regulatory classifications of special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss.  Loans classified as special mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention.  If uncorrected, the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects.  Loans classified substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.  They include loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current conditions and facts, is highly improbable.  Loans classified as a loss are considered uncollectible and are charged to the allowance for loan losses.  Loans not classified are rated pass.
 
A loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring, sometimes referred to as a TDR, when the Bank, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider.  Loan modifications made with terms consistent with current market conditions that the borrower could obtain in the open market are not considered a TDR.
 
Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired.  Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.

The Bank discontinues the accrual of interest on loans 90 days or more past due, at which time all previously accrued but uncollected interest is deducted from income.  $506,000 in interest income would have been recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the year ended December 31, 2016 or since their origination (if held for only part of the fiscal year).  For the year ended December 31, 2016, $427,000 in interest income on such loans was actually included in net income.  The following table sets forth information as to non-accrual loans and other non-performing assets.

Classified Assets
 
Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities, considered by the OCC to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss assets.” An asset is considered substandard if the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any, inadequately protects it.  Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values.  Assets classified as loss assets are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.  Assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification in one of these categories but possess credit deficiencies or potential weakness are required to be designated special mention by management.
 
When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it is required to establish general allowances for losses in an amount deemed prudent by management.  General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets.  When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss assets, it is to charge-off such amount.  An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets is subject to scrutiny by the OCC, which can require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.  The Bank reviews monthly the assets in its portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations.
 
Total classified loans decreased $2,247,000 to $11,626,000 at December 31, 2016 from $13,873,000 at December 31, 2015 primarily due to an improving economy.  All of these loans were classified as substandard.   The allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2016 was $8,969,000, which was 1.4% of gross loans receivable and 91.0% of total non-performing loans.

Investment Activities
 
The Bank may invest in various types of liquid assets, including United States Treasury obliga-tions and securities of various federal agencies, including mortgage-backed securities, certificates of deposit at insured banks, bankers' acceptances and federal funds.  As a member of the FHLB System, the Bank must maintain minimum levels of liquid assets specified by the OCC, which vary from time to time.  Subject to various regulatory restrictions, banks may also invest a portion of their assets in certain commercial paper, corporate debt securities and mutual funds whose assets conform to the investments that a bank is authorized to make directly.
 
The amortized cost of the Bank’s investment securities which are all held to maturity as of the dates indicated, are presented in the following table (excluding FHLB Stock) :

Deposits
 
Deposits are attracted principally from within the Bank’s primary market areas through the offering of a variety of deposit instruments, including passbook and statement accounts and certificates of deposit ranging in terms from three months to five years.  Deposit account terms vary, principally on the basis of the minimum balance required; the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate.  The Bank also offers individual retirement accounts.
 
The Bank’s policies are designed primarily to attract deposits from local residents rather than to solicit deposits from areas outside the Bank’s primary markets. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank had $6,364,000 in brokered deposits. Interest rates paid maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established by the Bank on a periodic basis.  Determination of rates and terms are predicated upon funds acquisition and liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors, growth goals and federal regulations.
 
Deposits in the Bank as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 consisted of the accounts described below:

Liquidity and Asset/Liability Management
 
Two major objectives of asset and liability management are to maintain adequate liquidity and to control the interest sensitivity of the balance sheet.
 
Liquidity is the measure of a company’s ability to maintain sufficient cash flow to fund operations and to meet financial obligations to depositors and borrowers.  Liquidity is provided by the ability to attract and retain deposits and by principal and interest payments on loans and maturing securities in the investment portfolio.  A strong core deposit base, supplemented by other deposits of varying maturities and rates, contributes to the Bank’s liquidity.
 
Management believes that funds available through short-term borrowings and asset maturities are adequate to meet all anticipated needs for the next twelve months, and management is continually monitoring the Bank’s liquidity position to meet projected needs.
 
Interest rate sensitivity is maintaining the ability to reprice interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in relationship to changes in the general level of interest rates.  Management attributes interest rate sensitivity to a steady net interest margin through all phases of interest rate cycles.  Management attempts to make the necessary adjustments to constrain adverse swings in net interest income resulting from interest rate movements through gap analysis and income simulation modeling techniques.
 
Borrowings
 
FHLB of Atlanta
 
The Bank’s credit availability under the FHLB of Atlanta’s credit availability program was $232,193,000 at December 31, 2016.  The Bank’s credit availability is based on the level of collateral pledged up to 30% of total assets. The Bank, from time to time, utilizes the line of credit when interest rates under the line are more favorable than obtaining deposits from the public.
Subordinated Debentures
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding approximately $20,619,000 in principal amount of Junior Subordinated Debt Securities Due 2035 (the “2035 Debentures”).  The 2035 Debentures were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of December 17, 2004 (the “2035 Indenture”) between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as Trustee.  The 2035 Debentures pay interest quarterly at a floating rate of interest of 3-month LIBOR (0.88% at December 31, 2016) plus 200 basis points, and mature on January 7, 2035.  Payments of principal, interest, premium and other amounts under the 2035 Debentures are subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the Company, as defined in the 2035 Indenture.  The 2035 Debentures became redeemable, in whole or in part, by the Company on January 7, 2010.
 
The 2035 Debentures were issued and sold to Severn Capital Trust I (the “Trust”), of which 100% of the common equity is owned by the Company.  The Trust was formed for the purpose of issuing corporation-obligated mandatorily redeemable Capital Securities (“Capital Securities”) to third-party investors and using the proceeds from the sale of such Capital Securities to purchase the 2035 Debentures.  The 2035 Debentures held by the Trust are the sole assets of the Trust.  Distributions on the Capital Securities issued by the Trust are payable quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate being earned by the Trust on the 2035 Debentures.  The Capital Securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the 2035 Debentures.   The Company has entered into an agreement which, taken collectively, fully and unconditionally guarantees the Capital Securities subject to the terms of the guarantee.
 
Under the terms of the 2035 Debenture, the Company is permitted to defer the payment of interest on the 2035 Debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods, provided that no event of default has occurred and is continuing.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company had deferred the payment of fifteen quarters of interest and the cumulative amount of interest in arrears not paid, including interest on unpaid interest, was $1,863,000.  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company paid all of the deferred interest and as of December 31, 2016, the Company is current on all interest due on the 2035 Debenture.

Subordinated Notes and Series A Preferred Stock
 
On November 15, 2008, the Company completed a private placement offering consisting of a total of 70 units, at an offering price of $100,000 per unit, for gross proceeds of $7,000,000. Each unit consists of 6,250 shares of the Company's Series A 8.0% Non-Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and the Company's Subordinated Notes (“Subordinated Notes”) in the original principal amount of $50,000. The Subordinated Notes earned interest at an annual rate of 8.0%, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December commencing December 31, 2008.  The Subordinated Notes were redeemable in whole or in part at the option of the Company at any time beginning on December 31, 2009 until maturity, which was December 31, 2018.  Dividends will not be paid on the Company’s common stock in any quarter until the dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock has been paid for such quarter; however, there is no requirement that the Company’s board of directors declare any dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and any unpaid dividends are not cumulative.
 
Dividends on the Series A preferred stock have been declared and paid on June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016 and December 30, 2016 in the amount of $70,000 each quarter. Prior to that, the Company had not paid a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock since the first quarter of 2012.
 
On September 30, 2016 the aggregate principal amount of Subordinated Notes outstanding of $3,500,000 was paid in full.  The Subordinated Notes were redeemable in whole or in part at the option of the Company at any time beginning on December 31, 2009 until maturity, which was December 31, 2018.  Debt issuance costs totaled $245,000 and were taken back into income upon the redemption.
 
Notes Payable
 
On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a loan agreement with a commercial bank whereby the Company borrowed $3,500,000 for a term of 8 years. The unsecured note bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.25% for the first 36 months then, at the option of the Company, converts to either (1) floating rate of the Wall Street Journal Prime plus 0.50% or (2) fixed rate at two hundred seventy five (275) basis points over the five year amortizing Federal Home Loan Bank rate for the remaining five years. Repayment terms are monthly interest only payments for the first 36 months, then quarterly principal payments of $175,000 plus interest. The loan is subject to a prepayment penalty of 1% of the principal amount prepaid during the first 36 months. If the Company elects the 5 year fixed rate of 275 basis points over the Federal Home Loan Bank rate (“FHLB Rate Period”), the loan will be subject to a prepayment penalty of 2% during the first and second years of the FHLB Rate Period and 1% of the principal repaid during the third, fourth and fifth years of the FHLB Rate Period. The Company may make additional principal payments from internally generated funds of up to $875,000 per year during any fixed rate period without penalty. There is no prepayment penalty during any floating rate period.

Federal Banking Regulation
 
The financial services industry in the Bank’s market area is highly competitive, including competition from commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, finance companies and non-bank providers of financial services. Several of the Bank’s competitors have legal lending limits that exceed that of the Bank’s, as well as funding sources in the capital markets that exceeds the Bank’s availability. The increased competition has resulted from a changing legal and regulatory climate, as well as from the economic climate.


 23
 

 General.  Banks and their holding companies are extensively regulated under both federal and state law.  This regulation is intended primarily to protect depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), and not the stockholders of the Company.  The summary below describes briefly the regulation that is applicable to the Company and the Bank, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations.
Federal Banking Regulation the Company
 
General. Severn Bancorp is a unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. As such, Severn Bancorp is registered with the FRB and is subject to regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the FRB has enforcement authority over Severn Bancorp and any non-savings bank subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution.
 
Permissible Activities. As a unitary savings and loan holding company, Severn Bancorp generally is not subject to activity restrictions, provided the Bank satisfies the Qualified Thrift Lender (“QTL”) test (see “Qualified Thrift Lender Test” below).  If the Bank failed to meet the QTL test, then Severn Bancorp would become subject to the activities restrictions applicable to multiple savings and loan holding companies and, unless the Bank qualified as a QTL within one year thereafter, Severn Bancorp would be required to register as, and would become subject to the restrictions applicable to, a bank holding company. Additionally, if Severn Bancorp acquired control of another savings association, other than in a supervisory acquisition where the acquired association also met the QTL test, Severn Bancorp would thereupon become a multiple savings and loan holding company and thereafter be subject to further restrictions on its activities.   The Company presently intends to continue to operate as a unitary savings and loan holding company.
 
Regulatory Capital Requirements. Under capital regulations adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, savings and loan holding companies became subject to the additional regulatory capital requirements.  However, in May 2015, amendments to the FRB’s small bank holding company policy statement (the “SBHC Policy”) became effective. The amendments made the SBHC Policy applicable to savings and loan holding companies, such as Severn Bancorp, and increased the asset threshold to qualify to be subject to the provisions of the SBHC Policy from $500 million to $1.0 billion. Savings and loan holding companies that have total assets of $1.0 billion or less are subject to the SBHC Policy and are not required to comply with the regulatory capital requirements described below provided that such holding company (i) is not engaged in significant nonbanking activities either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; (ii) does not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities (including securitization and asset management or administration) either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; and (iii) does not have a material amount of debt or equity securities outstanding (other than trust preferred securities) that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The FRB may in its discretion exclude any savings and loan holding company, regardless of asset size, from the SBHB Policy if such action is warranted for supervisory purposes.   The exemption continues until the Company’s total assets exceed $1.0 billion, does not meet the other requirements discussed above or the FRB deems it to be warranted for supervisory purposes.
 
Certain of the savings and loan holding company capital requirements promulgated by the FRB in 2013 became effective as of January 1, 2015. Those requirements establish the following four minimum capital ratios that savings and loan holding companies not subject to the SBHC Policy must comply with as of that date: (i) a common equity tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.0% (up from 4%); (iii) a total capital to total risk-weighted assets ratio of 8%; and (iv) a tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio of 4%.  For more information, see “Regulatory Capital Requirements” under “Regulation of the Bank” below.
 
 24
 

Restrictions on Acquisitions. Except under limited circumstances, savings and loan holding companies, such as  the Company, are prohibited from (i) acquiring, without approval of the FRB, control of a savings association or a savings and loan holding company or all or substantially all of the assets of any such association or holding company (ii) acquiring, without prior approval of the FRB, more than 5% of the voting shares of a savings association or a holding company which is not a subsidiary thereof or (iii) acquiring control of an uninsured institution, or retaining, for more than one year after the date of any savings association becomes uninsured, control of such association.  In evaluating proposed acquisitions of savings institutions by holding companies, the FRB considers the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the holding company and the target institution, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the DIF, the convenience and the needs of the community and competitive factors.
No director or officer of a savings and loan holding company or person owning or controlling by proxy or otherwise more than 25% of such company’s stock, may acquire control of any savings association, other than a subsidiary savings association, or of any other savings and loan holding company, without written approval of the FRB. Certain individuals, including Alan J. Hyatt, Louis Hyatt, and Melvin Hyatt, and their respective spouses (“Applicants”), filed an Application for Notice of Change In Control (“Notice”) in April 2001 pursuant to 12 CFR Section 574.3(b).  The Notice permitted the Applicants to acquire up to 32.32% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of stock of the Company by April 16, 2002.  Its then regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision, approved requests by the Applicants to extend the time to consummate such acquisition of shares to December 16, 2011. The Applicants currently own approximately 29.86% of the total outstanding shares of the Company as of December 31, 2016.
 
The FRB is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and (ii) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions.  The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
 
Federal Securities Law. The Company’s securities are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  As such, the Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading, and other requirements and restrictions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Financial Services Modernization Legislation. In November 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”) was enacted. The GLBA generally permits banks, other depository institutions, insurance companies and securities firms to enter into combinations that result in a single financial services organization to offer customers a wider array of financial services and products provided that they do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally.
 
The GLBA resulted in increased competition for the Company and the Bank from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products, many of which may have substantially more financial resources than  the Company and the Bank.
 
Maryland Corporation Law. The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland, and is therefore subject to regulation by the state of Maryland.  The rights of the Company’s stockholders are governed by the Maryland General Corporation Law.
 
Regulation of the Bank
 
General. As a federally chartered, DIF-insured savings association, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation, primarily by the OCC and secondarily the FDIC.  Lending activities and other investments of the Bank must comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements.  The Bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the FRB.  The OCC regularly examines the Bank and prepares reports for the consideration of the Bank’s Board of Directors on the operations of the Bank.  The relationship between the Bank and depositors and borrowers is also regulated by federal and state laws, especially in such matters as the ownership of savings accounts and the form and content of mortgage documents utilized by the Bank.
 
 25
 

The Bank must file reports with the OCC and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions.
 
Regulatory Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require all FDIC-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity tier 1 capital to total risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%; a tier 1 capital to total risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to total risk-based assets ratio of 8%, a tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio of 4%, and a tangible capital, measured as core capital (tier 1 capital), to average total assets ratio of 1.5%.
 
Common equity tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock and related surplus, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and, subject to certain adjustments, minority common equity interests in subsidiaries, reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets (other than certain mortgage servicing assets), net of associated deferred tax liabilities.
 
Tier 1 Capital means the sum of common equity tier 1 capital and additional tier 1 capital. Additional tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Under the amendments, cumulative preferred stock (other than cumulative preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury Department under the TARP Capital Purchase Program or the Small Business Lending Fund) no longer qualifies as additional tier 1 capital.  Trust preferred securities and other non-qualifying capital instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank and savings and loan holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009 or by mutual holding companies may continue to be included in tier 1 capital but will be phased out over 10 years beginning in 2016 for all other banking organizations.
 
Total Capital includes tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock, and subordinated debt.
 
Tangible Capital means the amount of core capital (tier 1 capital), plus the amount of outstanding perpetual preferred stock (including related surplus) not included in tier 1 capital.
 
Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
 
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, and residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to first lien residential mortgages not qualifying under the prudently underwritten standards as well as commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans, a risk weight of 250% is assigned to certain mortgage serving rights, and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
 
In addition to higher capital requirements, the amended regulations provide that depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain a common equity tier 1 Capital conservation buffer of at least 2.5% of risk-weighted assets over and above the minimum risk-based capital requirements.  Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases or for the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management.  The capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. For 2017, the capital conservation buffer will be 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. The capital conservation buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required risk-based capital ratios to 7% common equity tier 1 capital, 8.5% tier 1 capital and 10.5% total capital on a fully phased-in basis.


 26
 

 In addition to requiring institutions to meet the applicable capital standards for savings institutions, the OCC may require institutions to meet capital standards in excess of the prescribed standards as the OCC determines necessary or appropriate for such institution in light of the particular circumstances of the institution. Such circumstances would include a high degree of exposure to interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and certain risks arising from non-traditional activity. The OCC may treat the failure of any savings institution to maintain capital at or above such level as an unsafe or unsound practice and may issue a directive requiring any savings institution which fails to maintain capital at or above the minimum level required by the OCC to submit and adhere to a plan for increasing capital.
 
As shown below, the Bank’s regulatory capital exceeded all minimum regulatory capital requirements applicable to it as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Enforcement. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has the authority to bring enforcement action against the institution and all “institution-affiliated parties,” including stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution.  Formal enforcement actions by the OCC may range from issuance of a capital directive or a cease and desist order, to removal of officers or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator.  The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the director of the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution.  If action is not taken by the director of the OCC, the FDIC has authority to take action under specific circumstances.
Safety and Soundness Standards.  Federal law requires each federal banking agency, including the OCC, to prescribe to certain standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits.  In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines.  The guidelines further provide that savings institutions should maintain safeguards to prevent the payment of compensation, fees and benefits that are excessive or that could lead to material financial loss, and should take into account factors such as comparable compensation practices at comparable institutions.  If the OCC determines that a savings institution is not in compliance with the safety and soundness guidelines, it may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the guidelines.  A savings institution must submit an acceptable compliance plan to the OCC within 30 days of receipt of a request for such a plan. If the institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, the OCC must issue an order directing the institution to correct the deficiency.  Failure to submit or implement a compliance plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions.
 
 27
 

Prompt Corrective Action.  Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the OCC is required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings associations.   For this purpose, a savings association is placed into one of the following five categories dependent on their respective capital ratios:

· | An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Generally, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the OCC to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution within 90 days of that institution becoming “critically undercapitalized”.  The regulation also provides that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days after an institution receives notice that it is “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized”.  In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to the institution, including, but not limited to, restrictions on growth, investment activities, payment of dividends and other capital distributions, and affiliate transactions.  The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against the undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and, in the case of an institution that fails to file a required capital restoration plan, the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Bank met the capital requirements of a “well capitalized” institution under applicable OCC regulations.
 
Premiums for Deposit Insurance. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC and are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. The FDIC regulations assess insurance premiums based on an institution’s risk.  Under this assessment system, the FDIC evaluates the risk of each financial institution based on its supervisory rating, financial ratios, and long-term debt issuer rating. The assessments are based on an institution’s total assets less tangible capital.  The base assessment rates range from 2.5 to 9 basis points for the least risky institutions to 30 to 45 basis points for the riskiest.  The rate schedules will automatically adjust in the future as the DIF reaches certain milestones.
 
Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated the risk categories.  Assessments for most institutions are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years.  In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio achieving 1.5%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for most banks and savings associations to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points.
 
The maximum deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor.

The FDIC is authorized to terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency.  The termination of deposit insurance for the Bank could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s earnings.
 
All FDIC-insured depository institutions pay an annual assessment to provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the Federal Housing Finance Board.  The bonds, commonly referred to as Financing Corporation (“FICO”) bonds, were issued to capitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.  The FICO assessment is based on total assets less tangible capital. The payment made in the fourth quarter of 2016 was based on a FICO assessment rate of 0.58 of a basis point and the first quarter of 2017 FICO assessment rate payment was 0.56 of a basis point.  FICO assessments will continue until the bonds mature in 2017 through 2019.
 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments.  A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operation of the Bank.
 
Privacy. The Bank is subject to the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records.  Additionally, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties.  Pursuant to the GLBA and rules adopted thereunder, financial institutions must provide:

· | initial and annual notices to customers about their privacy policies, describing the conditions under which they may disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a reasonable method for customers to “opt out” of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Since the GLBA’s enactment, a number of states have implemented their own versions of privacy laws.  The Bank has implemented its privacy policies in accordance with applicable law.
 
Loans-to-One Borrower Limitations. With certain limited exceptions, the maximum amount that a savings association or a national bank may lend to any borrower (including certain related entities of the borrower) may not exceed 15% of the unimpaired capital and surplus of the institution, plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus for loans fully secured by readily marketable collateral.
 
At December 31, 2016, the Bank’s loans-to-one-borrower limit was $14,846,000 based upon the 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus measurement.
 
Qualified Thrift Lender Test. Savings associations must meet a QTL test, which may be met either by maintaining, on average, at least 65% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments in at least nine of the most recent twelve month period, or meeting the definition of a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Code.  “Portfolio Assets” generally means total assets of a savings institution, less the sum of (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, (ii) goodwill and other intangible assets, and (iii) the value of property used in the conduct of the savings association’s business.  Qualified thrift investments are primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage‑related securities.  Associations that fail to meet the QTL test must either convert to a bank charter or operate under specified restrictions. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank was in compliance with its QTL requirement and met the definition of a domestic building and loan association.
 
 29
 

Affiliate Transactions. Transactions between savings associations and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as made applicable to savings associations by Section 11 of the Home Owners’ Loan Act (HOLA).  A savings association affiliate includes any company or entity which controls the savings institution or that is controlled by a company that controls the savings association.  For example, the holding company of a savings association and any companies which are controlled by such holding company, are affiliates of the savings association.  Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the savings association or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such association’s capital stock and surplus, as well as contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus.  Section 23B applies to “covered transactions,” as well as certain other transactions and requires that all transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the savings association as those provided to a non-affiliate.  “Covered transaction” include the making of loans to, purchase of assets from and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate and similar transactions.  Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a savings association to an affiliate.  In addition to the restrictions imposed by Sections 23A and 23B, Section 11 of the Home Owners’ Loan Act prohibits a savings association from (i) making a loan or other extension of credit to an affiliate, except for any affiliate which engages only in certain activities which are permissible for bank holding companies, or (ii) purchasing or investing in any stocks, bonds, debentures, notes or similar obligations of any affiliate, except for affiliates which are subsidiaries of the savings association.
 
The Bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors, trustees and 10% stockholders, as well as entities under such person’s control, is currently governed by Section 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated by the FRB.  Among other things, these regulations generally require such loans to be made on terms substantially similar to those offered to unaffiliated individuals, place limits on the amounts of the loans the Bank may make to such persons based, in part, on the Bank’s capital position, and require certain board of directors’ approval procedures to be followed.
 
Capital Distribution Limitations. OCC regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by savings associations, such as cash dividends, payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares, payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash-out merger and other distributions charged against capital.
 
The OCC regulations require a savings association to file an application for approval of a capital distribution if:
 
 
· | the association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings with the OCC;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the total amount of all of capital distributions, including the proposed capital distribution, for the applicable calendar year exceeds its net income for that year to date plus retained net income for the preceding two years;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the association would not be at least adequately capitalized, as determined under the capital requirements described above under “Prompt Corrective Action,” following the distribution; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the proposed capital distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, or regulatory agreement or condition.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In addition, a savings association must give the OCC notice of a capital distribution if the savings association is not required to file an application, but:
 
 
· | would not be well capitalized, as determined under the capital requirements described above under “Prompt Corrective Action,” following the distribution;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the proposed capital distribution would reduce the amount of or retire any part of the savings association's common or preferred stock or retire any part of debt instruments such as notes or debentures included in capital, other than regular payments required under a debt instrument; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the savings association is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, is filing a notice of the distribution with the FRB and is not otherwise required to file an application or notice regarding the proposed distribution with the OCC, in which case an information copy of the notice filed by the holding company with the FRB needs to be simultaneously provided to the OCC.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Further, any savings association subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as the Bank, also must file a notice with the FRB of any proposed dividend or distribution.
 
The application or notice, as applicable, must be filed with the regulators at least 30 days before the proposed declaration of dividend or approval of the proposed capital distribution by its board of directors.
 
 30
 

The OCC or FRB may prohibit a proposed dividend or capital distribution that would otherwise be permitted if it determines that:
 
 
· | following the distribution, the savings association will be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, as determined under the capital requirements described above under “Prompt Corrective Action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the proposed distribution raises safety or soundness concerns; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the proposed capital distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation or regulatory agreement or condition.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In addition, as noted above, beginning in 2016, if the Bank does not have the required capital conservation buffer under the amended capital rules, its ability to pay dividends to the Company will be limited.
 
Branching.  Under OCC branching regulations, the Bank is generally authorized to open branches in any state of the United States (i) if the Bank qualifies as a “domestic building and loan association” under the Code, which qualification requirements are similar to those for a Qualified Thrift Lender under the Home Owners’ Loan Act, or (ii) if the law of the state in which the branch is located, or is to be located, would permit establishment of the branch if the savings association were a state savings association chartered by such state.  The OCC authority preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings banks.
 
Community Reinvestment Act and the Fair Lending Laws. Federal savings banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations of the OCC to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. An institution's failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the denial of applications. In addition, an institution's failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in the OCC, other federal regulatory agencies as well as the Department of Justice taking enforcement actions.  Based on an examination conducted June 30, 2015, the Bank received a satisfactory rating.
 
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB-Atlanta. Among other benefits, each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. Each FHLB is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. Each FHLB makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the individual FHLB.
 
Under the capital plan of the FHLB-Atlanta as of December 31, 2016, the Bank was required to own at least $4,933,000 of the capital stock of the FHLB-Atlanta.  As of such date, the Bank owned $4,933,000 of the capital stock of the FHLB-Atlanta and was in compliance with the capital plan requirements.
 
Federal Reserve System. The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain non‑interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts (primarily checking, NOW, and Super NOW checking accounts) and non‑personal time deposits.  For transaction accounts in 2017, the first $15.5 million, up from $15.2 million in 2016, will be exempt from reserve requirements.  A 3 percent reserve ratio will be assessed on transaction accounts over $15.5 million up to and including $115.1 million, up from $110.2 million in 2016.  A 10 percent reserve ratio will be assessed on transaction accounts in excess of $115.1 million.  At December 31, 2016, the Bank was in compliance with the reserve requirements.
Activities of Subsidiaries. A federal savings bank seeking to establish a new subsidiary, acquire control of an existing company or conduct a new activity through an existing subsidiary must provide 30 days prior notice to the OCC and conduct any activities of the subsidiary in compliance with regulations and orders of the OCC. The OCC has the power to require a savings association to divest any subsidiary or terminate any activity conducted by a subsidiary that the OCC determines to pose a serious threat to the financial safety, soundness or stability of the savings association or to be otherwise inconsistent with sound banking practices.

Tying Arrangements. Federal savings banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other services, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
Other Regulations. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

· | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for one-to four family residential real estate receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement services;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Truth in Savings Act; and
--+--------------------------


· | rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issues regulations and standards under these federal consumer protection laws that affect our consumer businesses. These include regulations setting “ability to repay” and “qualified mortgage” standards for residential mortgage loans and mortgage loan servicing and originator compensation standards. The Bank is evaluating recent regulations and proposals, and devotes significant compliance, legal and operational resources to compliance with consumer protection regulations and standards.
 
The operations of the Bank also are subject to the:
 
 
· | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The USA PATRIOT Act, which requires savings associations to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, and due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements that also apply to financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations.
