Item 1. Business
 Truett-Hurst Inc. is a holding company incorporated in 2012 as a Delaware corporation and our sole asset is a controlling equity interest in H.D.D. LLC (the “LLC”). Unless the context suggests otherwise, references in this report to “Truett-Hurst,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Truett-Hurst, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiary. Truett-Hurst consolidates the financial results of the LLC and records a noncontrolling interest for the economic interest in the LLC it does not own. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes two classes of common stock, Class A common stock and Class B common stock.
 Quantities or results referred to as “to date” or “as of this date” mean as of or to June 30, 2018, unless otherwise specifically noted. References to “FY” or “fiscal year” refer to the fiscal year ending on June 30th of the designated year. For example, “FY18” and “fiscal year 2018” each refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. This Annual Report on Form 10-K references certain trademarks and registered trademarks which may be trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective owners.
 On October 8, 2017 and for several days thereafter, significant wildfires broke out in Napa, Sonoma, and surrounding counties in Northern California. Certain of our inventory, primarily juice pressed from grapes picked during the 2017 harvest and maintained at outside production and storage facilities, was damaged due to smoke taint during the barrel aging process. We filed a claim with our insurance carrier, who performed testing on samples sent to its labs in June 2018. The results indicated positive for exposure, and as a result we received $1.9 million in insurance proceeds in June of 2018.
 On August 13, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Precept Brands LLC, a Washington limited liability company (“Precept”) pursuant to which we have sold certain assets comprising our wholesale wine business (the “Wholesale Business”) to Precept (the “Precept Transaction”). See Note 3 “Discontinued Operations”, and Note 12 “Subsequent Events”.
 General
 Following the sale of the Wholesale Business to Precept on August 13, 2018, we are now only operating our Direct to Consumer (“DTC”) business based at our estate property in Healdsburg, California as well as the sale of our three brands to certain national retailers. We produce super ultra-premium and luxury tier Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, and Syrah for our three brands Truett Hurst, VML and Svengali. We maintain a wine club for Truett Hurst and VML and we provide a premier experience leveraging our creekside property, our hospitality, customer service and award winning wine quality. We continue to be headquartered in Sonoma County, California and lease space for wine production within a custom crush facility located in Santa Rosa, California. The DTC channel consists of sales of products produced by us through our tasting rooms, wine clubs and our winery websites.
Strategic Objectives
 We sell our wine into two primary categories: Super Ultra-Premium ($25-49 per bottle retail price) and Luxury ($50+ per bottle retail price). With our focus on the DTC business, we plan to focus on the following sales channels:

• | Walk In Visitors: Dry Creek Valley is home to over 75 wineries and tasting rooms and draws from a large population base in and around the San Francisco Bay Area. These sales make up approximately 25% of our total sales and we work to convert these customers to longer term customers via our Wine Clubs.

• | Wine Club: Truett Hurst and VML Wine Clubs have over 6,000 member from which we generate approximately 75% of our annual sales. Wine Club members can choose from a variety of membership options and can also customize their membership to include specific wines or shipping timing. The most common memberships ship four times per year.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | E-Commerce: With a database of over 20,000 customers we regularly develop offerings of special lots, one time buys and end of vintage opportunities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Retail: We currently sell the Truett Hurst brand directly to several retailers including Total Wine and More and sell the VML brand to a select group of retailers via a traditional three tier distribution.

Wine Operations
 Brands
 We operate two tasting rooms and one winery where wine is produced from many varieties of grapes principally grown or purchased in Sonoma County’s Dry Creek Valley and Russian River Valley appellations. Established in 2007, Truett-Hurst was the first winery operation and brand that focuses on producing limited lots of super-premium wine from a range of varietals, including Zinfandel, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Noir, Petite Sirah and other unique red blends from grapes sourced from local growers in the Dry Creek Valley. Established in 2011, VML was the second winery operation and brand that focuses on producing limited lots of super-premium and ultra-premium wines from grapes purchased from local growers in the Russian River Valley. The primary varietals include Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, and Gewurztraminer. The Svengali brand was established most recently to focus entirely on a single Dry Creek Valley Syrah.
Property
 We own a 25-acre property located at 5610 Dry Creek Road, Healdsburg, California, of which approximately 15 acres is used for growing grapes. The remainder of the property is used for the Truett-Hurst and VML tasting rooms, retail sales space, and office space for support staff. Although we have maintained the proper permits to build a winery at this location and there is infrastructure, such as electricity and access to water, necessary to operate a winery on the property, we have not made the requisite capital expenditures to construct a building to house grape-crushing equipment and wine storage tanks. We believe that the property can be used to expand our wine-making operations in the future and provide better control over wine quality.
 We lease wine production space within a custom crush facility located in Santa Rosa, California. The lease commenced on April 15, 2017 and ended on June 15, 2018. The initial 14-month term has been renewed for an additional 12 month period as agreed to by both parties. Previously, we leased a winery located at 4035 Westside Road, Healdsburg, California, but vacated those premises prior to May 31, 2017. 
 Production
 The wine production space within the custom crush facility allows us to crush, ferment and oak barrel age approximately 700 tons (50,000 cases) of ultra-premium grapes annually, with capacity to increase to 1,000 tons with additional capital improvements. For increased production capacity, we outsource to a variety of specialist wineries and bottling facilities. We have been able to satisfy the production requirements to date and considers our sources to be adequate at this time. However, the inability of any of the suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect operations.
 We entered into a Transition Services Agreement with Precept to harvest and produce wine for Precept from the 2018 vintage and oversee blending and bottling of the bulk wine sold to Precept in the Precept Transaction. See Note 12 “Subsequent Events” for further information.

Grape and Wine Contracts
 The majority of annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each year’s harvest and from fruit harvested from our estate vineyards which normally begins in August and runs through October. In addition to purchasing grapes, we supplement our needs with bulk wine purchase contracts based on sales and production requirements. Depending upon overall demand and availability of bulk wine, we could experience shortages and/or increased prices.
 We enter into grape contracts with terms generally of one to four years, which requires payment of an agreed upon price per ton that varies according to the type of grape, its appellation and in certain cases, the vineyard block in which the grapes are grown. Contracts are typically terminable after a specified term, unless earlier mutually agreed by the parties.
 Vineyards Owned by Founders
 Certain of the Founders operate or farm vineyards. The grapes produced from these vineyards are sold to us at market prices, with the balances sold to other wineries. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8, “Commitments and Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding related party commitments.
Sources and Availability of Production Materials
 We utilize glass and other materials such as corks, capsules, labels and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our products. After grape purchases and associated production overhead, glass bottle costs are the next most significant component of the cost of sales. The glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of quality producers. We obtain glass requirements from a limited number of producers under supply arrangements. We have been able to satisfy production requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider the sources of supply to be adequate at this time. However, the inability of any of the glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our operations.
Seasonality
 There is seasonality in the growing, procurement and transportation of grapes. The wine industry typically experiences increased sales in October, November and December. Sales are typically higher upon the launch of a new product into the marketplace and when retailers promote brands through in-store displays and advertisements. We expect these trends to continue. 
Company Team and Culture
 Our team consists of seasoned professionals who have worked their way up through the industry often achieving senior level positions in noted wine companies such as the Brown-Forman Corporation, Gallo, Domaine Chandon, Kendall-Jackson, and Fetzer Vineyards.
 In addition to building a seasoned team of professionals and shaping the entrepreneurial culture, an important part of the ongoing strategy is to create partnerships with the best organizations and professionals in order to leverage core competencies in the most efficient, cost effective and profitable manner. We are proud of the corporate partnerships that have been created throughout the sales channels and believe we can build a business that can change the way consumers purchase and enjoy wine.
 Sales and Marketing
 We employ a relatively small full-time, in-house marketing, sales and customer service organization. The sales and marketing team uses a range of marketing strategies designed to build brand equity and increase sales. Strategies include, but are not limited to, market research, consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale materials, event sponsorship, on premise promotions, social media and public relations.

As a part of the sale of our Wholesale Business to Precept in August 2018, we sold our wholesale brands and, as a result our future sales will be comprised of sales through our DTC business. On a combined basis, the DTC segment represented approximately 27% of our net sales and 51% of our gross profit for the year ended June 30, 2018. DTC sales have high margins, typically include more expensive wines, and create a “halo effect” for our national brands. The remaining national brand segment is comprised of brands we have developed and own (VML, Truett Hurst and Svengali). We also sell these brands to on and off-premise regional and national retail chains, as well as independent restaurants, liquors stores, and grocery stores. 
 Competitive Environment
 All the segments we participate in are highly competitive. We compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength against domestic and multinational producers and distributors, some of which have greater resources than us, for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail stores, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention. Further, wine competes with other alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages.
 There are relatively few publicly traded beverage companies with significant wine operations and most also have beer and spirits divisions.
 Demand for wine in our market segments can rise and fall with general economic conditions. Our ability to respond to market demand, deliver a variety of wine styles, create and design innovative packaging combined with an effective distribution system will allow us to continue to penetrate the mainstream wine markets.
 Intellectual Property
 We protect proprietary rights through a variety of means and measures, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, contractual restrictions and technical measures. A number of brands are under registered trademarks. International trademark registrations are also maintained where it is appropriate to do so. Each of the U.S. trademark registrations is renewable indefinitely so long as we are making a bona fide usage of the trademark. Subsequent to the sale of the Wholesale Business on August 13, 2018, we have 3 registered material trademarks. 
Regulatory Environment
 The wine industry is part of the highly regulated U.S. liquor industry. While there have been significant relaxations over time, such as those arising following the Granholm v. Heald U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2005, the U.S. wine industry is still highly regulated. For example, we are able to ship wine directly now to consumers and businesses in 42 states, but must only work through traditional “three-tier” distributors in the remaining 8 states.
 The production and sale of wine is subject to extensive regulation by the United States Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and the California Liquor Control Commission. We are licensed by and meet the bonding requirements of each of these governmental agencies. Sales of wine are subject to federal alcohol tax, payable at the time wine is removed from the bonded area of the winery for shipment to customers or for sale in our tasting rooms.
 In conjunction with the signing of the 2018 Tax Reform Bill, the federal alcohol tax rate changed effective January 1, 2108. The previous rates of $1.07 per gallon for wines with alcohol content at or below 14% and $1.57 per gallon for wines above 14% but less than 21% has been modified to reflect the following tiered structure:
 For wines with alcohol content of 16% and under – ($.07 per gallon on first 30,000 gallons, $.17 per gallon from 30,001 – 130,000, $.535 per gallon from 130,001 – 750,000, $1.07 over 750,000)
 For wines with alcohol content between 16% - 21% - ($.57 per gallon on first 30,000 gallons, $.67 per gallon from 30,001 – 130,000, $1.035 per gallon from 130,001 – 750,000, $1.57 over 750,000)
 7

For wines with alcohol content between 21% - 24% ($2.15 per gallon on first 30,000 gallons, $2.25 per gallon from 30,001 – 130,000, $2.62 per gallon from 130,001 – 750,000, $3.15 over 750,000)
 Consumer direct sales are also subject to state regulation which governs the quantity and manner in which products can be shipped, delivered and excise taxes collected.
 As an agricultural processor, we are also regulated by Sonoma County and, as a producer of wastewater, by the state of California. We maintain all necessary permits.
 Prompted by growing government budget shortfalls and public reaction against alcohol abuse, Congress and many state legislatures are considering various proposals to impose additional excise taxes on the production and sale of alcoholic beverages, including table wines. Some of the excise tax rate increases being considered are substantial. The ultimate effects of such legislation, if passed, cannot be assessed accurately since the proposals are still in the discussion stage. Any increase in the taxes imposed on table wines can be expected to have a potentially adverse impact on overall sales of such products. However, the impact may not be proportionate to that experienced by producers of other alcoholic beverages and may not be the same in every state.
 Management is strongly focused on environmental stewardship and maintains a variety of policies and processes designed to protect the environment, the public and the consumers of our wine. Many of the expenses for protecting the environment are voluntary, however we are regulated by various local, state and federal agencies regarding environmental laws where the costs of these laws and requirements of these agencies are effectively integrated into regular operations and do not cause significant negative impacts or costs.
 We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We also believe that the cost of administration and compliance with, and liability under, such laws and regulations have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
 Employees
 As of June 30, 2018, we had 35 full time, 15 part time, and 4 seasonal employees. We hire part time and seasonal help as needed. All employees are located in the United States. We believe that future success will depend in large part on the ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, and sales and marketing personnel. None of the employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe relations with our employees are good.

Emerging Growth Company Status
 We were initially an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, enacted on April 5, 2012 (“JOBS Act”). For as long as we remained an “emerging growth company,” we could take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding shareholder advisory “say-on-pay” votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. We reached our fifth anniversary of our IPO as of June 30, 2018, and no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company’ under the JOBS Act.
Smaller Reporting Company
 Although we no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company” we are still able to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting obligations as a “smaller reporting company”. We became subject to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting company,” on the effective date of the IPO. The designation of being a “smaller reporting company” relieves us from some of the more detailed informational requirements of Regulation S-K.
