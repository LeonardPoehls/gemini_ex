ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Carbonite, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Carbonite", the "Company", "our", "we", or "us") provides data protection solutions including cloud, hybrid and on-premise backup and restore, disaster recovery as a service ("DRaaS") and email archiving. Our solutions provide powerful features packaged in a cost-effective, simple and secure manner and are designed to address the specific needs of small and medium-sized businesses ("SMBs") and consumers.
We were incorporated on February 10, 2005 as a Delaware corporation and our principal executive offices are located at Two Avenue de Lafayette, Boston, Massachusetts, 02111. We founded Carbonite on one simple idea: all computers need to be backed up, and in our always connected and highly mobile world, cloud backup is the ideal approach.
We derive the majority of our revenue from subscription fees and our consistently strong retention rates and scalable infrastructure help to support our growth. The remainder of our revenue is derived from software arrangements, which often contain multiple revenue elements, such as software licenses, hardware, professional services and post-contract customer support. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we generated revenue of $207.0 million, $136.6 million and $122.6 million, respectively. We continue to invest in customer acquisition because the market for our solutions is highly competitive and, as a result, our bookings have grown from $98.5 million in 2012 to $209.3 million in 2016. For a reconciliation of bookings to revenue for the last five years, see “Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data.”
Industry Trends
Trends on several fronts are fueling growth opportunities for Carbonite.
1

The first trend is the continued growth of the data protection market fueled by the proliferation of data, which the industry analyst firm International Data Corporation ("IDC") says is expanding at a 40-50% compound annual growth rate ("CAGR").1
IDC predicts the worldwide disk-based data protection and recovery ("DBDP") market will grow to $16.6 billion by 2020.2 Included in the 2020 DBDP forecast are the $8.4 billion worldwide data protection and recovery software ("DP&R") market, in which IDC projects cloud-based solutions to grow at almost three times the rate of on-premise solutions, at 12.1% and 4.3% CAGR respectively,1 and the $4.1 billion purpose-built backup appliances ("PBBA") market. Together, DP&R and PBBA, Carbonite’s primary lines of business, represent 72% or $12 billion of the worldwide DBDP market.
The second trend is threats to data. The number of cyberattacks known as “Ransomware” grew rapidly over the past 12 months. The FBI defines ransomware as a type of malware installed on a computer or server that encrypts the files, making them inaccessible until a specified ransom is paid.5
The FBI reported that ransomware “skyrocketed” in Q1 of 2016, costing businesses $209 million during the first three months of the year, compared to $24 million in all of 2015.3 The total cost for 2016 is expected to exceed $1 billion and this reflects only those incidents that are reported.4 In order to avoid bad press and reputational damage, many ransomware incidents are not reported. 
In September 2016, the FBI issued a public service announcement stressing the importance of regular data backups and verification of the integrity of those backups as a defense to ransomware, stating that “backups are critical in ransomware incidents,” and “backups may be the best way to recover your critical data.”5 We expect this trend to drive adoption of backup solutions as businesses and individuals look for solutions to protect their data to avoid falling prey to criminals.
Finally, the industry analyst firm Gartner estimates the DRaaS market will nearly triple to $3.4 billion in 2019.6 According to Gartner, mid-market drivers for DRaaS include improved affordability and functionality.
We believe data growth and data threats will continue to drive the need for data protection and that our solutions position us well to capitalize on this growth opportunity.

Our Key Competitive Strengths

We believe that our key competitive strengths include the following:
Proprietary backup architecture. Our entire infrastructure is designed and optimized for data protection, which is a low transaction speed, high volume, write mostly application. We believe that our average storage costs per subscriber are lower than those realized by typical general purpose data center storage systems, providing us with lower cost of service and greater return on investment.
Heterogeneous environment support. Our EVault solutions have been architected to use proprietary “agents” that run on a variety of operating platforms, including Windows, Linux, VMware, Oracle, IBM AIX and HP-UX, to ensure that medium-sized businesses can securely backup and restore all their important data.
Brand awareness. We believe that we have among the highest brand awareness in the cloud backup market. We promote our brand through our multi-channel marketing program, which includes a broad presence in radio, online display advertising, print advertising, paid and natural search, and an affiliate and reseller network.
Distribution. Our sales network is designed to sell large volumes of our solutions to SMB customers. To penetrate the extensive and diverse population of SMBs, we have invested in recruiting and onboarding a network of sales channel partners including distributors, value-added resellers and managed service providers (“MSPs”). We believe the breadth and diversity of our channel partner relationships, coupled with our internal direct sales capabilities provide a competitive advantage when reaching SMBs. 

Significant intellectual property portfolio. We have a significant intellectual property portfolio relating to our solutions, including 33 patents and 24 patents pending. CARBONITE is a registered trademark in the U.S. and in over 40 other countries, including countries in the European Union.
Encryption and data security. We use sophisticated encryption technology to ensure the privacy of our customers’ stored files. We encrypt files using a secure key before the files leave the customers' computer and transmit the encrypted files over the internet to one of our secure data centers. Customers’ files remain encrypted on our servers to guard against unauthorized access. We employ outside security analysis firms, including anti-hacking specialists, to review and test our defenses and internal procedures.

Comprehensive customer support. We believe that our customer support is more comprehensive than that offered by our primary competitors in the cloud backup market and aids in our customer retention. Telephone, live chat, and email customer support are included in our subscription fee.

Our Proprietary Technology
At the core of our offerings is proprietary technology that allows us to offer highly scalable data protection solutions to our end customers, and as a platform for MSP partners to offer to their customers as a white-labeled offering. This technology is installed on protected systems, running in the customers' environment, and includes server software, web-based monitoring, control, and account management tools. We believe that simple, centralized, web-based control of our solutions improves the user experience both for end-users and for our partners.
We invest heavily in the development of our technologies. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we spent $33.3 million, $28.1 million and $24.1 million, respectively, on research and development. Our proprietary technologies are fundamental to our value proposition as they enable us to deliver solutions that are scalable, reliable and cost effective.
Marketing and Sales
Our marketing and sales efforts are focused on three primary goals: acquiring customers at a low cost, retaining existing customers, and building brand awareness. Our advertising reinforces our brand by emphasizing ease of use, affordability, security and reliability. We use radio advertising, online display advertising, print advertising, paid search, direct marketing, and affiliate and reseller marketing. Our public relations efforts include engaging the traditional press, new media, industry influencers and social networks. Our sales model is designed to sell large volumes of our solutions to SMBs globally, both directly and through our indirect network of partners which includes distributors, value-added resellers, and managed service providers.
Marketing. Our customers come from the following primary sources: SMBs who buy our solutions directly from our website, our inside sales team, or from our network of partners, and consumers who sign up for Carbonite backup solutions on our website in response to our direct marketing campaigns. We support our sales network with a marketing approach that leverages our established brand to drive market awareness and demand generation among the broad population of SMBs and consumers. Our marketing efforts are designed to attract prospective customers and enroll them as paying customers, either through immediate sale, free trials or communication of the benefits of our solutions and development of ongoing relationships.
Channel distribution. To further penetrate the extensive and diverse population of SMBs, we have and will continue to invest in our network of sales channel partners. Our network of sales channel partners includes distributors, value-added resellers and retailers and is designed to sell large volumes of our relatively low-priced solutions to SMB customers.
Retention. Our retention efforts are focused on establishing and maintaining long-term relationships with our customers by delivering a compelling customer experience and superior value, communicating regularly with customers through email, on-site messaging, and other media, and creating positive interactions with our customer support team. We monitor developing trends in subscription durations, renewals, and customer satisfaction to maximize our customer retention. We offer incentives to customers to purchase multi-year subscriptions, which we believe helps to increase our retention. As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 24%, 27% and 25%, respectively, of our total subscription bookings were for multi-year contracts.

Intellectual Property
We believe the strength of our brand and the functionality of our software help differentiate us from our competitors. Our success therefore depends on our ability to protect our technologies and intellectual property, which allows us to move and store vast amounts of customer data. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions. Carbonite, the Carbonite Logo, ZAMANDA, MAILSTORE and EVAULT, as well as other marks, are registered trademarks of Carbonite, Inc. in numerous countries throughout the world. The Carbonite trademark is subject to registrations covering over 40 countries. Carbonite also has additional registrations and/or pending applications for additional marks in the U.S. and/or other countries, including but not limited to “Carbonite The Better Backup Plan”, “Back it up. Get it back”, “Because Your Life is On Your Computer” Logo, "Carbonite" and the Green Dot Logo, Carbonite Lock Logo, the Z logo and Chinese character representations for Carbonite. In addition, we have 33 issued patents, expiring at various times between 2021 and 2031, and 24 pending patent applications in the U.S. and internationally that cover both our technical infrastructure and our key usability and design concepts.
Competition
Our market is rapidly evolving due to technological advances that are driving changes in the way SMBs operate. Over the past few years, competition has intensified, and we expect this to continue with market consolidation, the introduction of new technologies, and introduction of new market entrants. We compete against many companies across the data protection, disaster recovery and storage industries, ranging from those who provide a wide array of IT services, to those who provide only a specific business continuity product, to distributors and resellers. We expect many of our actual and potential competitors and solutions to change as we expand further into the SMB market and as the markets we compete in continue to evolve. 
We believe key factors to successfully compete in any of our markets include ease of installation and use, value, cloud storage, data security, reliability, and brand reputation. We believe that Carbonite competes favorably with respect to each of the key factors by providing powerful, yet simple solutions. Our offerings are easy-to-use, affordable, secure, include a variety of storage capacity options, and enable anytime, anywhere access to files. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 820 full-time and 20 part-time employees. Of our full-time employees, 330 were in operations and support, 193 were in sales and marketing, 153 were in research and development, and 144 were in general and administrative functions. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Subsequent Events
Credit Facility Amendment
On January 30, 2017, we entered into a fourth amendment to the Credit Facility (as defined within Note 15 - Revolving Credit Facility) with Silicon Valley Bank (the "2017 Amendment"), which increased the Credit Facility in the amount of $15.0 million to a total credit limit of $40.0 million. The 2017 Amendment also included certain changes to the definitions and calculations of financial covenants. On January 31, 2017, $39.2 million was drawn from the Credit Facility, and was used to partially fund the acquisition of Double-Take Software, Inc. (“Double-Take”).
Acquisition
On January 31, 2017, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Vero Parent, Inc. (“Vero Parent”), the sole stockholder of Double-Take, and Vision Solutions, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vero Parent, pursuant to which, simultaneously with the execution of the Agreement, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Double-Take for a purchase price of $65,250,000, which was paid $59,750,000 in cash and $5,500,000 by the delivery of 332,326 shares of the Company’s common stock. Of the $59.8 million of cash consideration, $39.2 million was drawn from our credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank.
We are in the process of gathering information to complete our preliminary valuation of certain assets and liabilities acquired as part of the transaction to complete acquisition accounting.
