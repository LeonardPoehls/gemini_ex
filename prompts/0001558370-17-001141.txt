     Industry Overview
     The commercial aircraft and business jet cabin interior products industries encompass a broad range of products and services, including aircraft seating, food and beverage preparation and storage systems, galley  and interior monument systems, passenger and crew oxygen storage, oxygen distribution and delivery systems, lavatory systems, wastewater management systems, lighting systems, overhead bins, as well as interior reconfigurations and a variety of other engineering, design, integration, installation, retrofit and certification services. 
     Historically, the aircraft cabin interior products industry has derived revenues from five sources:
    
· | New installation programs in which airlines purchase new equipment directly from interior equipment manufacturers. The airframe manufacturer receives the equipment and installs it on these newly produced aircraft prior to aircraft delivery;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Retrofit programs in which airlines purchase new interior furnishings and engineering services to upgrade the interiors of aircraft already in service;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Refurbishment programs in which airlines purchase components and services to improve the appearance and functionality of their cabin interior equipment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Equipment to upgrade the functionality or appearance of the aircraft interior; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Replacement spare parts.
--+-------------------------

      The retrofit and refurbishment cycles for commercial aircraft cabin interior products differ by product category. Aircraft seating typically has a refurbishment cycle of one to two years and a retrofit cycle of four to eight years. Food and beverage preparation and storage equipment is periodically upgraded or repaired, and requires a continual flow of spare parts, but may be retrofitted only once or twice during the useful life of an aircraft.

 Based on industry sources and studies, we estimate that during 2016, the global commercial and business jet cabin interior products industry, for the principal products of the type which we manufacture, exclusive of service revenues, had annual sales of approximately $5.0 billion. We estimate that the total worldwide installed base of commercial and general aviation aircraft cabin interior products for the principal products of the type which we manufacture, valued at replacement prices, was approximately $30.8 billion as of December 31, 2016.
     During 2016, global air traffic increased by 6.3% as compared with global traffic increases of 6.5% in 2015 and 6.0% in 2014. The overall increase in global traffic demand from 2014 through 2016 reflect the global macroeconomic environment. The Airline Monitor 2017 forecast projects global passenger traffic to increase approximately 6.0% and capacity growth of approximately 6.0% each as compared to 2016.
     IATA expects the global airline industry to generate a profit of approximately $35.6 billion in 2016, an increase of approximately 1% compared to 2015. Overall performance in 2016 has been positively impacted by strong passenger traffic growth of approximately 6.3%, record load factors of approximately 80.5% reflecting disciplined capacity management, positive macroeconomic factors, and improved airline offerings that stimulate demand. The record industry profits were delivered despite modest reduction in yields as compared with 2015. For 2017, IATA expects global profits of $29.8 billion, a decrease of 16.3% as compared to 2016 driven primarily by higher fuel and labor costs. 
     The airlines have substantially strengthened their balance sheets over the past several years through operating profits and by accessing capital markets. As a result, we believe airline balance sheets are much stronger than in any time in the past ten years. 
     Approximately 653 business jets were delivered in 2016 versus 647 business jets in 2015 and 710 business jets in 2014. 
     Other factors relevant to the industries we serve include the following:
     Long-Term Growth in Worldwide Fleet. According to the Airline Monitor, new deliveries of large commercial aircraft increased to 1,436 aircraft in 2016 driven primarily by the ramp up of Airbus’ A350 aircraft. This compares to 1,397 aircraft in 2015 and 1,352 in 2014. According to the Airline Monitor, new aircraft deliveries are expected to total 1,490 in 2017 and 1,600 in 2018. Worldwide air traffic is expected to grow by approximately 6.0% in 2017 and the Airline Monitor has forecasted revenue passenger miles to increase at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 4.8% during the 2016-2031 period, increasing from 4.5 trillion miles in 2016 to approximately 9.1 trillion miles by 2031. As a result, the Airline Monitor expects the worldwide fleet of commercial jet aircraft to increase by approximately 73% from approximately 25,861 regional, single-aisle and twin-aisle aircraft at December 31, 2016 to approximately 44,659 aircraft at December 31, 2031. 
     Wide-Body Aircraft Deliveries. Deliveries of wide-body, long-haul aircraft constitute an increasing share of total new aircraft deliveries and are an increasing percentage of the worldwide fleet. Wide-body aircraft represented approximately 28% of all new commercial aircraft (excluding regional jets) delivered over the four-year period ended December 31, 2016. According to the Airline Monitor, 401 new wide-body aircraft were delivered in 2016 and approximately 375 are expected to be delivered in 2017. The Airline Monitor also predicts that nearly 4,835 twin-aisle aircraft will be delivered over the 2017-2027 timeframe or approximately 440 wide-body and super wide-body aircraft per year, which is 9.7% higher, on average, as compared to 2016 deliveries. The foundations of this growth are the Boeing 787, Boeing 777X and Airbus A350 two engine aircraft which replace older and less fuel efficient wide-body aircraft. These aircraft also support new demand by opening smaller markets to long range nonstop flights.   
     Existing Installed Base. According to industry sources, the world's active commercial passenger aircraft fleet consisted of approximately 25,861 aircraft as of December 31, 2016. Additionally, based on industry sources, there are approximately 18,865 business jets currently in service. Based on such fleet numbers, we

estimate that the total worldwide installed base of commercial and general aviation aircraft cabin interior products for the principal products of the type which we manufacture, valued at replacement prices, was approximately $30.8 billion as of December 31, 2016. The size of the installed base is expected to increase as a result of the growth in the world wide fleet and is expected to generate additional and continued demand for retrofit, refurbishment and spare parts.
     Engineering Services Markets. Historically, the airlines have relied primarily on their own in-house engineering resources to provide engineering, design, integration and installation services, as well as services related to repairing or replacing cabin interior products that have become damaged or otherwise non-functional. Cabin interior product configurations have become increasingly more sophisticated and the airline industry more globally competitive. The airlines have increasingly outsourced a number of these services in order to introduce highly branded, optimized density and contemporary interiors in sync with market cycles. As noted above, the interiors retrofit cycle runs in four to eight year cycles. The ability of an airline to source expert engineering services is an increasingly essential factor in their ability to offer a competitive interior product in their markets.
     Outsourced services include:
    
· | Interior concept development, engineering, design, integration, integrated project management, installation and certification services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Modifications and reconfigurations for commercial aircraft including passenger-to-freighter conversions and related kits; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Services related to the support of product upgrades.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

      Competitive Strengths
     We believe that we have a strong competitive position attributable to a number of factors, including the following:
     Focus on Innovation and New Product Development. Our aircraft cabin interior products businesses are engaged in extensive product development and marketing efforts for both new and existing products. We believe, based on our experience in the industry, that we are a technological and systems integration leader in the cabin interior products industry. The success of these and other new product development efforts are expected to increase demand for our products in both newly purchased aircraft and in aftermarket retrofits. Our focus on continuous development has allowed us to grow our backlog and improve the product mix of our current backlog. Newly introduced products include a broad range of amenities such as luxurious first class cabins (offering high privacy and high density seats) with features such as mini-bars, closets, flat screen TVs, digital light-emitting diode (“LED”) mood lighting, electric lie-flat seating, Pulse Oxygen™ gaseous passenger oxygen systems for the Boeing 787, 777X and Airbus A350, next-generation galley systems for the Airbus A350, the new award winning and market leading Essence™ suite of food and beverage preparation and storage equipment, electric fully berthing business jet seating, lightweight, lower maintenance wastewater systems for business and commercial jets and a full range of business and executive jet seating. We recently introduced our new Meridian® main cabin seating platform, which we believe is the industry’s lightest full-featured seat that significantly reduces cost of ownership, simplifies maintenance and increases overall passenger living space. We also recently introduced an update to our digital LED lighting system for the Boeing 737 Sky Interior aircraft. This innovative, lightweight LED system features adjustable lighting with full spectrum color capabilities, providing superior cabin ambiance and unprecedented lighting control. Market acceptance of our LED lighting systems has continued to gain strength, and since 2012 we have been receiving orders from various airlines to retrofit their Boeing 737, 757, 767 and 777 aircraft with our LED lighting systems.

 As of December 31, 2016, we had 2,226 employees in engineering, research and development and program management. We believe our engineering, research and development efforts and our on-site technicians at both the airlines and airframe manufacturers enable us to play a leading role in developing and introducing innovative products to meet emerging industry trends, and thereby gain early entrant advantages.
     Diverse Product Offering and Broad Domestic and International Customer Base. We provide a comprehensive line of products and services to a broad customer base. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Boeing and Airbus each accounted for approximately 13% of our consolidated revenues (no other customer represented more than 10% of consolidated revenues). Our commercial aircraft and business jet segments have a broad range of over 300 principal customers, including all of the world’s major airlines, commercial aircraft and business jet manufacturers and completion centers. We believe that our broad product offering and large customer base make us less vulnerable to the loss of any one customer or program. We have continued to expand our available products and services based on our belief that the airline industry increasingly will seek an integrated approach to the design, development, integration, installation, testing and sourcing of aircraft cabin interior equipment. 
    
     Large Installed Base. We have a large installed base of commercial and general aviation aircraft cabin interior products for the principal products of the type which we manufacture, valued at replacement prices, of approximately $13.4 billion as of December 31, 2016. Based on our experience in the industry, we believe our installed base is substantially larger than that of each of our competitors. We believe that our large installed base is a strategic advantage, as airlines tend to purchase aftermarket products and services, including spare parts, retrofit and refurbishment programs, from the original supplier. As a result, we expect our large installed base to generate continued aftermarket revenue as airlines continue to maintain, evolve and reconfigure their aircraft cabin interiors. 
     Increased Airframe Content and Diversified Backlog. Approximately ten years ago we began to leverage our deep understanding of aircraft interior systems to develop a range of new aircraft interior products that deliver differentiated value for Airbus and Boeing at point of sale, and the airlines in service. During 2011, Boeing selected our modular lavatory systems as standard equipment for Boeing’s 737 NG family of airplanes, as well as the Boeing 737 MAX. The award was initially valued in excess of $800 million, exclusive of retrofit orders. This innovative system has become standard equipment on these aircraft and will be the sole source equipment on the 737 MAX when it enters service in 2017. Our proprietary lavatory systems create the opportunity to add up to six incremental passenger seats on each 737 NG / MAX airplane.
     We have also been selected by Boeing to manufacture our LED cabin lighting systems for the Boeing 737 Sky Interior aircraft. This has facilitated our growth of lighting retrofits for both narrow-body and wide-body aircraft where we have won several awards as we continue to offer all-LED lighting throughout the cabin into the existing worldwide fleet of aircraft. To date, we have been selected by Boeing to manufacture our patented Pulse OxygenTM system and passenger service units for the 787, 777X and 747-8, and we have been selected by Airbus to manufacture our next generation galley systems and our patented passenger oxygen delivery system for the A350. Additionally, we have been selected by major business jet

manufacturers to provide vacuum wastewater systems. As of December 31, 2016, the programs we have won are currently expected to generate approximately $5.6 billion in revenues over time, and are expected to significantly increase our content per aircraft type; however, only a small portion of these programs are included in our reported booked backlog as of December 31, 2016. This effort to develop and market new interior systems directly to the OEMs is important to us as it represents a significant potential increase in the dollar value of our products on each such aircraft type. It also offsers significant aftermarket opportunities through retrofits, repairs and spares.
     Proven Certification Capabilities and Experience with a Complex Regulatory Environment. The airline industry is heavily regulated and we have a long history and extensive experience with the complex regulatory environments in which we operate and believe this enables us to efficiently obtain the required approvals for new products and services. The Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) prescribes standards and licensing requirements for manufacturers and sellers of many aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation cabin interior products, and licenses component repair stations within the United States. Comparable agencies, such as the European Aviation Safety Agency (the “EASA”), the Japanese Civil Aviation Board (the “JCAB”), and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (the “CAAC”), prescribe standards, establish licensing requirements and regulate these matters in other countries. In addition, designing new products to meet existing regulatory requirements and retrofitting products to comply with new regulatory and airframe requirements can be both expensive and time consuming. Our proven ability to consistently conceptualize, design, manufacture and certify highly complex interiors for new and retrofit aircraft applications in compressed lead times to regulatory and airframe requirements is a key competitive strength in our market.
     Growth Opportunities
     We believe that we will benefit from the following industry trends:
     Growth of Wide-Body Aircraft Fleet. New aircraft deliveries of wide-body aircraft are expected to continue to grow over the long term, reflecting the expected growth in revenue passenger miles over the 2017-2031 period and retirements of older, less fuel efficient aircraft. The growth in the wide-body aircraft global fleet is significant to us because wide-body aircraft require up to six-to-ten times the dollar value content of the principal products of the type which we manufacture as compared to narrow-body aircraft. For example, wide-body aircraft carry up to three or four times the number of seats as narrow-body aircraft and have multiple classes of service, including super first class compartments and first class and business class configurations. In addition, aircraft cabin crews on wide-body aircraft flights may make and serve between 300 and 900 meals, brew and serve more than 2,000 cups of coffee and serve more than 200 glasses of wine on a single flight, thereby generating substantial demand for seating products and food and beverage preparation and storage equipment, as well as extensive oxygen storage, distribution and delivery systems and lighting systems. 
     Growth of Boeing and Airbus Narrow-Body Aircraft Fleet. New aircraft deliveries of Boeing’s 737 NG and Airbus’s A320neo are expected to continue to grow over the long term, reflecting the expected growth in revenue passenger miles over the 2017-2030 period and retirements of older, less fuel-efficient aircraft. For example, both Boeing and Airbus have increased their narrow body production outputs from over 34 aircraft per month in 2011 to over 42 aircraft per month in 2016 and have production schedules and backlog to deliver in excess of 57 aircraft per month in 2019. This growth is significant to us as we have market leading installed base shares on both the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 platforms.
     Worldwide Aircraft Fleet Creates Demand for Aftermarket Products. The size of the worldwide aircraft fleet is important to us as the proper maintenance of the fleet generates ongoing demand for spare parts and refurbishment retrofits. Our substantial existing installed base of products typically generates continued retrofit, replacement, upgrade, refurbishment, repair and spare parts revenue as airlines maintain their aircraft interiors. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 36% and 40%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from the aftermarket. In addition, aftermarket revenues are generally driven by 

 
  8

 
aircraft usage, and as such, have historically tended to recover more quickly than revenues from OEMs. As used in this Form 10-K, aftermarket sales include sales to support existing commercial and business jet fleets. We believe that there are substantial growth opportunities for retrofit programs for the wide-body aircraft that service international routes and that the major global airlines will need to invest in cabin interiors for their international fleets or face the prospect of losing market share on their international routes. Additionally, the expected growth in the worldwide fleet will serve to increase the size of our installed base.
     Backlog Aided by Aftermarket Demand from International Airlines Retrofitting Existing Fleets. We believe that many major international airlines are in the process of planning cabin interior upgrade programs. This activity is expected to continue to be driven by the age of the existing cabin interiors, commonality with new aircraft type interiors, as well as the desire by many of the leading international carriers to achieve a competitive advantage by investing in cabin interior products that incorporate leading comfort amenities, thereby improving passenger loads and yields, or that reduce airline operating costs by reducing maintenance costs and/or providing lower weight and fuel burn. We believe that as international traffic continues to grow, the life cycle of premium products, such as lie-flat international business class seats and the products comprising our super first class suites, will continue to compress as airlines seek greater competitive advantage through state-of-the-art cabin interior products. We believe our ability to develop unique interior concepts, design, manufacture and certify these concepts in a compressed lead time to comply with international regulatory requirements supports expansion of these activities.
     Growth in New Aircraft Introductions Leads to New Cabin Interior Product Introductions and Major Retrofit Opportunities. According to Airbus, 44 customers have placed 818 orders for new A350 aircraft. According to Boeing, 64 customers have placed orders for 1,200 of its new B787 wide-body aircraft and seven customers have placed 306 orders for new B777X aircraft. We believe the airlines often use the introduction into service of a new aircraft fleet type to introduce next generation cabin interior products. In such cases, we believe airlines will also invest in programs to retrofit their existing fleets to incorporate these new interior products and configurations in order to enhance their revenue and/or cost advantages realized on the new fleets and to maintain product and service commonality. 
     Long-Term Growth in Business Jet and VIP Aircraft Markets. Business jet deliveries totaled 653 aircraft in 2016 and increased approximately 1% in 2016 as compared to 2015; business jet deliveries in 2015 totaled 647 aircraft and were down 8.9% as compared to 2014. According to industry sources, new business jet deliveries in 2017 through 2019 are expected to decline slightly before a new up cycle begins in 2020 driven by the introduction of new large aircraft from Dassault and Bombardier and new mid-size platforms from Cessna. The growth of the very large aircraft segment is important to us as the ship set content for seating, divans and accent lighting is three times that of a smaller business jet.

      Commercial Aircraft Segment 
     Seating Products. We believe, based on our experience in the industry, that we are the world's leading manufacturer of aircraft seats, offering a wide selection of first class, business class, tourist class and regional aircraft seats. A typical seat manufactured and sold by us includes the seat frame, cushions, armrests, tray table and a variety of optional features such as adjustable lumbar supports, electrical actuation systems, footrests, reading lights, head/neck supports, and other comfort amenities. We also integrate a wide variety of in-flight entertainment equipment into our seats, which is supplied to us by our customers or third-party suppliers. 
     First and Business Class Seats. Based upon major airlines' program selection and our backlog, we believe we are the leading worldwide manufacturer of first and business class seats. Our line of first class lie-flat seats incorporates full electric actuation, an electric ottoman, privacy panels and sidewall-mounted tables. We leverage our differentiated expertise in executive seating, divans, cabinetry, lighting, environmental controls and reliable use of exotic materials to develop these exclusive environments. Our business class seats incorporate features developed over 25 years of seating design. We have led this sector of the industry since the development and delivery of the industry’s first mass produced lie flat seat in 2001. We offer the widest array of business class platforms in the industry to support airlines’ differing requirements for business class zone density. The business class seats include electrical or mechanical actuation, PC power ports, personal entertainment device connectivity, gaming headsets, individual video monitors, leg rests, adjustable lumbar cushions, four and six-way adjustable headrests and fiber optic reading and accent lights. The first and business class products are substantially more expensive than tourist class seats due to these luxury accoutrements. Our deep understanding of airframe and system interfaces and ability to certify these suites and cabins within required lead-times, supports our market design and manufacturing capabilities.
     Tourist Class and Regional Jet Seats. We believe, based on our installed base, that we are a leading worldwide manufacturer of tourist class seats and regional aircraft seats. We believe our Pinnacle® coach class seat has become the industry's most popular seat platform for single-aisle aircraft since its launch in late 2009. We believe the seat improves comfort and offers significantly improved passenger living space as well as benefiting the airlines with simplified maintenance and spare parts purchasing. Pinnacle® was engineered for use across the entire single-aisle aircraft fleet. In 2015, we introduced our new patented Meridian® main cabin seating platform for single aisle aircraft, which we believe is the industry’s lightest full-featured seat. The Meridian® seat platform utilizes advanced proprietary technologies that we believe significantly reduce cost of ownership, simplify maintenance and increase overall passenger living space and comfort. Since its launch, the Meridian® has received launch orders in excess of 1,400 aircraft. In 2016, we introduced the Aspire® seating platform for the main cabin of twin aisle aircraft. The Aspire® seat is a B/E Aerospace proprietary design that incorporates B/E’s patented technologies and has been engineered to

provide airline passengers with enhanced living space and increased leg and shin clearance as well as a high level of integration with advanced in-flight entertainment systems.
     Spares. Aircraft seats require regularly scheduled maintenance in the course of normal passenger use. Airlines depend on seat manufacturers and secondary suppliers to provide spare parts and kit upgrade programs. As a result, a significant market exists for spare parts and kit upgrades. We believe we offer unique engineering, planning and logistics services to our industry via our Integrated Materials Management aftermarket support platform. This service is enabled by the industry’s only manufacturing sites and supply chains dedicated to seat aftermarket support. The ability to deliver best in class logistics and material services lowers cost for the airlines and raises customer satisfaction.
     Food and Beverage and Preparation and Storage Equipment. We believe, based on our experience in the industry, that we are the leading manufacturer of aircraft coffee and beverage makers. We manufacture a broad line of coffee makers, including the Essence® line of beverage makers, coffee warmers and water boilers. We also manufacture a cappuccino/espresso maker. We believe, based on our experience in the industry, that we are the leading manufacturer of a broad line of specialized ovens, including high efficiency convection ovens, steam ovens and warming ovens. Our DS Steam OvenTM uses a method of preparing in-flight food by maintaining constant temperature and moisture in the food. Our DS Steam OvenTM addresses the airlines' need to provide a wider range of food offerings than can be prepared by convection ovens. We believe, based on our experience in the industry, that we are the worldwide industry leader in the design, manufacture and supply of commercial aircraft refrigeration equipment. We manufacture self-contained wine and beverage chillers, refrigerators/freezers and galley air chilling systems. 
     Oxygen Delivery Systems. We believe, based on our experience in the industry, that we are the leading manufacturer of oxygen storage, distribution and delivery systems for both commercial and business jet aircraft. We have the capability to both produce all required components and to fully integrate overhead passenger service units with either chemical or gaseous oxygen equipment. Our oxygen equipment has been approved for use on all Boeing and Airbus aircraft and is also found on essentially all general aviation and VIP aircraft. The Boeing 787 was the first aircraft equipped with a passenger oxygen system using our advanced Pulse OxygenTM and passenger service unit technology. Boeing has awarded us a sole source contract for the installation of the Pulse Oxygen™ system on its new 777X platform. We also provide similar technology for passenger and crew oxygen systems for the Airbus A350. We have also been selected by both Boeing and Airbus to provide installed lavatory oxygen as their preferred line-fit solution for all platforms.
     Interior Structures. Interior Structures includes galley systems and lavatory systems. Our innovative, modular approach to the design of galley systems allows the airlines to select galley positions and configurations for their specific operational needs, while minimizing total aircraft system weight. We provide next generation galley systems for the Airbus A350 aircraft, which is designed to accommodate the aircraft’s “flex zones” allowing airlines to select from a wide range of galley configurations. Our modular lavatory system utilizes our patented Spacewall® technology, which frees up floor space in the cabin, creating the opportunity to add up to six incremental passenger seats on each airplane. The modular lavatory systems integrate our technologically advanced Aircraft Ecosystems® vacuum toilet, long-life LED lighting and tamper proof state-of-the-art lavatory oxygen system. We believe our Aircraft Ecosystems® vacuum toilets have 25% greater reliability than existing systems and allow components to be replaced in a few minutes, as compared to up to an hour for existing systems. Our innovative modular lavatory system has become standard equipment on all Boeing 737s, as well as the 737 MAX which enters service in 2017. We believe that retrofit demand for our lavatory systems could be substantial. We have also entered the vacuum wastewater system market. Our vacuum wastewater system incorporates a proprietary design which we believe eliminates the primary cause of failure which plagues other vacuum systems. In addition, our systems include advanced proprietary components and systems that we believe will significantly lower the overall cost of ownership, simplify maintenance and improve lavatory hygiene. 
     Engineering, Design, Integration, Installation and Certification Services. We believe, based on our experience in the industry, that we are a leading supplier of engineering, design, integration, installation and

certification services for commercial aircraft passenger cabin interiors. We also offer our customers’ in-house capabilities to design, manage, integrate, test and certify reconfigurations and modifications for commercial aircraft and to manufacture related products, including engineering kits and interface components. We provide a broad range of interior reconfiguration services which enable airlines to modify the cabin layout, install telecommunications and entertainment equipment, and relocate galleys, lavatories, overhead bins, and crew rest compartments. The expertise and resources of our engineering and certifications unit is embedded in our major interiors densification campaigns, new cabin systems and product developments. The ability to leverage our unique knowledge of the aircraft electrical, environmental and stress environments allow us to optimize platform development to comply with challenging manufacturing and certification requirements.
     We estimate that, as of December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate installed base of products produced by our commercial aircraft segment, valued at replacement prices, of approximately $11.0 billion. 
     Business Jet Segment
     We believe, based on our experience in the industry, that we are a leading manufacturer of a broad product line of furnishings for business jets. We believe we originated what is today’s market for “Super First Class” suites and cabins twelve years ago. Our products include a complete line of business jet seating and sofa products, including electric fully berthing lie-flat seats, both fluorescent and LED direct and indirect lighting, air valves and oxygen delivery systems as well as sidewalls, bulkheads, credenzas, closets, galley structures, lavatories, wastewater systems, de-icing systems, cabin management systems and tables. We have the capability to provide complete interior packages for business jets and executive VIP or head-of-state aircraft interiors, including design services, interior components and program management services. Our product portfolio also includes premium lightweight seats for rotorcraft airframes for civil and military applications. 
     Our business jet segment, which has had decades of experience in equipping executive, VIP and head-of-state aircraft, is the leading manufacturer of super first class cabin interior products for commercial wide-body aircraft. Super first class products incorporate a broad range of amenities such as luxurious first class cabins with appointments such as lie-flat seating, mini-bars, closets, flat screen televisions and mood lighting, which, until recently, were found only in VIP and head-of-state aircraft. 
     We estimate that, as of December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate installed base of business jet and super first class equipment, valued at replacement prices, of approximately $2.4 billion. 
     Research, Development and Engineering 
     We work closely with commercial airlines, business jet and aerospace original equipment manufacturers and global leasing companies to improve existing products and identify customers' emerging needs. Our expenditures in research, development and engineering totaled $290.7 million, $274.4 million and $284.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing 9.9%, 10.1% and 10.9% of revenues, respectively, for each of those years. We employed 2,226 professionals in engineering, research and development and program management as of December 31, 2016. We believe, based on our experience in the industry, that we have the largest engineering organization in the cabin interior products industry, with mechanical, electrical, human machine interface and software design skills, as well as substantial expertise in program management, materials composition and custom cabin interior layout design and certification.      Customers, Marketing and Competition 
     The commercial aircraft cabin interior products market is relatively fragmented, with a number of competitors in each of the individual product categories. Due to the global nature of the commercial aerospace industry, competition comes from both U.S. and foreign manufacturers. However, as aircraft cabin interiors have become increasingly sophisticated and technically complex, airlines have demanded higher 

 
  12

 
levels of engineering support and customer service than many smaller cabin interior products suppliers can provide. At the same time, airlines have recognized that cabin interior product suppliers must be able to integrate a wide range of products, including sophisticated electronic components, such as video and live broadcast TV, particularly in wide-body aircraft. 
     We market and sell our commercial aircraft products directly to virtually all of the world's major airlines, aircraft leasing companies and airframe manufacturers. Airlines select manufacturers of cabin interior products primarily on the basis of custom design capabilities, product quality and performance, on-time delivery, after-sales customer service, product support and price. We market our thermal and power management products and services directly to first tier defense manufacturers, aerospace OEMs, their suppliers and the airlines. 
     We believe that airlines prefer our integrated worldwide marketing approach, which is focused by airline and encompasses our entire product line. Led by senior executives, teams representing each product line serve designated airlines that together account for the vast majority of the purchases of products manufactured by our commercial aircraft and business jet segments that serve these customers. Our teams have developed customer-specific strategies to meet each airline's product and service needs. We also staff "on-site" customer engineers at major airlines and airframe manufacturers to represent our entire product line and to work closely with customers to develop specifications for each successive generation of products required by the airlines. These engineers help customers integrate our wide range of cabin interior products and assist in obtaining the applicable regulatory certification for each particular product or cabin configuration. Through our on-site customer engineers, we expect to be able to more efficiently design and integrate products that address the requirements of our customers. We provide integrated program management services, integrating all on-board cabin interior equipment and systems, including installation and FAA certification, allowing airlines to substantially reduce costs. We believe that we are the only supplier in the commercial aircraft cabin interior products industry with the size, resources, expertise, breadth of product line and global product support capability to operate in this manner. 
     Our integrated program management approach assigns a program management team to each significant contract. The program management team leader is responsible for all aspects of the specific contract and profitability, including managing change orders, negotiating related upfront engineering charges and monitoring the progress of the contract through its delivery dates. We believe that our customers benefit substantially from our program management approach, including better on-time delivery and higher service levels. We also believe our program management approach results in higher customer satisfaction. 
     We market our business jet products directly to all of the world's general aviation airframe manufacturers, completion centers and operators. Business jet owners typically rely upon the airframe manufacturers and completion centers to coordinate the procurement and installation of their interiors. Business jet owners select manufacturers of business jet products on a basis similar to commercial aircraft interior products: custom design capabilities, product quality and performance, on-time delivery, after-sales customer service, product support and price. Barriers to entry include regulatory requirements, our large installed product base, our custom design capability, manufacturing capability, delivery, after-sales customer service, product support and our broad product line. 
     As of December 31, 2016, our direct sales, marketing and product support organizations consisted of 462 employees. In addition, we currently retain 54 independent sales representatives. Our sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $1.8 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which represents approximately 61%, 65% and 67% of revenues, respectively. Approximately 58% of our total revenues were derived from airlines, aircraft leasing companies, maintenance, repair and overhaul providers, and other commercial aircraft operators during each of the three years ended December 31, 2016. During fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately 36%, 40% and 40%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from the aftermarket.

 We believe that our large installed base, our timely responsiveness in connection with custom design, manufacture, delivery and after-sales customer service and product support, our broad product line and stringent customer and regulatory requirements, all present barriers to entry for potential new competitors in the aircraft cabin interior products market. Our principal competitors for our commercial aircraft segment are Groupe Zodiac Aerospace S.A., Thompson Aero Seating Ltd., Recaro Aircraft Seating GmbH & Co. KG, Diehl Aerosystems Holding GmBH and Jamco America, Inc. The market for business jet products is highly fragmented, consisting of numerous competitors including a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation.
     Backlog
     Our booked backlog at December 31, 2016 was $3.5 billion, as compared with booked backlog of $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2014. The charts below reflect information related to booked backlog by geographic region and the expected roll-out of booked backlog. 
    
     We record backlog when we enter into a definitive order for the delivery of products to our customers in the future. Within backlog, we differentiate between booked backlog and awarded but unbooked backlog. For manufacturing programs, generally if there are definitive delivery dates then the backlog is considered booked. When we receive the delivery date specificity in writing from our customers on these long-term contracts, we include such amount in booked backlog. If a contract does not provide that level of specificity, the production requirements are generally provided to us through purchase orders issued against the underlying contracts at which point the amount of the purchase orders is classified as booked. The remaining portion of the underlying contract is considered awarded but unbooked. 
     As of December 31, 2016, we had a record booked backlog of $3.5 billion. While the expected delivery dates of our backlog varies from year to year, generally about 50% of the backlog is deliverable in the following 12 months, with the balance generally deliverable over approximately the next two years. As an example, we believe approximately 50% of our December 31, 2016 booked backlog will be delivered during 2017. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 78% of booked backlog is related to CAS and 22% is related to BJS. The quality of our backlog has continued to improve as a result of partnering with key long-term customers, outstanding engineering, global sourcing and program management capabilities resulting in superior products which we believe are the most innovative cabin interior products solutions for our customers. While we do operate in a cyclical industry, program cancellations are the exception, not the norm; historically, backlog cancellations have not been significant due to the fact that airlines seek fleet commonality once they begin to outfit their fleets with a particular cabin interior product or configuration. This is important to an airline due to customer expectations for a consistent level of service, particularly on international routes as well as complexities that arise from maintaining multiple layouts and products with spare parts on a global basis, and other similar considerations. As a result, these programs tend to be deferred to later periods, rather than being cancelled. As an example in 2008 following the global credit crisis, our airline customers experienced a significant contraction in demand, which resulted in the deferral of a number of programs from delivery in the 2008-2009 period to 2009-2011. Despite the negative impacts on our customers from this severe global recession, no significant retrofit programs were cancelled. For a more detailed discussion on 

 
  14

 
risks associated with our backlog, see Item 1A. Risk Factors – We have a significant backlog that may be deferred or may not be entirely realized. 
     Program awards will be added to booked backlog when we receive purchase orders or otherwise are provided with specificity regarding delivery dates. At December 31, 2016, we estimate the value of these unbooked program awards at $5.6 billion.
     Total backlog, both booked and awarded but unbooked, expanded to a record $9.1 billion, an increase of 3.4% from December 31, 2015.
     Customer Service 
     We believe that our customers place a high value on customer service and product support and that this service level is a critical differentiating factor in our industry. The key elements of such service include: 
· | Rapid response to requests for engineering, design, proposals and technical specifications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Flexibility with respect to customized features;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | On-time delivery;
--+------------------


· | Immediate availability of spare parts for a broad range of products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Prompt attention to customer problems, including on-site customer training.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Customer service is particularly important to the airlines due to the high costs associated with late delivery, malfunctions and other problems. 
     Warranty and Product Liability 
     We warrant our products, or specific components thereof, for periods ranging from one to ten years, depending on product and component type. We establish reserves for product warranty expense after considering relevant factors such as our stated warranty policies and practices, historical frequencies of claims to replace or repair products under warranty and recent sales and claims trends. Actual warranty costs reduce the warranty reserve as they are incurred. We periodically review the adequacy of accrued product warranty reserves and revisions of such reserves are recognized in the period in which such revisions are determined. 
     We also carry product liability insurance. We believe that our insurance is sufficient to cover product liability claims. 
     Manufacturing and Raw Materials 
     Our manufacturing operations consist of both the in-house manufacturing of component parts and sub-assemblies and the assembly of our designed component parts that are purchased from outside vendors. We maintain up-to-date facilities, and we have an ongoing strategic manufacturing improvement plan utilizing lean manufacturing processes. We constantly strive for continuous improvement from implementation of these plans for each of our product lines. We have implemented common information technology platforms company-wide, as appropriate. These activities should lower our production costs, shorten cycle times and reduce inventory requirements and at the same time improve product quality, customer response and profitability. We do not believe we are materially dependent on any single supplier or assembler for any of our raw materials or specified and designed component parts and, based upon the existing arrangements with vendors, our current and anticipated requirements and market conditions, we believe that we have made adequate provisions for acquiring raw materials.

     Government Regulation 
     The FAA prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft components, and licenses component repair stations within the United States. Comparable agencies regulate such matters in other countries. We hold several FAA component certificates and perform component repairs at a number of our U.S. facilities under FAA repair station licenses. We also hold an approval issued by the EASA to design, manufacture, inspect and test aircraft seating products in Leighton Buzzard, United Kingdom and to manufacture and ship from our Kilkeel, Northern Ireland facility. We also have the necessary approvals to design, manufacture, inspect, test and repair our interior systems products in Nieuwegein, the Netherlands. Additionally we hold EASA/LBA (Luftfahrtbundesamt, the National German Aviation Authority) approval to manufacture, inspect, test and repair our commercial life support systems equipment and the approval of the German Federal Office of Defense and Procurement (BWB) to design, manufacture and repair military aviation equipment in Lübeck, Germany.
     Our Structures and Integration Group in Everett, Washington holds an Organization Designation Authorization (“ODA”) from the FAA that includes delegated authority to issue Supplemental Type Certificates (“STC”) and produce parts under a FAA Production Certificate (“PC”). Our ODA STC allows us to reconfigure the interior of airplanes, install crew rests, install satellite communications and perform passenger-to-freighter conversions on all major transport category aircraft types. Under our ODA STC we can approve the design of an aircraft modification and the parts that go into it, and issue the STC in support of the return to service of the modified airplane. This authorization allows us to install new and prototype parts on the aircraft and upon STC issuance add these parts to our PC and designate them as airworthy approved production parts.
     Environmental Matters 
     Our operations are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and foreign laws and regulations establishing health and environmental quality standards, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water and the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. We may be subject to liabilities or penalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations, such as the Federal Superfund Law and similar state statutes, governing remediation of contamination at facilities that we currently or formerly owned or operated or to which we send hazardous substances or waste for treatment, recycling or disposal. We believe that we are currently compliant, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, we could become subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability relating to our facilities or operations.      Patents and Other Intellectual Property 
     We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the United States, similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products we sell and otherwise use in our operations. We currently hold 477 U.S. patents and 831 foreign patents, as well as 209 U.S. patent applications and 679 foreign patent applications covering a variety of products. We do not believe that we are dependent on one or a group of patents, and as such we believe the termination, expiration or infringement of one or more of such patents would not have a material adverse effect on us.      Employees 
     As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 10,875 employees. Approximately 68% of our employees are engaged in manufacturing/distribution operations, quality and purchasing, 21% in engineering, research and development and program management, 4% in sales, marketing and product support and 7% in finance, human resources, information technology, legal and general administration. Unions represent 

 
  16

 
approximately 12% of our worldwide employees. One domestic labor contract, representing approximately 5% of our employees, expires in May 2018. The labor contract with the only other domestic union, which represents 1% of our employees, expires in October 2017. The remaining portions of our unionized employees are located in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, which tend to have government mandated union organizations. We consider our employee relations to be good and we have not experienced a business disruption due to labor relations.
