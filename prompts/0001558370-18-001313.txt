 Overview
 We are a clinical‑stage gene therapy company dedicated to developing and commercializing novel treatments for patients suffering from rare and life‑threatening neurological genetic diseases. Our initial product candidate, AVXS‑101, is our proprietary gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA. SMA is a severe neuromuscular disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons, leading to progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. The incidence of SMA is approximately one in 10,000 live births. SMA is generally divided into sub‑categories termed SMA Type 1, 2, 3 and 4. We are conducting a pivotal clinical trial for AVXS‑101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1, the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA Type 1 is a lethal genetic disorder characterized by motor neuron loss and associated muscle deterioration, resulting in mortality or the need for permanent ventilation support before the age of two for greater than 90% of patients. In the incident population, approximately 60% of SMA patients have Type 1. In our recently completed Phase 1 clinical trial of AVXS‑101 in patients with SMA Type 1, we observed a favorable safety profile, and that AVXS-101 was generally well-tolerated. As of August 7, 2017, all patients in the trial survived event-free at 20 months of age, in contrast to the 8% event-free rate at 20 months demonstrated in an independent, peer-reviewed natural history study of patients with SMA Type 1. Additionally, we observed improved motor function and the attainment of motor milestones such as the ability to sit unassisted in the majority of patients, and in some patients, the ability to crawl, stand and walk — motor milestone achievements that are essentially never seen among untreated patients suffering from SMA Type 1. 
 The survival motor neuron protein, or SMN, is a critical protein for normal motor neuron signaling and function.  SMA, and the SMA sub‑types, are diagnosed by identifying the existence of a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene, by determining the number of copies of the SMN2 backup gene, which correlates with disease onset and severity and clinical signs and symptoms of the disease. Patients with SMA Type 1 either have experienced a deletion of their SMN1 genes, which prevents them from producing adequate levels of functional SMN protein, or carry a mutation in their SMN1 gene. AVXS‑101 is designed to deliver a fully functional human SMN gene into the nuclei of target cells, including motor neurons that then generates an increase in SMN protein levels, and we believe this will result in improved motor neuron function and patient outcomes. We believe gene therapy is a therapeutic approach that is well‑suited for the treatment of SMA due to the monogenic nature of the disease, meaning it is caused by mutations in or deletions of a single gene. AVXS‑101 is designed to possess the key elements of an optimal gene therapy approach to SMA, potentially enabling a one‑time dose regimen: delivery of a fully functional human SMN gene into target motor neuron cells; production of sufficient levels of SMN protein required to improve motor neuron function; and rapid onset of effect in addition to sustained SMN gene expression. AVXS‑101 utilizes a non‑integrating adeno‑associated virus, or AAV, capsid to deliver a functional copy of a human SMN gene to the patient’s own cells without modifying the existing DNA of the patient. Unlike many other capsids, the AAV9 capsid utilized in AVXS‑101 crosses the blood‑brain barrier, a tight protective barrier which regulates the passage of substances between the bloodstream and the brain, thus allowing for intravenous administration. In addition, AAV9 has been observed in preclinical studies to efficiently target motor neuron cells when delivered via either intrathecal or intravenous administration. AVXS‑101 has a self‑complementary DNA sequence that enables rapid onset of effect and a continuous promoter that is intended to allow for continuous and sustained SMN gene expression. Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved an alternative-splicing drug for the treatment of SMA in December 2016, we believe that there remains significant unmet medical need and interest in a gene replacement therapy for SMA that can act on the underlying defect in the SMN1 gene and that can provide enhanced survival and motor function benefit via a one‑time dose.
 The FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, have each granted AVXS-101 orphan drug designation for the treatment of SMA, and the FDA has granted AVXS-101 fast track designation for the treatment of SMA Type 1. The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1 in pediatric patients. The FDA established breakthrough therapy designation to facilitate dialogue between the FDA and the sponsor to provide advice on generating evidence needed to support approval of the therapy in an efficient manner with more intensive and interactive guidance on an efficient drug development program, an organizational commitment involving the FDA’s senior managers, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. We intend to request a pre-

Biologics License Application, or BLA, meeting for AVXS-101 in SMA with the FDA in the second quarter of 2018. The EMA granted access into its PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, program for AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1. PRIME is intended to enhance support for the development of medicines—specifically those that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments or benefit patients without treatment options—through early and proactive support by EMA to optimize the generation of robust data and development plans, and potentially expedite the assessment of the marketing authorization application so these medicines may reach patients sooner. In addition, we intend to seek EMA Pre-Submission Scientific Advice in the first half of 2018 to determine if the data from our Phase 1 study of AVXS‑101 may meet the evidentiary requirements for the conditional approval pathway in the European Union. 
 We are also currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA Type 2. SMA Type 2 typically presents between six and 18 months of age, and those affected will never walk without support and most will never stand without support. SMA Type 2 results in mortality in more than 30% of patients by the age of 25. In addition to our ongoing clinical trials, we intend to expand our clinical development program of AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA by initiating three additional clinical trials to further evaluate AVXS-101, including in new patient populations.  First, we intend to initiate a pivotal trial of AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1 in Europe during the first half of 2018.  Second, we intend to initiate a trial for pre-symptomatic SMA patients with two, three and four copies of the SMN2 backup gene, who are less than six weeks of age at the time of gene therapy, to evaluate appropriate clinical endpoints of a one-time intravenous, or IV, dose of AVXS-101 in the first half of 2018. Finally, we intend to initiate a pediatric "all comers" trial for approximately 50 patients between approximately six months and 18 years of age who do not qualify for other AVXS-101 trials at the time of gene therapy, to evaluate a one-time intrathecal, or IT, dose of AVXS-101 in the late fourth quarter of 2018 or early 2019. 
 We have an exclusive, worldwide license with Nationwide Children’s Hospital, or NCH, under certain patent applications related to both the intravenous and intrathecal delivery of AVXS‑101 for the treatment of all types of SMA, and an exclusive, worldwide license, with rights to sublicense, from REGENXBIO Inc., or REGENXBIO, to any recombinant AAV vector in REGENXBIO’s intellectual property portfolio for the in vivo gene therapy treatment of SMA in humans. In addition, we have a non‑exclusive, worldwide license agreement with Asklepios BioPharmaceutical Inc., or AskBio, under certain patents and patent applications owned by the University of North Carolina and licensed to AskBio for the use of its self‑complementary DNA technology for the treatment of SMA.
 In 2013, in connection with the exclusive license agreement with NCH, we formed a collaboration with NCH to explore the use of gene therapy for the treatment of SMA and secured our first institutional investors and expanded our leadership team. Our current operations are a result of this collaboration with NCH and research conducted by our Chief Scientific Officer, Brian Kaspar, Ph.D. Dr. Kaspar has over 20 years of gene therapy experience, and until September 2016 served as a principal investigator in the Center for Gene Therapy at The Research Institute at NCH. NCH is a leading pediatric gene therapy research institute.
 In addition to developing AVXS-101 to treat SMA, we plan to develop other novel treatments for two additional rare neurological monogenetic diseases, Rett syndrome and a genetic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 gene, or genetic ALS.
 To execute on our mission, we have assembled a management team that includes individuals with expertise in gene therapy, regulatory development, product and clinical development, manufacturing, medical affairs and commercialization, with a history of success in building and operating innovative biotechnology and healthcare companies focused on rare and life‑threatening diseases. This team is led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Sean P. Nolan, who brings over 26 years of broad leadership and management experience in the biopharmaceutical industry to AveXis. Prior to AveXis, Mr. Nolan was the chief business officer of InterMune, Inc. where he led multiple functions across the organization, including North American commercial operations, global marketing, corporate and business development, and global manufacturing and supply chain. Our other management team members also have successful track records developing and commercializing drugs through previous experiences at companies such as Abbott Laboratories, Amgen, Centocor, InterMune, Hospira, MedImmune, Novartis, Pfizer, Daiichi Sankyo and Quest Diagnostics.

 Our Strategy
 We are building a patient‑centric business with the goal of developing innovative gene therapy treatments that transform the lives of patients and their families suffering from rare and life‑threatening neurological genetic diseases. In order to accomplish this goal, we plan to execute on the following key strategies:
· | Rapidly advance our SMA Type 1 program through clinical trials in the United States. We are conducting a pivotal trial of AVXS-101 in SMA Type 1 using the IV formulation produced by our good manufacturing practice, or GMP, commercial manufacturing process. Five patients have been dosed in this clinical trial to date. In January 2017, we announced the completion of our Phase 1 clinical trial of AVXS‑101 in patients with SMA Type 1, in which we observed a favorable safety profile and that AVXS-101 was generally well-tolerated. As of August 7, 2017, all patients in the trial survived event-free at 20 months of age, in contrast to the 8% event-free rate at 20 months demonstrated in an independent, peer-reviewed natural history study of patients with SMA Type 1. The FDA has granted AVXS‑101 orphan drug designation for the treatment of all types of SMA, fast track designation for the treatment of SMA Type 1 and breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of SMA Type 1 in pediatric patients. We intend to request a pre-BLA meeting for AVXS-101 for SMA Type 1 with the FDA in the second quarter of 2018.

· | Further expand the development of AVXS‑101 for the treatment of SMA. Based on preclinical data and our preliminary clinical observations to date, we believe AVXS‑101 may also have the ability to treat patients with SMA Types 2, 3 and 4, which result from the same genetic defect as SMA Type 1. We are conducting a Phase 1 safety and dosing escalation study of AVXS‑101 via IT delivery in patients with SMA Type 2. Two patients have been dosed in this clinical trial to date. Furthermore, we intend to initiate a trial for patients with two, three and four copies of the SMN2 backup gene, who are less than six weeks of age and pre-symptomatic at the time of gene therapy, to evaluate appropriate clinical endpoints of a one-time IV dose of AVXS-101 in the first half of 2018. We also intend to initiate a pediatric "all comers" trial for approximately 50 patients between approximately six months and 18 years of age who do not qualify for other AVXS-101 trials at the time of gene therapy, to evaluate a one-time IT dose of AVXS-101 in the late fourth quarter of 2018 or early 2019.

· | Advance the development of AVXS‑101 outside of the United States. The incidence, standard of care and prognosis of SMA globally are generally consistent. Despite a treatment being approved in Europe during 2017, we believe there is significant unmet need for patients suffering from SMA outside the United States. In January 2017, we announced that the EMA granted AVXS‑101 access into its PRIME program for the treatment of SMA Type 1. We intend to initiate our European pivotal trial of AVXS‑101 for SMA Type 1 during the first half of 2018. In February 2017, we announced that this pivotal trial will reflect a single‑arm design, using natural history of the disease as a comparator, and will enroll approximately 30 patients with SMA Type 1 who are less than six months of age at the time of gene therapy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Build a pipeline of gene therapy treatments for other rare and life‑threatening neurological genetic diseases, including Rett syndrome and genetic ALS. In addition to our programs in SMA, we also intend to identify, acquire, develop and commercialize novel product candidates for the treatment of other rare and life‑threatening neurological genetic diseases that we believe can be treated with gene therapy. We intend to employ a targeted approach to acquisition and licensing transactions reflecting our goal to be a leading gene therapy company focused on the treatment of rare and life‑threatening neurological diseases. In June 2017, we announced that we had entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with REGENXBIO for the development and commercialization of gene therapy using the recombinant AAV9 vector to treat Rett syndrome and genetic ALS. We expect to move forward with initiating investigational new drug application, or IND, enabling studies in both Rett syndrome and genetic ALS and submit IND applications for both indications in late 2018 or early 2019.

cGMP‑compliant manufacturing facility. Based on data from our intended current cGMP development work and feedback from ongoing discussions with the FDA, including our chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, meeting with the FDA in May 2017, we made the strategic decision to use our intended cGMP derived product in all current and future studies of AVXS‑101 and for all commercial needs if AVXS-101 receives marketing approval. We are executing on our manufacturing plan to ensure there is sufficient supply to meet our needs for both clinical material and for commercial demand, if AVXS-101 is approved by the FDA. We will continue to evaluate our internal manufacturing capabilities and engage third-party manufacturers, if needed, to support production and provide alternate supply for both AVXS-101 and for our other programs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Invest in developing and accessing intellectual property to further expand our product portfolio. To date, we have secured our intellectual property position through our agreements with our key collaborators and other third parties. We plan to build upon this intellectual property position through additional patent applications related to AVXS‑101. With respect to future product candidates, we expect to continue to work with REGENXBIO and other creators of next generation vectors to ensure appropriate access to additional therapeutic candidates. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to develop a strong, collaborative network of key stakeholders, including patient advocacy groups, healthcare professionals, key opinion leaders and research institutions, to inform our clinical development and commercialization strategies. We believe that it is imperative to put the patient at the center of our focus, and we intend to continue to work and listen closely to key stakeholders to ensure that we clearly understand their issues, insights and recommendations. The feedback from and collaboration with these groups have and will continue to inform our key strategies to transform the lives of patients and their families suffering from rare and life‑threatening neurological genetic diseases with safe and effective therapies. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Build organizational capabilities to establish commercial readiness to market AVXS-101 once regulatory approval is received. We are in the process of building a commercial infrastructure capable of launching AVXS-101 in the United States. This involves understanding the market, determining strategies to make the therapy accessible to physicians and patients once approved, and hiring the necessary personnel.

  Background on Gene Therapy
 Many diseases are driven by genetic mutations in which the mutated genes can affect the production of proteins. Gene therapy attempts to address disease biology by introducing recombinant DNA into a patient’s own cells, commonly in the form of a functional copy of the patient’s defective gene, to address the genetic defect and modulate protein production and cellular function, which provides therapeutic benefit.
 Using gene therapy, physicians can introduce or re‑introduce genes that encode for a therapeutic protein. Instead of providing proteins or other therapies externally and dosing them over a long period, we believe gene therapy offers the possibility of dosing a patient once to achieve a long‑term, durable benefit. Gene therapies are typically comprised of three elements: a transgene, a promoter and a delivery mechanism such as our AAV9 capsid. Once the therapeutic gene is transferred to a patient’s cells, we believe the cells may be able to continue to produce the therapeutic protein for years or, potentially, the rest of the patient’s life. As a result, gene therapy has the potential to transform the way these patients are treated by addressing the underlying genetic defect.
 Background on Spinal Muscular Atrophy
 SMA is a severe neuromuscular disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons leading to progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. The incidence of SMA is approximately one in 10,000 live births, and one in 50 people are carriers of the SMA gene (approximately six million Americans). SMA is generally divided into sub‑categories termed SMA Type 1, 2, 3 and 4. SMA, and the SMA sub‑types, the genetic diagnosis is made by first identifying the existence of a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene and then determining the number of copies of the SMN2 backup gene, which correlates with disease onset and severity. If insufficient protein is expressed, muscles do not develop properly.

Patients that have SMA Type 1, the most severe type of SMA, have an onset of symptoms within six months of birth, have difficulty breathing and swallowing and will never develop the strength or muscle control to sit up independently or the ability to crawl or walk. SMA Type 1 patients frequently die in early childhood due to complications related to respiratory failure resulting from motor neuron degeneration. Although SMA Types 2, 3 and 4 are generally less severe than SMA Type 1, they still present patients with significant medical challenges. The standard of care for patients with SMA Type 1 has traditionally been limited to palliative therapies, including life‑long respiratory care, ventilator support, nutritional care, orthopedic care and physical therapy. In December 2016, the FDA approved SPINRAZATM (nusinersen), developed by Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., for the treatment of SMA. Nusinersen employs an approach for the treatment of SMA called alternative splicing, which seeks to achieve more efficient production of full‑length SMN protein from the SMN2 gene. However, we believe that there is significant interest in a gene replacement therapy for SMA that can act on the underlying defect in the primary gene (SMN1) and can provide enhanced survival and motor function benefit via a one‑time dose.
 SMA is caused by a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene that codes SMN, a protein necessary for survival of motor neurons. Although individuals typically receive one copy of the SMN1 gene from each parent, only one properly functioning SMN1 gene is required to generate adequate levels of full‑length SMN protein. SMA results from the patient’s lack of a properly functioning SMN1 gene, either due to mutation or loss of the gene. SMA is a recessive trait, meaning that while both parents of an SMA patient may be healthy, they each carry and pass along to their child DNA that contains either a mutated or missing SMN1 gene which results in the disease manifesting itself in the child.
 Human DNA contains a backup to the SMN1 gene, the SMN2 gene. Individuals may carry multiple copies of the SMN2 backup gene within their DNA. However, approximately 90% of SMN protein produced by the SMN2 backup gene is non‑functional, truncated SMN protein missing a polypeptide segment (coded for by exon 7) that is essential to form a functional SMN molecule. The level of functional full‑length SMN protein produced by an SMA patient’s SMN2 genes is generally insufficient to prevent loss of proper motor neuron function. As the SMN2 genes are capable of producing minimal levels of full‑length SMN protein, the number of copies of the SMN2 backup gene serves as a disease modifier, such that the more copies of the SMN2 backup gene there are, the less severe the disease. The following diagram presents the difference between a healthy person and someone afflicted by SMA.

 SMA is typically diagnosed based on the onset of clinical symptoms along with a genetic assessment of the absence of SMN1 and the number of copies of SMN2. However, a genetic diagnosis can also be made prenatally either through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.
 The following table describes the general disease onset, incidence rates, survival and general characteristics for each of the different types of SMA. 

 | | | Incidence per | | 
 | Number of | | Live Birth | | 
 | Copies | | among SMA | | 
SMA Type | of SMN2 | Onset | Types | Survival | Characteristics 
Type 1 (Werdnig-Hoffman Disease) | Two | Before six months | Approximately 60% | Less than 10% event free* by two years of age | Will never be able to sit without support 
Type 2 (Dubowitz Syndrome) | Three or Four | 6 - 18 months | Approximately 27% | 68% alive at age 25 | Will never be able to walk or stand without support 
Type 3 (Lugelberg-Welander Disease) | Three or Four | Early childhood to early adulthood (juvenile) | Approximately 13% | Normal | Stand alone and walk but may lose ability to walk in 30s - 40s
Type 4 | Four to Eight | Adulthood (20s - 30s) usually after 30 | Uncommon: limited incidence information available | Normal | Same as Type 3

* | An event is defined as death or at least 16 hours per day of required ventilation support for breathing for 14 consecutive days in the absence of acute reversible illness or perioperatively.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  SMA Type 1
 SMA Type 1 is a lethal genetic disorder characterized by motor neuron loss and associated muscle deterioration, resulting in mortality or the need for permanent ventilation support before the age of two for greater than 90% of patients. SMA Type 1 is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA Type 1 accounts for approximately 60% of all new SMA cases. Symptoms of SMA Type 1 include:

· | hypotonia, which is also known as “floppy baby syndrome” and is characterized by abnormal limpness in the neck and limbs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | muscle weakness, particularly in the legs;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | poor head control;
--+-------------------


· | abdominal breathing, also known as diaphragmatic or belly breathing, which is characterized by breathing through the contracting of the diaphragm rather than the chest;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | bulbar muscle weakness, which is exhibited by a weak cry, difficulty swallowing and aspiration; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the inability to sit unsupported.
--+----------------------------------

  In an independent, peer‑reviewed natural history study published by the American Academy of Neurology on SMA Type 1 in 2014, or the Finkel 2014 Study, the authors observed that the life expectancy of a child with SMA Type 1 is, for a majority of patients, less than two years. The following chart presents the percentage of children with SMA Type 1 that die or require at least 16 hours per day of ventilation support for breathing at varying ages for 14 consecutive days in the absence of acute reversible illness or perioperatively, as observed in the Finkel 2014 Study, along with major developmental milestones for a healthy baby. Another published multi‑center government funded study, or the NeuroNEXT Study, which examined the longitudinal, natural history of SMA Type 1, reconfirmed the findings from the Finkel 2014 Study on the life expectancy and developmental milestones for a child with SMA Type 1.

 Existing Treatments for SMA
 The standard of care for patients with SMA Type 1 has traditionally been limited to palliative therapies, including life‑long respiratory care, ventilator support, nutritional care, orthopedic care and physical therapy. In December 2016, the FDA approved SPINRAZATM (nusinersen), developed by Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., for the treatment of SMA. Nusinersen employs an approach for the treatment of SMA called alternative splicing, which seeks to achieve more efficient production of full‑length SMN protein from the SMN2 gene. However, we believe that there is significant interest in a gene replacement therapy that can act on the underlying defect in the primary gene (SMN1) and can provide enhanced survival and motor function benefit via a one‑time dose. 
 Our Product Candidate: AVXS‑101 for the Treatment of SMA
 AVXS‑101 is our proprietary gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of SMA. Because SMA is a neurodegenerative disease, reduced levels of SMN protein lead to continued degeneration. The goal of AVXS‑101 is to give patients a one‑time treatment to restore the body’s production of SMN protein to prevent further degeneration. Based on observations of our Phase 1 clinical trial, we believe that AVXS‑101 also enables increased motor function and enhances survival. AVXS‑101 contains the four elements that we believe are necessary for optimal delivery and function.
 Components of AVXS‑101


· | A recombinant AAV9 capsid shell: a non‑integrating adeno‑associated virus capsid to deliver a functional copy of a human SMN gene to the patient’s own cells without modifying the existing DNA of the patient. Unlike many other capsids, the AAV9 capsid utilized in AVXS‑101 crosses the blood‑brain barrier, a tight protective barrier which regulates the passage of substances between the bloodstream and the brain, and into the spinal cord, thus allowing the option for intravenous administration. In addition, AAV9 has been observed in preclinical studies to efficiently target motor neuron cells when delivered via either intrathecal or intravenous administration. In AVXS‑101, the DNA contained within the capsid shell is engineered to contain the other three critical elements of AVXS‑101, with the removal of the viral DNA, which leads to a significant reduction in pathogenicity and ability to replicate. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A human SMN transgene: a stable, functioning SMN gene that is introduced into the cell’s nucleus. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Self‑complementary DNA technology: the human SMN transgene is introduced as a self‑complementary double‑stranded molecule. The inclusion of this technology enables rapid onset of effect. Typically, a single‑stranded AAV vector must wait for cell‑mediated synthesis of its complementary DNA strand to form the double‑stranded DNA unit that is required for DNA replication and subsequent protein synthesis. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The self‑complementary modification overcomes this rate‑limiting step of cell‑mediated second‑strand synthesis, as the two complementary halves of the scAAV genomes will associate with each other to form the required double‑stranded DNA unit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A continuous promoter: this agent activates the transgene and is designed to allow for continuous and sustained SMN gene expression. The cytomegalovirus enhanced chicken beta‑actin hybrid promoter that we utilize is a constitutive, or “always on” promoter that has been observed to increase transgene expression from AAV vectors compared to other promoters.

  Clinical Development of AVXS‑101 
 We are currently developing AVXS‑101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1 through intravenous administration and SMA Type 2 for intrathecal administration. We intend to initiate three additional studies to further evaluate AVXS-101, including in new SMA patient populations. Pivotal Clinical Trial for SMA Type 1
 In September 2017, based on the FDA's review of our clinical, non-clinical and chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, data, including a potency assay of AVXS-101, we initiated our pivotal trial of AVXS-101 for patients with SMA Type 1 using the IV formulation produced using our current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, commercial manufacturing process. Five patients have been dosed in this clinical trial to date. 
           The open-label, single-arm, single-dose, multi-center trial, which we call STR1VE, is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a one-time IV infusion of AVXS-101 of 1.1 × 1014 vg/kg, which is intended to be equivalent to the proposed therapeutic dose received by the second dosing cohort in our Phase 1 clinical trial of AVXS-101 in patients with SMA Type 1.
           The trial will enroll a minimum of 15 patients with SMA Type 1 who are less than six months of age at the time of gene therapy, and who have one or two copies of the SMN2 backup gene as determined by genetic testing and bi-allelic SMN1 gene deletion or point mutations. Following dosing of the first three patients in the trial, we conducted a review of the safety data of AVXS-101 from six time points (days one, two, seven, 14, 21 and 30), as well as early signals of efficacy.  Based on our review and discussion with the FDA, we have initiated screening for, and begun enrolling, the remaining patients in the trial in accordance with the trial protocol.
           The intent-to-treat, or ITT, population is defined as patients who are less than six months of age and symptomatic at the time of gene therapy, with two copies of the SMN2 gene as determined by genetic testing, bi-allelic SMN1 gene deletion and no c.859G>C mutation in SMN2. The intended enrollment will include at least 15 patients that meet the ITT criteria. The first three patients will be ITT patients per the trial protocol definition and will be dosed four weeks apart to assess safety and efficacy using the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders, or CHOP INTEND.
           The co-primary efficacy outcome measures of the trial will include:

· | The achievement of the developmental milestone of independent sitting for at least 30 seconds at 18 months of age; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Event-free survival at 14 months of age, with an event defined as either death or at least 16 hours per day of required ventilation support for breathing for 14 consecutive days in the absence of acute reversible illness or perioperatively.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  8

 

           Co-secondary outcome measures will include:

· | The ability to thrive, defined as the ability to remain independent from feeding support, tolerate thin liquids and maintain weight; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The ability to remain independent of ventilatory support at 18 months of age.

      The trial is projected to be conducted at 16 sites in the United States, including: Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Boston Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital Colorado, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Columbia University, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Duke University, Johns Hopkins Pediatric Neurology, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Oregon Health and Science University, Stanford University Medical Center, University of Central Florida College of Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, University of Utah, University of Wisconsin, and Washington University School of Medicine.
 Phase 1 Clinical Trial for SMA Type 2
 The open-label, dose-comparison, multi-center Phase 1 trial, which we call STRONG, is designed to evaluate the safety, optimal dosing and proof of concept for efficacy of AVXS-101 in two distinct age groups of patients with SMA Type 2, utilizing a one-time IT route of administration. The trial will enroll 27 infants and children who are symptomatic with a genetic diagnosis consistent with SMA, including the bi-allelic deletion of SMN1 and three copies of SMN2 without the SMN2 genetic modifier, who are able to sit but have no historical or current ability to stand or walk. Two patients in this clinical trial have been dosed to date.
           Two dosage strengths will be evaluated and patients will be stratified into two age groups: patients less than 24 months and patients at least 24 months but less than 60 months. There will be at least a four-week interval between the dosing of the first three patients for each dose being studied and, based on the available safety data, a decision will be made whether to proceed. 
 • Patients in Cohort 1 will receive a dose of 6.0 × 1013 vg of AVXS-101, or Dose A. Cohort 1 will consist of three patients who are less than 24 months of age. • If safety is established according to the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or the DSMB, the trial will proceed to Cohort 2. 
 • Patients in Cohort 2 will receive a dose of 1.2 X 1014 vg of AVXS-101, or Dose B. Cohort 2 will consist of three patients who are less than 60 months of age. • If safety is established according to the DSMB, an additional 21 patients will be enrolled until the trial includes a total of (i) 12 patients less than 24 months of age and (ii) 12 patients at least 24 months, but less than 60 months, of age who have received Dose B.
           According to the well-characterized natural history of the disease by the Pediatric Neuromuscular Clinical Research Network, 100 percent of children with SMA Type 2 will never walk without support, 95 percent of children will never stand without assistance and more than 30 percent will die by 25 years of age. Additionally, children with SMA Type 2, who are between 24 and 60 months of age with 3 copies of the SMN2 gene, experienced a mean decrease of 0.33 points on the Hammersmith Function Motor Scale Expanded over a 12-month period at first evaluation.
 Outcome Measures for Patients Less than 24 Months of Age
 • The primary outcome measure for patients less than 24 months of age at the time of dosing is the achievement of the ability to stand without support for at least three seconds. 
 • The secondary outcome measure is the proportion of patients who achieve the ability to walk without assistance, defined as taking at least five steps independently while displaying coordination and balance. 
 • Developmental abilities, including motor function, will be evaluated as exploratory objectives.

 Outcome Measures for Patients Between 24 and 60 Months of Age
 • The primary outcome measure for patients between 24 months and 60 months of age at the time of dosing is the achievement of change in Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded from baseline. 
 • The secondary outcome measure is the proportion of patients who achieve the ability to walk without assistance, defined as taking at least five steps independently displaying coordination and balance. 
 • Developmental abilities, including motor function, will be evaluated as exploratory objectives.
           The trial is projected to be conducted at 11 sites in the United States, including Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Boston Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Johns Hopkins Pediatric Neurology, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Stanford University Medical Center, University of Central Florida College of Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, University of Utah and Washington University School of Medicine.
 Planned Pivotal Trial of AVXS-101 in SMA Type 1 in Europe
 We intend to initiate a pivotal trial of AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1 in Europe in the first half of 2018.  The planned trial design, which incorporates scientific advice from the EMA, is expected to reflect a single-arm design, using natural history of the disease as a comparator, and is expected to enroll approximately 30 patients with SMA Type 1 who are less than six months of age at the time of gene therapy. The trial is designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of a one-time IV dose of AVXS-101, including achievement of motor milestones, specifically patients’ ability to sit unassisted, as well as an efficacy measure defined by the time from birth to an “event,” defined as death or requiring at least 16 hours per day of ventilation support for breathing for greater than two weeks in the absence of an acute reversible illness, or perioperatively.  Completed Phase 1 Clinical Trial for SMA Type 1
 In April 2014, an open‑label, dose‑escalation Phase 1 clinical trial of AVXS‑101 in patients with SMA Type 1 was initiated as an investigator‑sponsored trial at NCH under an IND, held by Dr. Jerry Mendell, the principal investigator at NCH. We completed the transfer of the IND to AveXis in November 2015. The trial design allowed for the enrollment of up to 15 patients across a maximum of three dosing cohorts. Key inclusion criteria included the presence of typical clinical symptoms before 6 months of age, SMA Type 1 patients with bi‑allelic SMN1 gene deletions or mutations (all patients in the trial had bi‑allelic deletions) and with two copies of the SMN2 backup gene as confirmed by genetic testing in an independent laboratory. Confirmed absence of the Exon 7 genetic modifier (c.859G>C) was made through the laboratory of Dr. Tom Prior, the scientist who described the impact of this mutation on clinical phenotype. Furthermore, all patients were re‑tested at an independent laboratory to re‑confirm all genetic results. Additionally, patients must have been no older than nine months of age (for the first nine patients) and six months of age (for the last six patients) at the time of vector infusion.
 The primary outcome measure of our Phase 1 clinical trial was safety and tolerability. The key efficacy measures were defined as the time from birth to an “event,” which was defined as either death or at least 16 hours per day of required ventilation support for breathing for 14 consecutive days in the absence of acute reversible illness or perioperatively, and video confirmed achievement of ability to sit unassisted. We also assessed several exploratory objective measures in the clinical trial. These exploratory measures were included to assess additional testing protocols on patients in an effort to identify objective testing criteria for measuring the results of the therapy. These exploratory tests included administering a standard motor milestone development survey and CHOP INTEND, the need for pulmonary and feeding support, evaluation of swallowing function, compound motor action potentials testing (CMAP), motor unit number estimation testing (MUNE), non‑invasive electrical impedance myography testing (EIM) and “ability captured through interactive video evaluation‑mini” testing (ACTIVE‑mini).
 Once a patient met the screening criteria for the clinical trial, the patient received a one‑time dose of AVXS‑101, by intravenous injection over a one‑hour period. The patient remained at NCH for 48 hours after dosing for monitoring, and then was discharged. For one month after dosing, weekly follow‑up evaluations were conducted. After 

 
  10

 
the first month, additional monthly evaluations were conducted for the first 12 months followed by quarterly evaluations for the remaining 12 months.
 Clinical Results 
 We fully enrolled our Phase 1 trial, having dosed a total of 15 patients in the trial. The first cohort, which completed dosing in September 2014, consisted of three infants who received a dose of AVXS‑101 administered at the low dose, based on the patient’s weight, or the low-dose cohort. The second cohort, which completed dosing in December 2015, consisted of 12 infants who received the proposed therapeutic dose of AVXS‑101, or the proposed therapeutic dose-cohort.
 As of August 7, 2017, all 15 patients (100%) in the trial reached 20 months of age without experiencing an “event,” described as death or at least 16 hours per day of required ventilation support for breathing for 14 consecutive days in the absence of acute reversible illness or perioperatively, in contrast to the 8% event free rate at this time point demonstrated in an independent, peer-reviewed natural history study for patients with SMA Type 1. All 15 patients experienced improvement from baseline in motor skills measured by their CHOP INTEND scores and such improvement appeared to be dose‑dependent. As of August 7, 2017, we have observed AVXS‑101 to be generally well‑tolerated. 
 As of August 7, 2017, all patients in the proposed therapeutic dose‑cohort were event‑free. The median age at last follow-up was 25.7 months and 30.7 months for patients in the proposed therapeutic-dose cohort and low-dose cohort, respectively.  As previously reported, one patient in the low‑dose cohort, had a pulmonary event in the third quarter of 2016 at the age of 28.8 months. The patient had increased use of bi‑level positive airway pressure, or BiPAP, in advance of surgery related to hypersalivation, a condition experienced by some SMA patients; the event was determined upon independent review to represent progression of disease and not to be related to the use of AVXS‑101. This patient completed the final trial visit in September 2016 and as of that time point, BiPAP use was below the 16 hours per day usage that defines the threshold for the survival endpoint. Although the results of the Finkel 2014 Study were not pre‑specified as a comparator for our trial, we believe that this compilation of data from patients with SMA Type 1 provides a useful context to consider the results of our trial to date. This peer‑reviewed publication reported that 8% of patients with SMA Type 1 were event‑free at 20.0 months of age. The lethality of the disease is further supported by the recent NeuroNEXT Study, which indicated a median time to death or tracheostomy for ventilation support for breathing SMA Type 1 patients from birth of eight months. The following figure shows survival data of all 15 patients enrolled in the clinical trial through August 7, 2017. 

 The CHOP INTEND test is designed to evaluate the motor skills of patients with SMA Type 1 by testing 16 items, which measure the movement of various body segments. As of August 7, 2017, 11 of 12 patients (92%) in the proposed therapeutic dose-cohort have achieved and maintained CHOP INTEND scores of ≥40 points. Two patients who have achieved CHOP INTEND scores of at least 60 points, which is considered to be normal, achieved the 

 
  11

 
maximum CHOP INTEND score of 64. The Finkel 2014 Study reported that patients with SMA Type 1 have an average annual decrease of 1.27 points in their CHOP INTEND score. The NeuroNEXT Study indicated a mean decline of 10.5 points in CHOP INTEND scores over a one-year period in untreated SMA Type 1 patients, highlighting the rapid loss of motor function occurring early in the disease course. All 15 patients enrolled in our Phase 1 trial experienced improvement from baseline in motor skills measured by their CHOP INTEND scores and such improvement appeared to be dose‑dependent. As of August 7, 2017, the patients in cohorts 1 and 2 had increased scores from baseline on the CHOP INTEND scale and maintained these changes during the study. Patients in cohort 2 had mean increases of 9.8 points at 1 month and 15.4 points at 3 months. At the study cutoff on August 7, 2017, patients in cohort 1 had a mean increase of 7.7 points from a mean baseline of 16.3 points, and those in cohort 2 had a mean increase of 24.6 points from a mean baseline of 28.2 points. As of August 7, 2017, 10 out of 15 patients treated had completed their 2-year follow-up after receipt of their AVXS-101 gene therapy. Based on our observations to date, we believe that increases in CHOP INTEND motor assessments appear to be age, baseline CHOP INTEND score and dose‑dependent. We believe that there may be a dose response, based on our observation of CHOP INTEND scores of patients receiving the proposed therapeutic dose as compared to patients receiving the low dose because, as a group, the patients receiving the proposed therapeutic dose appear to be demonstrating a larger average CHOP INTEND score increase.
 Patients with SMA Type 1 entered the trial at different ages, stages of disease progression and levels of motor function that can result in significant variability in baseline CHOP INTEND scores from patient to patient. Additionally, month‑to‑month variability in CHOP INTEND scores can be influenced by factors that are not related to study treatment. Examples of these factors include upper respiratory tract infections and fractured limbs, which may preclude the testing of some elements of the CHOP INTEND assessment. Our observations are consistent with the Finkel 2014 Study in which baseline CHOP INTEND scores also demonstrated significant variability. While the improvements seen with AVXS‑101 in the proposed therapeutic dose cohort have never been observed in the natural history population, we believe observing change in CHOP INTEND scores over time is beneficial.
 The natural history of SMA Type 1 is marked by the inability to achieve or maintain developmental motor milestones. An independent, peer‑reviewed natural history study of developmental milestones in SMA Type 1 published in Neuromuscular Disorders in 2016, or the De Sanctis 2016 Study, reported that prolongation of survival with supportive care does not impact achievement of motor milestones. As observed in the De Sanctis 2016 Study, a child with SMA Type 1 with symptom onset prior to six months of age will not reach any major milestones such as sitting, crawling, standing and walking, and the highest milestone achieved is seen in the infant’s first visit followed by a rapid decline. In contrast, patients in the proposed therapeutic‑dose cohort consistently achieved and maintained key developmental motor milestones. As of August 7, 2017, 11 of 12 patients (92%) in the proposed therapeutic‑dose cohort achieved head control, nine of 12 patients (75%) could rollover and 11 of 12 patients (92%) could sit with assistance. For the end‑of‑study assessment at January 20, 2017 and subsequent assessments, including the August 7, 2017 assessment, we evaluated three validated and well‑established measures of sitting unassisted for periods of increasing duration. At August 7, 2017, 11 of 12 patients (92%) could sit unassisted for at least five seconds, 10 of 12 patients (83%) could sit unassisted for at least 10 seconds and nine of 12 patients (75%) could sit unassisted for 30 seconds or more. Two patients could walk independently and each had achieved earlier and important developmental milestones such as standing with support, standing alone and walking with support. These milestone achievements were assessed and adjudicated by an independent, third‑party reviewer using video evidence. The results of this process are included in the chart below.

 * At baseline, none of the patients in cohort 2 had achieved any of the listed motor milestones except for bringing a hand to the mouth. As of August 7, 2017, the majority of these patients had reached at least one major motor milestone. No patients in cohort 1 are listed, since none attained any motor milestones. NA denotes not available, and NIV noninvasive ventilation. Plus signs indicate achievement of milestone.† Event‑free survival (the primary efficacy outcome) was defined as the age at the last follow‑up at which patients were free of ventilatory support, which was defined as the need for ventilation for at least 16 hours per day for at least 14 consecutive days.‡ According to item 20 on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, rolling over is defined as movement of at least 180 degrees both left and right from a position of lying on the back.§ Sitting unassisted for at least 5 seconds is in accordance with the criteria of item 22 on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development gross motor subtest and surpasses the 3‑second count that is used as a basis for sitting (test item 1) on the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale–Expanded for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). Sitting unassisted for at least 10 seconds is in accordance with the criteria used in the World Health Organization Multicentre Growth Reference Study. Sitting unassisted for at least 30 seconds defines functional independent sitting and is in accordance with the criteria of item 26 on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development gross motor subtest.¶ Nutritional support refers to the placement of either a gastrostomy tube or a nasogastric tube, as determined by the preference of the parents or the primary physician. Once enrolled in the study, all the patients who required nutritional support underwent gastrostomy‑tube placement, and none were removed during the study.‖ Data are from Finkel et al.** Data are from De Sanctis et al.

 The primary outcome measure for our Phase 1 trial of AVXS‑101 was safety. As of August 7, 2017, a total of 56 serious adverse events, or SAEs, were observed in 13 patients. Of these 56 SAEs, there were two treatment‑related SAEs in two patients. There were also three treatment‑related non‑serious adverse events reported in two patients. All five treatment‑related SAEs and AEs were clinically asymptomatic liver function enzyme, or LFE, elevations.
 The treatment‑related SAEs consisted of two patients that experienced elevated LFEs, which were each assessed as a Grade 4 event under the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events on the basis of laboratory values. We observed the first of these treatment‑related SAEs in the first patient dosed with AVXS‑101 in our Phase 1 clinical trial. After the onset of elevated LFEs, this patient was given a prednisolone regimen starting at 2 mg/kg daily and tapering off over time as LFEs returned to normal. After the first patient, we revised our clinical protocol to include pre‑treatment with prednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day starting one day prior to the gene transfer in order to mitigate the T‑cell immune response against AAV9 and the corresponding increase in LFEs. As of August 7, 2017, following this protocol change, out of the remaining 14 patients in our Phase 1 clinical trial, 11 patients had no reported adverse events related to elevations in LFEs, two patients had Grade 1 or 2 elevations in LFEs, and one patient experienced a Grade 4 elevation in LFE on the basis of laboratory values. We observed that this Grade 4 LFE patient had a concomitant viral infection and required additional prednisolone therapy until the LFEs returned to the normal range. We believe that the pretreatment with prednisolone has generally been effective in reducing the incidence and degree of elevated LFEs. As of August 7, 2017, all AEs and SAEs related to elevated LFEs were isolated elevations in serum transaminases, clinically asymptomatic and resolved with prednisolone treatment. There were no elevations in total bilirubin, gamma‑glutamyl transferase or alkaline phosphatase and the conditions that constitute Hy’s law were not met.

 Based on the 15 patients dosed as of August 7, 2017, we observed AVXS‑101 to be generally well‑tolerated. As previously reported, a total of five adverse events, or AEs, in four patients were deemed treatment‑related. Of these, two were SAEs experienced by two patients, and three were non‑serious AEs experienced by two patients. All consisted of clinically asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations and were resolved with prednisolone treatment. There were no clinically significant elevations of gamma‑glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin and, as such, the conditions that constitute Hy’s Law were not met. Other non‑treatment related AEs were expected and were associated with SMA. A cumulative total of 297 AEs (5 treatment‑related AEs and 292 non‑treatment related AEs) were reported as of August 7, 2017, following monitoring and source verification. Of these, 56 were determined to be SAEs and 241 were non‑serious AEs.
 Preclinical Studies
 Preliminary preclinical proof of concept and safety and tolerability studies of the intravenous delivery method were conducted at NCH and in conjunction with the Mannheimer Foundation for non‑human primate studies. In a mouse model of SMA Type 1, it was observed that a single intravenous injection of AVXS‑101 in mice improved body weight and motor functions, while also extending the median lifespan of the treated mice from 14 days to greater than 250 days with 30% of mice surviving over 400 days, compared to untreated mice, in a dose‑responsive manner. In these studies, a minimally effective dosage was determined to be 6.7 × 1013 vg/kg which increased median lifespan to 28 days. Escalating the dosage to 2.0 × 1014 vg/kg increased the median lifespan of the SMA mouse model greater than 250 days. Further increasing the dosage to 3.3 × 1014 vg/kg also resulted in the SMA mouse model to have a median lifespan greater than 250 days. The 2.0 × 1014 vg/kg and 3.3 × 1014 vg/kg dosages appeared to be indistinguishable, with animals showing normal motor function. In a preclinical study of non‑human primates, it was observed that a single intravenous injection of AVXS‑101 led to sustained human SMN transgene expression in the spinal cord as well as in multiple organs and muscles, when evaluated 24 weeks after injection of AVXS‑101. AVXS‑101 has also been studied in multiple safety and tolerability studies in mice and non‑human primates and no evidence of toxicity was observed for up to 24 weeks after injection of AVXS‑101.
 In addition, preliminary preclinical proof of concept (efficacy and safety) studies of the intrathecal delivery method were conducted at NCH. It was observed that in mice with SMA Type 1, a single intrathecal injection of AVXS‑101 at a maximum dosage level of 3.3 × 1013 vg/kg, improved body weight and motor functions, and most notably extended the median lifespan from 18 days to 282 days, with one‑third of the mice surviving past 400 days. In the SMA mouse model, it was observed that a single intrathecal injection of scAAV9 containing a green fluorescent protein targeted between 21% to 41% and 46% to 72% of motor neurons in the spinal cord at the lowest dosage level and the highest dosage level, respectively. In non‑human primates, it was observed that a single intrathecal injection of scAAV9 containing green fluorescent protein at a dose of 1.0 × 1013 vg/kg targeted 29%, 53% and 73% of cervical, thoracic and lumbar motor neurons, respectively. With tilting for ten minutes in the Trendelenburg position, such targeting increased to 55%, 62% and 80% of cervical, thoracic and lumbar motor neurons, respectively. In swine, NCH and collaborators at Ohio State University designed a small hairpin RNA that targeted porcine SMN and left human SMN intact, which reduced expression of porcine SMN. It was observed that the administration of AVXS‑101 resulted in robust production of human SMN protein and significant increases in motor function. When delivered prior to the onset of motor function decline, AVXS‑101 prevented the majority of SMA symptoms, demonstrated by motor function testing as well as electrophysiological evaluation. When delivered at the onset of SMA symptoms, AVXS‑101 halted further progression and there were improvements in motor function as well as electrophysiological evaluation of motor units.
 Future Applications and Opportunities
 Based on preclinical data and the clinical data from our Phase 1 clinical trial for SMA Type 1, we believe AVXS‑101 may also have utility in other types of SMA, which result from the same genetic defect as SMA Type 1 as it addresses the root cause of the disease. In addition to our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for SMA Type 2, we intend to conduct the following additional clinical trials to further evaluate AVXS-101, including in new SMA patient populations: 

 
  14

 


· | Pre-Symptomatic SMA Types 1, 2, 3 (SPRINT): The planned multi-national trial is expected to enroll approximately 44 patients with two, three and four copies of SMN2 who are less than six weeks of age and who are pre-symptomatic at the time of gene therapy. The trial is designed to evaluate appropriate clinical endpoints, including developmental milestones, survival, bulbar function and safety, of a one-time IV infusion of AVXS-101. We expect to initiate the trial in the first half of 2018, and will provide more trial design details at the time of initiation.

· | Pediatric “All Comers” with SMA Types 1, 2, 3 (REACH): The planned multi-national trial is expected to enroll approximately 50 patients between approximately six months and 18 years of age who do not qualify for other AVXS-101 trials at the time of gene therapy. The trial is designed to evaluate a one-time IT dose of AVXS-101. We expect to initiate the trial late in the fourth quarter of 2018 or early 2019, and will provide more trial design details at the time of initiation.

  In addition to our programs in SMA, we also intend to identify, acquire, develop and commercialize novel product candidates for the treatment of other rare and life‑threatening neurological genetic diseases that we believe can be treated with gene therapy. In June 2017, we announced that we had entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with REGENXBIO for the development and commercialization of gene therapy using AAV9 to treat two rare neurological monogenic disorders: Rett syndrome and genetic ALS. We also licensed from NCH preclinical data suggesting promising safety and efficacy of gene therapy treatments for these disorders using AAV9, generated by our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Brian Kaspar.  See “—Our Collaboration and License Agreements—Strategic Collaborators and Relationships—Preclinical Programs for Rett Syndrome and Genetic ALS.” We expect to move forward with initiating IND-enabling studies in both Rett syndrome and genetic ALS and submit IND applications for both indications in late 2018 or early 2019. Current treatments for Rett syndrome and genetic ALS do not target the genetic cause of either disease, leaving what we believe to be a significant unmet need.
 Rett Syndrome
 Rett syndrome is a devastating, rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by slowed growth, loss of normal movement and coordination and loss of communication skills. Rett syndrome is an X-linked dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the gene for methyl-CpG-binding protein 2, or MECP2, which results in problems with the MECP2 protein, which is critical for normal brain development. Rett syndrome is very rare in males, but occurs in approximately one of every 10,000 female births in the United States with an estimated U.S. prevalence of approximately 8,500 based on applying natural history survival rates to historical births. Affected infants usually begin to show signs and symptoms between six and 18 months of age. Current treatments for patients with Rett syndrome offer only symptomatic relief and do not target the genetic cause of the disease.   Our Product Candidate: AVXS-201 for the Treatment of Rett Syndrome
 We are conducting preclinical studies of AVXS-201, our proprietary gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of Rett syndrome. In completed preclinical studies using rodent models, it was observed that gene therapy to introduce re-expression of the MECP2 gene improved survival and improved the behavioral abnormalities associated with the disease model, including motor function.  AVXS-201, like AVXS-101, is composed of a recombinant AAV9 capsid shell, with a human transgene and a continuous promoter specifically designed for optimal MECP2 expression.
 In a preclinical mouse model, we observed that certain doses of AVXS-201, delivered once into the CSF, increased the median lifespan of a Rett syndrome mouse model to over 200 days, compared to 66 days for untreated mice.  In a preclinical study of non-human primates, we observed that weight, blood parameters, and liver enzymes remained normal up to 18 months after a single lumbar intrathecal injection of AVXS-201.  We have observed no evidence of toxicity in wild-type mice treated with AVXS-201, and we observed no indications of tissue damage or disease in non-human primates post-injection. In both the preclinical mouse studies and preclinical non-human primate studies, we observed widespread targeting of AVXS-201 throughout the whole central nervous system after a single injection, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization and western blotting throughout various brain regions.

 We have generated AVXS-201 by leveraging our manufacturing platform and are utilizing a process very similar to AVXS-101.  We have successfully completed engineering lots, along with a cGMP manufacturing run intended for clinical use, and we have also developed key analytical assays suited for AVXS-201. 
 Genetic ALS
 ALS is a progressive, fatal, neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons in the brain and the spinal cord. Symptoms of ALS include progressive weakness and atrophy of muscles controlling voluntary movement, swallowing, speech and breathing, and most commonly develops between 40 and 70 years of age. Genetic forms of ALS comprise five to ten percent of all ALS cases, and approximately twenty percent of genetic ALS cases are caused by mutations in the SOD1 gene, which are toxic to motor neurons.  In 2013, there were 15,908 patients with “definite ALS” in the United States, a prevalence rate of approximately five of every 100,000 persons. Approximately 800 to 1,600 of these cases were due to genetic causes of ALS.   
 Our Product Candidate: AVXS-301 for the Treatment of Genetic ALS
 We are conducting preclinical studies of AVXS-301, our proprietary gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of genetic ALS.  In previous studies in the laboratory of Dr. Kaspar at NCH, we utilized AAV9 carrying a green fluorescent protein reporter to deliver a short hairpin RNA, or shRNA, targeting the mutant human SOD1 transgene. We observed improved disease outcome in two different mouse models of ALS following a one-time administration, even when delivered at the time of disease onset. We also observed that this treatment was safe and well-tolerated in wild-type mice.  Based on these preclinical studies, we developed AVXS-301, which, like AVXS-101, is composed of an AAV9 capsid shell.  In preclinical studies of an AAV9 vector with a SOD1 shRNA expression cassette and a non-coding stuffer sequence instead of GFP, we observed efficient SOD1 downregulation in vitro, and in vivo efficacy in delaying disease onset and progression.  
 We have studied the administration of AVXS-301 both intravenously and directly into the cerebral spinal fluid, or CSF, in mice that overexpress human mutant SOD1.  We observed that both administrations improved rotarod motor performance and hindlimb grip strength.  In our preclinical mouse studies, we observed that a single administration of AVXS-301 directly into the CSF resulted in a greater than 51% increase in survival in the most severe ALS mouse model.  We also conducted preclinical studies in non-human primates, where we observed that a single lumbar intrathecal infusion of AVXS-301 resulted in approximately 90% SOD1 reduction throughout the monkey spinal cord.  Results from other studies in the field suggest that SOD1 may be involved in more than SOD1-linked disease mutations, which we believe may increase the scope of patients that may be treatable with AVXS-301.
 We have developed a manufacturing process for both AVXS-201 and AVXS-301 by leveraging our AVXS-101 manufacturing platform. As such, we are utilizing a manufacturing process very similar to AVXS-101. We have successfully completed engineering lots for both AVXS-201 and AVXS-301. We intend to complete cGMP clinical manufacturing runs for both products in the near future. 
 Manufacturing 
 We have established our own commercial scale cGMP‑compliant manufacturing facility to enhance supply chain control, increase supply capacity for clinical trials and ensure commercial demand is met in the event that AVXS‑101 receives marketing approval. We intend to use our cGMP manufacturing process for all clinical and commercial production of AVXS-101. We manufacture AVXS‑101 using adherent human embryonic kidney, or HEK, 293 cells. HEK293 cells have been used successfully to manufacture numerous other gene therapy candidates that have been tested or are currently being tested in other clinical trials to date. We use a novel and scalable adherent cell culture approach for AAV9 vector production that can more reliably produce product and has greater surface area to potentially increase productivity relative to traditional flat stock approaches.
 Although we anticipate that our manufacturing facility will be the primary production site to meet projected clinical and commercial demand, we will continue to evaluate, and will pursue as needed, potential third parties and/or additional internal sources of redundant manufacturing capacity to provide multiple long‑term supply alternatives to

meet commercial demand in the event that AVXS‑101 receives marketing approval and for our other programs. We continue to utilize our internal process science group and work with third parties in order to evaluate and develop manufacturing process improvements that may increase the productivity and efficiency of our manufacturing process.
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. In particular, the field of gene therapy is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face substantial competition from many different sources, such as large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions.
 At this time, there is one FDA‑approved, and one EMA‑approved, treatment for SMA. There are currently no treatments approved by the FDA for SMA that specifically address the underlying cause of the disease, the genetic defect in the SMN1 gene. The standard of care for patients with SMA Type 1 has been generally limited to palliative therapies, including life‑long respiratory care, ventilator support, nutritional care, orthopedic care and physical therapy; however, in December 2016, an alternative approach for the treatment of SMA called alternative splicing, which seeks to achieve more efficient production of full‑length SMN protein from the SMN2 gene, SPINRAZATM (nusinersen) received FDA approval and was subsequently launched in the United States. In addition, a number of companies are developing drug candidates for SMA. We are aware of other companies exploring gene therapy treatments in preclinical development, including Biogen, Voyager Therapeutics, Inc. and Généthon. In addition to a gene therapy‑based solution, alternative approaches in clinical development for the treatment of SMA include alternative splicing, neuroprotection and muscle enhancer technologies: 

· | Alternative splicing seeks to increase production of full‑length SMN protein from the SMN2 backup gene. Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., together with its licensee Biogen, received FDA approval in December 2016 for SPINRAZA™ (nusinersen) under Priority Review, and EMA approval in April 2017 and European Commission approval in June 2017, for the treatment of SMA in pediatric and adult patients and subsequently launched the product in the United States and Europe. Additionally, Roche Holding Ltd is conducting Phase 2 clinical trials in SMA Types 1, 2 and 3 and Novartis Corporation is conducting Phase 2 clinical trials for SMA Type 1 patients in the EU.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Neuroprotectants seek to mitigate the loss of motor neurons. Trophos SA, which has been acquired by Roche Holding Ltd, has completed its Phase 2 clinical trial of its lead neuroprotectant product candidate, Olesoxime (TRO19622), in patients between the ages of three and 25 with SMA Types 2 and 3.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other approaches seek to improve muscle function and performance in SMA via additional mechanisms. Cytokinetics, in collaboration with Astellas, is conducting a Phase 2 trial of CK‑2127107 (CK‑107), a skeletal troponin activator, in patients with SMA Types 2, 3 or 4 who are 12 years and older. In November 2017, Catalyst announced it initiated a Phase 2 trial for Firdapse (amifampridine), a small molecule that enhances neuromuscular junction transmission, in ambulatory SMA Type 3 patients.

  Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We intend to seek, maintain and defend our patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology and on know‑how, continuing technological innovation and in‑licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy. Additionally, we intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity and market exclusivity as well as patent term extensions, where available.
 Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know‑how related to our business; defend 

 
  17

 
and enforce licensed patent rights, and, if sought and obtained in the future, any patent rights we may own; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our current product candidate and any future product candidates may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to our licensed intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will issue with respect to any of the pending patent applications to which we license rights. With respect to any patent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future, if any, we cannot be sure that any such applications will issue or, if issued, that such applications will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidate and methods of manufacturing the same, or otherwise provide any competitive advantage. Even with respect to issued patents that we currently license, we cannot be certain that any such patents will provide any competitive advantage. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.
 We have licensed certain patents and patent applications and we have licensed or otherwise possess substantial know‑how and trade secrets relating to AVXS‑101, our product candidate that uses the AAV9 capsid. We believe that the patents and patent applications we have in‑licensed include claims that, if issued, would cover AVXS‑101 and that the latest to expire of such currently in‑licensed patent rights is a patent application owned by NCH and pending only in the United States that, if issued, would expire in 2029. Our proprietary, in‑licensed intellectual property, including patent and non‑patent intellectual property, generally is directed to AAV9 vectors, methods of treatment of clinical indications important for our development programs and processes to manufacture and purify AVXS‑101. We have also licensed certain patents and patent applications relating to our planned new programs in Rett syndrome and genetic ALS. We are heavily dependent on the patented or proprietary technologies that we license from third parties. We anticipate that we will require additional licenses to third party intellectual property rights relating to our development programs in the future, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
 Licensed Patents and Patent Applications
 We license patents and patent applications from NCH, REGENXBIO and AskBio as described below relating to AVXS-101 and NCH and REGENXBIO relating to our planned new programs in Rett syndrome and ALS. We also anticipate that additional patent or other intellectual property licenses, which we do not hold today, will likely be required for our commercial use of AVXS‑101, including use by intravenous and/or intrathecal injection, and our manufacturing processes. Moreover, additional licenses which we do not hold today will be required to the extent we seek to develop additional product candidates in the future. Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents and licenses, we rely on trade secrets and know‑how to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, and obtain and maintain ownership of certain technologies, in part, through confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know‑how, as well as that of our licensees, including by implementing measures intended to maintain the physical security of research facilities and the physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Our Collaboration and License Agreements
 Strategic Collaborators and Relationships
 An important factor to our success is our strategic partnerships and relationships. Our key research collaborator is NCH.
 AVXS-101
     To date, we have entered into three license agreements relating to the development of AVXS-101.

 
  18

 

 Nationwide Children’s Hospital
 In October 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with NCH, which we amended and restated in its entirety in January 2016, or the NCH SMA License. Pursuant to the NCH SMA License, NCH granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import any products covered by the NCH SMA License, or NCH SMA licensed products, and a non‑exclusive, worldwide license under certain technical information to develop and manufacture the NCH SMA licensed products, in the field of therapies and treatments of SMA. The patent rights exclusively in‑licensed from NCH and relevant to our contemplated SMA product are a currently pending patent application being pursued only in the United States. The patent application claims AVXS‑101 as a composition of matter and its use in treating SMA. If a patent issues from this patent application, it will expire in 2029. We have the right to subcontract the manufacturing of products using the licensed rights, such as AVXS‑101. We also have the right to sublicense the licensed technology to third parties through multiple tiers.
 Pursuant to the NCH SMA License, NCH filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, for AVXS‑101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1. Under the NCH SMA License, we received an option to elect to become the sponsor of the IND. Such option could be exercised on or after October 14, 2015. On October 14, 2015, we exercised the option and, as of November 6, 2015, we became the sponsor of the IND. However, NCH has reversionary rights in the case of an act or omission constituting negligence or willful misconduct with respect to our control of the IND that has or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the clinical trials conducted under the IND and such act or omission has not been cured within a certain period of time following receipt of written notice and demand from NCH.
 The NCH SMA License sets forth a development plan for our development of the licensed technology to make and sell NCH SMA licensed products, including AVXS‑101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1, throughout the world. We are required to achieve certain development milestones, including a specified minimum funding obligation of $9.4 million for the development of NCH SMA licensed products by 2021, which requirement NCH acknowledged we had fulfilled in whole as of the date of the amendment and restatement of the NCH SMA License. We are also required, if commercially reasonable, to market NCH SMA licensed products after regulatory approval, satisfy the market demand for such products in those countries in which we have obtained regulatory approval where it is commercially reasonable to do so and continue to develop additional NCH SMA licensed products within the field. In the event we fail to comply with such obligations, subject to certain conditions, NCH has the right to either terminate the NCH SMA License or convert our license into a non‑exclusive license with respect to the applicable NCH SMA licensed product in the applicable country. In addition, we are responsible for all clinical trial costs that are not covered by grants or certain other sources.
 In consideration for license rights granted to us, we initially issued NCH and The Ohio State University, or OSU, 331,053 shares of our common stock. Until May 2015, when we had reached a certain stipulated market capitalization, we were obligated to issue additional shares to NCH and OSU from time to time so that their aggregate ownership represented 3% (which percentage will be prorated downward if either NCH or OSU transfer any of such shares) of our issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully‑diluted basis.
 Following the first commercial sale of a NCH SMA licensed product, we must begin paying NCH an aggregate low‑single digit royalty on net sales of NCH SMA licensed products by us, our affiliates and sublicensees during the term of the NCH SMA License, with annual minimum royalties, in dollar amounts ranging from low five digits to low six digits, that increase over time. If we unsuccessfully challenge any of the licensed patents, the royalty rate increases from low single digits to mid‑single digits. These royalty rates are further subject to reduction in the event we have to license third‑party patents to exploit the licensed technology.
 With certain exceptions, we are required to make certain development milestone based payments to NCH. In addition, we must also pay NCH a portion of sublicensing revenue received from our sublicense of the rights to licensed technology at percentages between low‑double digits and low‑teens.
 We do not have the right to control prosecution of the in‑licensed patent rights, however NCH shall consult with us on material matters regarding the prosecution of such patent rights, and NCH has the first right to enforce any patents issuing from the in‑licensed patent rights and if NCH does not enforce the rights within a certain time frame, then 

 
  19

 
we have the right to enforce. In addition, our rights under the NCH SMA License are not assignable without the prior written consent of NCH, except to our affiliates, subsidiaries or any successor in interest in connection with a merger, acquisition, consolidation or sale, provided that our assignee assumes our obligations under the NCH SMA License in writing.
 Unless terminated earlier, the agreement will expire on a NCH SMA licensed product‑by‑NCH SMA licensed product and country‑by‑country basis upon the expiration of the royalty term for such NCH SMA licensed product in such country. The royalty term will expire on the later of (i) the date on which the last relevant patent underlying the relevant NCH SMA licensed product expires or (ii) ten years from the first commercial sale of NCH SMA licensed product in such country. Upon expiration of the agreement with respect to a particular NCH SMA licensed product in a particular country, the license to us will survive and as a fully‑paid up license. The NCH SMA License may be terminated prior to its expiration:

· | By us at any time by providing six months’ prior written notice to NCH;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | By either party upon the other party’s material breach of the NCH SMA License that is not cured within 90 days after receiving written notice of such breach, except in certain cases in which we may request a longer cure period;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | By NCH in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency or certain similar occurrences; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | By NCH if we or any of our affiliates bring any action or proceeding against NCH, other than a suit brought in response to any suit brought by NCH.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Certain accrued payments that we are required to make to NCH will become due in the event of termination as specified in the agreement. As of December 31, 2017, we have reimbursed NCH $0.5 million and incurred $161.7 million in aggregate development costs.
 The Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital
 In October 2013, we entered into a clinical trials research agreement with the Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, or the Research Institute. This agreement governs our preclinical and clinical trials conducted at NCH by Dr. Mendell.
 Under the NCH license agreement, we had the right to elect to become the sponsor of the IND subject to certain reversionary rights of the Research Institute. On October 14, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the NCH License with NCH permitting us to submit to the FDA for the transfer of the IND and associated regulatory filing to us and for us to become the sponsor of such IND. Contemporaneous with the execution of this amendment, we submitted the requisite documents to the FDA to initiate the transfer process. On November 6, 2015, the FDA approved our sponsorship of the IND. We are responsible for all budgeted clinical trial costs that are not covered by grants or certain other sources. All data and information generated under the agreement is subject to our agreements with NCH.
 Unless terminated earlier, the agreement expires upon the completion of the study. The agreement may be terminated prior to its expiration:

· | By either party upon the other party’s breach of the agreement that is not cured within 60 days after receiving written notice of such breach; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | By us at any time in the event we elect to become the sponsor of the IND.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our clinical trial research agreement with the Research Institute also contains obligations for us to indemnify the Research Institute and its affiliates against certain losses and for us to maintain certain insurance, as well as mutual confidentiality obligations.

 REGENXBIO, Inc.
 In March 2014, we entered into an exclusive license agreement or the REGENXBIO SMA License, with ReGenX Biosciences, LLC, or ReGenX, predecessor to REGENXBIO, under certain patents and patent applications owned by the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania and licensed to ReGenX, for the development and commercialization of products to treat SMA using AAV9. In January 2018, we entered into an amendment to the REGENXBIO SMA License, pursuant to which REGENXBIO granted us an exclusive, worldwide commercial license, with rights to sublicense, to any recombinant AAV vector in REGENXBIO’s intellectual property portfolio during the term of the license agreement for the treatment of SMA in humans by in vivo gene therapy. Under the REGENXBIO SMA License, REGENXBIO granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under the licensed patent rights to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale any products covered by the REGENXBIO SMA License, or REGENXBIO SMA licensed products, in the field of the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy in humans by in vivo gene therapy using such AAV vectors subject to certain rights reserved by REGENXBIO and its licensors. The patent rights exclusively in‑licensed include an issued United States patent, which expires September 2024, not including 473 days of patent term adjustment (as well as issued patents in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and China, which expire in 2024). These issued patents claim AAV9 vectors and viruses having an AAV9 capsid, as well as methods of use. In addition, the in‑licensed patent rights include pending patent applications in the United States, Canada, China, Europe and Japan, that if issued as patents, will expire in 2024. These pending applications claim AAV9 vectors and viruses having an AAV9 capsid, as well as its use in treatment. We have the right to sublicense the licensed technology to third parties subject to certain conditions as specified in the REGENXBIO SMA License. Under the REGENXBIO SMA License we grant a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free, transferable, sublicenseable, irrevocable, perpetual license back to REGENXBIO to (a) use any patentable modifications and improvements to the licensed technology that we or our affiliates or sublicensees develop, or licensed back improvements, and (b) to practice the licensed back improvements in connection with AAV9 outside of our field of use.
 Under the terms of the REGENXBIO SMA License, we paid or are required to pay:

· | an initial fee of $2.0 million;
--+--------------------------------


· | additional fees of (i) $80.0 million upon entry into the amendment to the REGENXBIO SMA License; (ii) $30.0 million on the first anniversary of the effective date of the amendment; and (iii) $30.0 million on the second anniversary of the effective date of the amendment;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an annual maintenance fee;
--+---------------------------


· | up to $120.0 million in sales-based milestone fees for all REGENXBIO SMA Licensed Products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | mid‑single digit to low double-digit royalty percentages on net sales of REGENXBIO SMA Licensed Products using AAV9, subject to reduction in specified circumstances;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a low-double digit royalty percentage on net sales of REGENXBIO SMA Licensed Products using an AAV vector other than AAV9, subject to reduction in specified circumstances; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | lower mid‑double digit percentages of any sublicense fees we receive from sublicensees for the licensed intellectual property rights.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As of December 31, 2017, we have paid $3.4 million under the REGENXBIO SMA License, which includes $1.3 million in aggregate milestone payments.
 The REGENXBIO SMA License requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, commercialize, market, promote and sell products utilizing the licensed patent rights in our field of use. We are obligated to achieve certain development milestones with respect to the licensed disease indication. We do not have the right to control 

 
  21

 
prosecution of the in‑licensed patent applications, and our rights to enforce the in‑licensed patents are subject to certain limitations.
 Under the amendment to the REGENXBIO SMA License, we are permitted to transfer the REGENXBIO SMA License without REGENXBIO’s consent in connection with a change of control of us, subject to the transferee or successor agreeing in writing to be bound by the terms of the REGENXBIO SMA License and the payment to REGENXBIO of the first and second anniversary fees of $30.0 million and $30.0 million, as well as the first $40.0 million in milestone fees, to the extent not already paid. Under the original REGENXBIO SMA License, any assignment by us without REGENXBIO’s prior written consent had been prohibited. 
 Our license agreement with REGENXBIO will expire upon the expiration, lapse, abandonment or invalidation of the last claim of the licensed intellectual property in all the countries of the world. We have the right to terminate the REGENXBIO SMA License upon a specified period of prior written notice. REGENXBIO may terminate the REGENXBIO SMA License if we or our affiliates become insolvent, if we are greater than a specified number of days late in paying money due under the REGENXBIO SMA License, or, effective immediately, if we or our affiliates, or sublicensees commence any action against REGENXBIO or its licensors to declare or render any claim of the licensed patent rights invalid or unenforceable. Either party may terminate the REGENXBIO SMA License for material breach if such breach is not cured within a specified number of days. Upon termination of the agreement, other than for REGENXBIO’s material breach, we grant to REGENXBIO a non‑exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty‑free, transferable, sublicenseable license under patentable modifications and improvements to any vector claimed by the licensed patents for use by REGENXBIO for the research, development and commercialization of products in any therapeutic indication.
 Asklepios Biopharmaceutical, Inc.
 In May 2015, we entered into a non‑exclusive license agreement with Asklepios Biopharmaceutical, Inc., or the AskBio License. Pursuant to the license agreement, AskBio granted us a non‑exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights and know‑how owned or controlled by AskBio, including certain patent rights owned by the University of North Carolina and licensed to AskBio, and relating to its self‑complementary DNA technology to develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, export and distribute any products covered by the AskBio License, or AskBio licensed products, for the treatment of SMA in humans. The in‑licensed patent rights are issued patents in the United States, and in Canada and Europe. There are two in‑licensed patent families. The first patent family expires in November 2019 worldwide. The second patent family includes three issued United States patents with expiry dates between May 2021 and August 2023. The foreign counterparts expire in 2021. The patents relate to self‑complementary technology and include claims to viral particles based on such technology, methods of manufacturing such viral particles, and methods of use in treatment. We have the right to sublicense the licensed technology to third parties with AskBio’s prior approval. We assign to AskBio all right, title and interest in and to defined improvements to the licensed technology that we make and all patent rights covering those improvements. In return, we receive a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free, transferable, sublicenseable, irrevocable, perpetual license to practice such improvements.
 The AskBio License required us to pay AskBio a one‑time upfront license fee of $1.0 million and an ongoing annual maintenance fee of $0.1 million each year during the term of the license agreement. We are also required to pay up to a total of $0.6 million in clinical development milestone payments and $9.0 million in sales based milestone payments.
 Under the terms of the AskBio License, we are required to pay AskBio annual tiered royalties based on the aggregate net sales of AskBio licensed products on a field‑by‑field basis starting at percentages in the low‑single digits and increasing to mid‑single digits. The royalties are payable on a country‑by‑country basis until the last to expire of the valid claims within the licensed patents that cover the AskBio licensed product in such country. These royalty rates are subject to reductions in specified circumstances, including, in the event we exercise our option to make a specified one‑time royalty option fee payment of $3.0 million to AskBio as further detailed in the AskBio License. We must also pay AskBio a low‑double digit percentage of all consideration we receive from our sublicense of the licensed technology.

 
  22

 

 We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, commercialize and sell AskBio licensed products for the treatment of SMA in humans throughout the term of the AskBio License. We do not have the right to control prosecution of the in‑licensed patent applications, and AskBio has the sole right, but not the obligation, to enforce the in‑licensed patents. In addition, our rights under the AskBio License are not assignable without the prior written consent of AskBio.
 Unless terminated earlier, the AskBio License automatically expires on the date on which we no longer have any payment obligation under the AskBio License. The AskBio License may be terminated prior to its expiration:

· | by us upon six months advance written notice to AskBio;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | by either party upon the other party’s breach of the AskBio License that is not cured within the specified cure period based on the nature of such breach;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | by either party in the event of either party’s bankruptcy, insolvency or certain similar occurrences;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | by AskBio if, during a specified period of time and subject to certain conditions being met, we research, develop or commercialize an AAV‑based treatment for hemophilia or we undergo a change of control with, or are otherwise acquired by, a third party that conducts such activities; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | by AskBio if we bring any action or proceeding challenging the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As of December 31, 2017, we have paid AskBio the $1.0 million upfront license fee and $0.6 million for a clinical development milestone payment.
 Preclinical Programs for Rett Syndrome and Genetic ALS
     We have also entered into three license agreements relating to our planned new programs for Rett syndrome and genetic ALS.
 REGENXBIO Inc.
     Effective June 7, 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with REGENXBIO under certain patents and patent applications owned by the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania and licensed to REGENXBIO, for the development and commercialization of products to treat Rett syndrome and genetic ALS using the AAV9 vector, or the REGENXBIO Rett and ALS License. Under the REGENXBIO Rett and ALS License, REGENXBIO granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under the licensed patent rights to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale any products covered by the REGENXBIO Rett and ALS License, or the REGENXBIO Rett and ALS licensed products, in the field of the treatment of (i) Rett syndrome in humans by in vivo gene therapy using AAV9 delivering the gene encoding for methyl CpG binding protein 2, and (ii) ALS caused by SOD1 mutation in humans by in vivo gene therapy using AAV9 delivering the gene encoding for SOD1, subject to certain rights reserved by REGENXBIO and its licensors. The patent rights exclusively in-licensed include an issued United States patent, which expires in 2026. We have the right to sublicense the licensed technology to third parties subject to certain conditions as specified in the REGENXBIO Rett and ALS License. Under the REGENXBIO Rett and ALS License we grant a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicenseable, irrevocable, perpetual license back to REGENXBIO to (a) use any patentable modifications and improvements to the licensed technology that we or our affiliates or sublicensees develop, or licensed back improvements, and (b) practice the licensed back improvements in connection with AAV9 outside of our fields of use.
  Under the terms of the REGENXBIO Rett and ALS License, we have paid or are required to pay:

· | an initial fee of $6.0 million;
--+--------------------------------

 
 
  23

 


· | an annual maintenance fee;
--+---------------------------


· | up to $36.0 million in total milestone fees for the REGENXBIO Rett and ALS licensed products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a low double-digit royalty percentage on net sales of REGENXBIO Rett and ALS licensed products, subject to reduction in specified circumstances; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a lower mid-double-digit percentage of any sublicense fees we receive from sublicensees for the licensed intellectual property rights.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   We are obligated to achieve certain development milestones with respect to the licensed disease indications. We do not have the right to control prosecution of the in-licensed patent applications nor the right to enforce the in-licensed patents. In addition, our rights under the REGENXBIO Rett and ALS License are generally not assignable without the prior written consent of REGENXBIO. 
     The REGENXBIO Rett and ALS License will expire upon the later of (i) the expiration, lapse, abandonment or invalidation of the last valid claim of the licensed intellectual property to expire, lapse or become abandoned or unenforceable in all the countries of the world or (ii) seven years from the first commercial sale of each REGENXBIO Rett and ALS licensed product. Upon expiration of the REGENXBIO Rett and ALS License, the license granted to us becomes irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free and fully paid-up. We have the right to terminate the REGENXBIO Rett and ALS License upon a specified period of prior written notice. REGENXBIO may terminate the REGENXBIO Rett and ALS License if we or our affiliates become insolvent, if we are greater than a specified number of days late in paying money due under the REGENXBIO Rett and ALS License, or, effective immediately, if we or our affiliates, or sublicensees commence any action against REGENXBIO or its licensors to declare or render any claim of the licensed patent rights invalid or unenforceable. Either party may terminate the REGENXBIO Rett and ALS License for material breach if such breach is not cured within a specified number of days. Upon termination of the REGENXBIO Rett and ALS License, other than for REGENXBIO’s material breach, we grant to REGENXBIO a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicenseable license under patentable modifications and improvements to any vector claimed by the licensed patents for use by REGENXBIO for the research, development and commercialization of products in any therapeutic indication. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we have paid REGENXBIO the initial $6.0 million fee.    Nationwide Children’s Hospital
     In September 2016, we entered into exclusive license agreements with NCH, pursuant to which NCH granted us exclusive, worldwide licenses under certain patent rights to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import any products covered by each license, or NCH licensed products, and a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain technical information to develop and manufacture the NCH licensed products, in the field of therapies and treatments of Rett syndrome and ALS in human use, respectively. We refer to each of the Rett syndrome and ALS in human use licenses individually as an NCH License. The patent rights exclusively in-licensed from NCH and relevant to our contemplated Rett syndrome product are a currently pending patent application being pursued only in the United States. The patent application covers the use of the AAV9 vector delivered intrathecally for the treatment of Rett syndrome. If a patent issues from this patent application, it is expected to expire in 2029. The patent rights exclusively in-licensed from NCH and relevant to our contemplated ALS product are a currently pending patent application being pursued in the United States, Canada and Europe. The patent application claims the use of the AAV9 vector as a composition of matter and its use for the treatment of ALS. If a patent issues from this patent application, it is expected to expire in 2035. We have the right to subcontract the manufacturing of products using the licensed rights under each NCH License. We also have the right to sublicense the licensed technology under each NCH License to third parties through multiple tiers.
 Each NCH License sets forth a development plan for our development of the licensed technology to make and sell NCH licensed products, including for the treatment of Rett syndrome and ALS in humans, as applicable, throughout the world. We are required, if commercially reasonable, to market NCH licensed products after regulatory approval, satisfy the market demand for such products in those countries in which we have obtained regulatory approval and where 

 
  24

 
it is commercially reasonable to do so and continue to develop additional NCH licensed products within the applicable field. In the event we fail to comply with such obligations, subject to certain conditions, NCH has the right to either terminate the applicable NCH License or convert our license into a non-exclusive license with respect to the applicable NCH licensed product in the applicable country. We are responsible for all clinical trial costs under each NCH License.
 We paid an initial fee of $0.2 million to NCH in connection with the NCH License for Rett syndrome and $0.1 million in connection with the NCH License for ALS in human use. We also must pay NCH an annual maintenance fee under each NCH License. Following the first commercial sale of an NCH licensed product under an applicable NCH License, we must begin paying NCH an aggregate low-single digit royalty on net sales of NCH licensed products by us, our affiliates and sublicensees during the term of such license. If we unsuccessfully challenge any of the licensed patents, the royalty rate increases from low single digits to high-single digits, in the case of the NCH License for Rett syndrome, and to mid-single digits, in the case of the NCH License for ALS in human use.
 With certain exceptions, we are required to make certain development milestone-based payments to NCH under each NCH License. In addition, we must also pay NCH a portion of sublicensing revenue received from our sublicense of the rights to licensed technology at a mid-single digit percentage.
 We do not have the right to control prosecution of the in-licensed patent rights under either NCH License, however NCH is required to consult with us on material matters regarding the prosecution of such patent rights, and NCH has the first right to enforce any patents issuing from the in-licensed patent rights and if NCH does not enforce the rights within a certain time frame, then we have the right to enforce. In addition, our rights under each NCH License are not assignable without the prior written consent of NCH, except to our affiliates, subsidiaries or any successor in interest in connection with a merger, acquisition, consolidation or sale, provided that our assignee assumes our obligations under the applicable NCH License in writing.
 Unless terminated earlier, each agreement will expire on a NCH licensed product-by-NCH licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the royalty term for such NCH licensed product in such country. The royalty term will expire on the later of (i) the date on which the last relevant patent underlying the relevant NCH licensed product expires or (ii) the expiration of any orphan drug-based exclusive marketing rights conferred by any regulatory authority with respect to a NCH licensed product in a licensed territory. Upon expiration of the agreement with respect to a particular NCH licensed product in a particular country, the license to us will survive and as a fully-paid up license. Each NCH License may be terminated prior to its expiration:

· | By us at any time after the second anniversary of the effective date of the applicable NCH License by providing six months' prior written notice to NCH;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | By either party upon the other party's material breach of the applicable NCH License that is not cured within 90 days after receiving written notice of such breach, except in certain cases in which we may request a longer cure period;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | By NCH in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency or certain similar occurrences; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | By NCH if we or any of our affiliates bring any action or proceeding against NCH, other than a suit brought in response to any suit brought by NCH.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Certain accrued payments that we are required to make to NCH will become due in the event of termination as specified in the applicable agreement.
 As of December 31, 2017, with respect to the NCH License for Rett syndrome, we have paid NCH the initial $0.2 million fee and $25,000 in annual maintenance fees, and, with respect to the NCH License for ALS, we have paid NCH the initial $0.1 million fee and $25,000 in annual maintenance fees.

 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biologic products including gene therapy products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and regulations and guidance implementing these laws. The FDCA, PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologic products. Applications to the FDA are required before conducting human clinical testing of biologic products. Additionally, each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product candidate is reviewed by the FDA and, in limited instances the National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, through its Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biologic products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
 Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Tissue and Advanced Therapies, or OTAT, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee, or the CTGTAC, to advise CBER on its reviews. CBER works closely with the NIH and the RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. FDA guidance documents on CMC, clinical investigations and other areas of gene therapy development are intended to facilitate the development of gene therapy products.
 Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 U.S. Biologic Products Development Process
 Our product candidate must be approved by the FDA before it may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND exemption, which allows human clinical trials to begin unless FDA objects within 30 days;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s GCP regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  26

 


· | preparation and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application (“BLA”) for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | payment of user fees and FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, including a gene therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually must complete some long‑term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documents must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or the OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA. However, many companies and other institutions, not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines, voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the RAC that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public.
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non‑compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.

 
  27

 

 Human Clinical Trials Under an IND
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators which generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
 Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or their legal representative, reviews and approves the study protocol, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials involving recombinant DNA also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research that utilizes recombinant DNA at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
 Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

· | Phase 1. The biologic product candidate initially is introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life‑threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. Phase 1 clinical trials of gene therapies are typically conducted in patients rather than healthy volunteers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a biologic product. In Phase 3 studies, the biologic product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the potency and safety of the product for approval. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Post‑approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long‑term safety follow‑up.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA.

 
  28

 

 Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for: serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other trials, in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life‑threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
 The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Additional Regulation for Gene Therapy Clinical Trials
 In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy‑related delayed adverse events for a 15‑year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire.
 The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene therapy trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials.
 Compliance with cGMP Requirements
 Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA will not approve a BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specification.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

 
  29

 

 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 The results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s CMC and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
 For gene therapies, selecting patients with applicable genetic defects is a necessary condition to effective treatment. For the therapy we are currently developing, we believe that diagnoses based on existing genetic tests developed and administered by laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, are sufficient to select appropriate patients and will be permitted by the FDA.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis The PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for approved biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non‑orphan indication.
 The FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In that event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth, substantive review of the BLA.
 The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product candidate. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements.
 On the basis of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.

 
  30

 

 If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post‑marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such goal is to review standard BLAs in ten months after the FDA accepts the BLA for filing, and priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a biologic product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biologic product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if the party holding the exclusivity fails to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan medicinal product status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits. For example, the European Union grants 10 years of product exclusivity for orphan medicinal products.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a biologic product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Biologic products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life‑threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval.

 
  31

 


· | Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives: intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross‑disciplinary review; and rolling review. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Accelerated approval. Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life‑threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well‑controlled post‑marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre‑approval of promotional materials. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Post‑approval Requirements
 Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biologic products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post‑approval requirements applicable to biologic products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record‑keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA, together with a release protocol, showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biologic products.
 A sponsor also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off‑label use”). Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal actions and adverse publicity. These actions could include refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, suspension or termination of a clinical trial by an IRB, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines or other monetary penalties, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare providers, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other civil or criminal penalties.

 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of product candidates, some of a sponsor’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period generally is one‑half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biologic product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. Moreover, a given patent may only be extended once based on a single product. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. Government Regulation Outside of the United States
 In addition to regulations in the United States, sponsors are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of biologic products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
 Whether or not a sponsor obtains FDA approval for a product, a sponsor must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, much like the IND, prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a request for a Clinical Trial Authorization, or CTA, must be submitted to the competent regulatory authorities and the competent Ethics Committees in the European Union Member States in which the clinical trial takes place, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA request is approved in accordance with the European Union and the European Union Member State’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Access to the Priority Medicines, or PRIME, initiative is granted by the European Medicines Agency, to support the development and accelerate the review of new therapies to treat patients with unmet medical need.
 The requirements and processes governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, as well as the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki (whichever provides the greater protection to the clinical trial participants).
 Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, fines, suspension, variation or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third‑party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and use of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third‑party payors, existing or potential customers and referral sources, including healthcare providers, are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, and these laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which manufacturers conduct clinical research, market, sell and distribute the products for which they obtain marketing approval. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:
· | the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in

cash or kind, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation;

Certain marketing practices, including off‑label promotion, also may implicate the FCA. In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act;

  Violation of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, individual imprisonment, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if a person becomes subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non‑compliance with 

 
  34

 
these laws. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly for manufacturers of branded prescription products.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any product candidates for which regulatory approval for commercial sale is obtained will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third‑party payors. Third‑party payors include government authorities and health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third‑party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third‑party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of FDA‑approved drugs for a particular indication. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost‑containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost‑containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.
 A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time‑consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
 Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. New metrics frequently are used as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, it may be necessary to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of the products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third‑party payors do not consider a product to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third‑party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third‑party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost‑effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross‑border imports from low‑priced markets exert 

 
  35

 
competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
 Health Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government‑funded healthcare programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
 By way of example, in March 2010, the PPACA was signed into law, intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the healthcare industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to our business are:

· | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (and 70% commencing January 1, 2019) point‑of‑sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new Patient‑Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Some provisions of the PPACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the PPACA. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for 

 
  36

 
health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to repeal or repeal and replace other elements of the PPACA.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Additionally, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.  At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 We expect that these initiatives, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government‑funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.
 Additional Regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other countries that impose similar obligations.
