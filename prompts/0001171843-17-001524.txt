Overview of the Business
 
Capstone Therapeutics Corp. (the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a biotechnology company committed to developing a pipeline of novel peptides and other molecules aimed at helping patients with under-served medical conditions. Previously, we were focused on the development and commercialization of two product platforms: AZX100 and Chrysalin (TP508). In 2012, we terminated the license for Chrysalin (targeting orthopedic indications). In 2014, we terminated the license for AZX100 (targeting dermal scar reduction). Capstone no longer has any rights to or interest in Chrysalin or AZX100.
 
On August 3, 2012, we entered into a joint venture, LipimetiX Development, LLC, (now LipimetiX Development, Inc.), (the “JV”), to develop Apo E mimetic peptide molecule AEM-28 and its analogs. The JV has a development plan to pursue regulatory approval of AEM-28, and/or an analog, as treatment for Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (granted Orphan Drug Designation by FDA in 2012) and other hyperlipidemic indications. The initial development plan extended through Phase 1a and 1b/2a clinical trials and was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. The clinical trials had a safety primary endpoint and an efficacy endpoint targeting reduction of cholesterol and triglycerides.
 
The JV received allowance from regulatory authorities in Australia permitting the JV to proceed with the planned clinical trials. The Phase 1a clinical trial commenced in Australia in April 2014 and the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial commenced in Australia in June 2014. The clinical trials for AEM-28 were randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of six escalating single doses (Phase 1a in healthy patients with elevated cholesterol) and multiple ascending doses of the three highest doses from Phase 1a (Phase 1b/2a in patients with hypercholesterolemia and healthy volunteers with elevated cholesterol and high Body Mass Index). The Phase 1a clinical trial consisted of 36 patients and the Phase 1b/2a consisted of 15 patients. Both clinical trials were completed in 2014 and the Medical Safety Committee, reviewing all safety-related aspects of the clinical trials, observed a generally acceptable safety profile. As first-in-man studies, the primary endpoint was safety; yet efficacy measurements analyzing pharmacodynamics yielded statistical significance in the pooled dataset favoring AEM-28 versus placebo in multiple lipid biomarker endpoints.
 
Concurrent with the clinical development activities of AEM-28, the JV has performed pre-clinical studies that have identified an analog of AEM-28, referred to as AEM-28-14, and a new formulation, that has the potential of increased efficacy, higher human dose toleration and an extended composition of matter patent life (application filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2015). The JV’s current intent is to prioritize the development of AEM-28-14.
 
The JV and the Company are exploring fundraising, partnering or licensing, to obtain additional funding to continue development activities of AEM-28-14, and operations.
 
The JV and the Company do not have sufficient funding at this time to continue additional material development activities of AEM-28-14. The JV may conduct future clinical trials in Australia, the USA, and other regulatory jurisdictions if regulatory approvals, additional funding, and other conditions permit.
 
The Company, funding permitting, intends to continue limiting its internal operations to a virtual operating model while monitoring and participating in the management of JV’s AEM-28-14 development activities.

Description of Current Peptide Drug Candidates.
 
Apo E Mimetic Peptide Molecule – AEM-28 and its analogs
 
Apolipoprotein E is a 299 amino acid protein that plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism. AEM-28 is a 28 amino acid mimetic of Apo E and AEM-28 and its analogs, including AEM-28-14, is a 28 amino acid mimetic of Apo E (with an aminohexanoic acid group and a phospholipid), and both contain a domain that anchors into a lipoprotein surface while also providing the Apo E receptor binding domain, which allows clearance through the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptors (Syndecan-1) in the liver. AEM-28 and its analogs, including AEM-28-14, as Apo E mimetics, have the potential to restore the ability of these atherogenic lipoproteins to be cleared from the plasma, completing the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, and thereby reducing cardiovascular risk. This is an important mechanism of action for AEM-28-14. For patients that lack LDL receptors (Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia-HoFH), or have hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia, AEM-28-14 may provide a therapeutic solution. Our joint venture has an Exclusive License Agreement with the University of Alabama at Birmingham Research Foundation for a broad domain of Apo E mimetic peptides, including AEM-28 and its analogs.
Company History
 
Prior to November 26, 2003, we developed, manufactured and marketed proprietary, technologically advanced orthopedic products designed to promote the healing of musculoskeletal bone and tissue, with particular emphasis on fracture healing and spine repair. Our product lines, which included bone growth stimulation and fracture fixation devices, are referred to as our “Bone Device Business.” In November 2003, we sold our Bone Device Business.
 
In August 2004, we purchased substantially all of the assets and intellectual property of Chrysalis Biotechnology, Inc., including its exclusive worldwide license for Chrysalin, a peptide, for all medical indications. Subsequently, our efforts were focused on research and development of Chrysalin with the goal of commercializing our products in fresh fracture healing. (In March 2012, we returned all rights to the Chrysalin intellectual property and no longer have any interest in, or rights to, Chrysalin.)
 
In February 2006, we purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of AzERx, Inc. Under the terms of the transaction, we acquired an exclusive license for the core intellectual property relating to AZX100, an anti-fibrotic peptide. In 2014, we terminated the License Agreement with AzTE (Licensor) for the core intellectual property relating to AZX100 and returned all interest in and rights to the AZX100 intellectual property to the Licensor.
 
On August 3, 2012, we entered into a joint venture, to develop Apo E mimetic peptide molecule AEM-28 and its analogs.
 
Our development activities represent a single operating segment as they shared the same product development path and utilized the same Company resources. As a result, we determined that it is appropriate to reflect our operations as one reportable segment.
 
OrthoLogic Corp. commenced doing business under the trade name of Capstone Therapeutics on October 1, 2008, and we formally changed our name from OrthoLogic Corp. to Capstone Therapeutics Corp. on May 21, 2010.
 
In these notes, references to “we”, “our”, “us”, the “Company”, “Capstone Therapeutics”, “Capstone”, and “OrthoLogic” refer to Capstone Therapeutics Corp. References to our joint venture or “JV”, refer to LipimetiX Development, Inc. (formerly LipimetiX Development, LLC).

Competition
 
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and confidentiality. Cholesterol reduction therapy is one of the largest drug markets served by numerous approved medications and with numerous potential therapies in various stages of clinical development. Well known cardiovascular drug classes include the statins and PCSK9s . Our drug candidates, if approved, would not compete directly for the same patient population as statins and PCSK9s. In the orphan indication of HoFH, two drugs received FDA approval in 2013: Juxtapid from Aegerion and Kynamro from Sanofi/Genzyme. Juxtapid is currently being marketed and sold; Kynamro has been withdrawn from market. We may not be aware of the other biotechnology, pharmaceutical companies or public institutions that are developing pharmaceuticals or devices that may compete with our potential products. We also may not be aware of all the other competing products our known competitors are pursuing. In addition, these biotechnology companies and public institutions compete with us in recruiting for research personnel and subjects, which may affect our ability to complete our research studies. For additional discussion regarding the risks associated with our competition, see the risk factor “If our JV’s product candidates do not gain market acceptance or our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our JV’s product candidates, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated” in the “Risk Factors” section in this Annual Report on Form 10K.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
AEM-28-14 is not currently available for sale and we do not expect it to be available for sale for some time into the future, if ever. Thus, neither we nor our JV currently have any marketing or sales staff. External consultants and members of our staff provide some technical marketing support relating to the development of, and market need for, new potential products and additional therapeutic applications of products already under research.
Research and Development
 
At December 31, 2016, we had two administrative employees and utilized consultants to perform various administrative, regulatory or research tasks. We have entered into consulting agreements with former employees in an effort to retain their availability to render services if and when needed.
 
Our research and development for 2016 and 2015 consisted primarily of work with or through our joint venture.
 
Through our joint venture, LipimetiX Development, Inc. (“JV”), we incurred expenses of $1.0 million ($.1 million when net of $946,000 allocated to Series B-1 Preferred Stock owners, as described in Notes 1 and 9 included in the financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and $1.0 million relating to AEM-28-14 research efforts in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The JV has a development plan to pursue regulatory approval of AEM-28-14, as treatment for Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (AEM-28 was granted Orphan Drug Designation by FDA in 2012) and other hyperlipidemic indications. The initial development plan extended through Phase 1a and 1b/2a clinical trials and was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. The clinical trials had a safety primary endpoint and an efficacy endpoint targeting cholesterol and lipid reduction.
 
In early 2014, JV received allowance from regulatory authorities in Australia permitting the JV to proceed with the planned clinical trials of AEM-28. The Phase 1a clinical trial commenced in Australia in April 2014 and the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial commenced in Australia in June 2014. The clinical trials for AEM-28 were randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of six escalating single doses (Phase 1a in healthy patients with elevated cholesterol) and multiple ascending doses of the three highest doses from Phase 1a (Phase 1b/2a in patients with hypercholesterolemia and healthy subjects with elevated cholesterol and high Body Mass Index). The Phase 1a clinical trial consisted of 36 patients and the Phase 1b/2a consisted of 15 patients. Both clinical trials were completed in 2014 and the Medical Safety Committee, reviewing all safety-related aspects of the clinical trials, observed a generally acceptable safety profile. As first-in-man studies, the primary endpoint was safety; yet efficacy measurements analyzing pharmacodynamics yielded statistical significance in the pooled dataset favoring AEM-28 versus placebo in multiple lipid biomarker endpoints.

Concurrent with the development activities with AEM-28, the JV performed limited pre-clinical studies that have identified an analog of AEM-28, referred to as AEM-28-14, and a new formulation, that has the potential of greater efficacy, higher human dose toleration and an extended composition of matter patent life (application filed in 2015). AEM-28-14 has become the JV’s lead drug candidate for commercial development.
 
Manufacturing
 
Currently, third parties certified under Good Manufacturing Practices manufacture AEM-28-14 for the JV in limited amounts for our clinical and pre-clinical studies. We use a primary manufacturer for the peptides used in our human clinical trials, but secondary manufacturers are available as needed. AEM-28-14 chemistry, manufacturing and control plan is currently based on an infusion formulation.
Patents, Licenses and Proprietary Rights
 
The JV has an Exclusive License Agreement (the “Agreement) with the University of Alabama at Birmingham Research Foundation (“UABRF”) covering a broad domain of Apo-E mimetic peptides including AEM-28 and certain analogs (included as Exhibit 10.7 to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2012, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 10, 2012, and as amended effective December 15, 2014, included as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Current report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 30, 2015). The Agreement calls for payment of patent filing, maintenance and other related patent fees, as well as a royalty of 3% on Net Sales of Licensed Products during the Term of the Agreement. The Agreement terminates upon the expiration of all Valid Patent Claims within the Licensed Patents, currently estimated to be 2035. The Agreement, as amended, also calls for annual maintenance payments of $25,000, various milestone payments of $50,000 to $500,000 and minimum royalty payment of $500,000 to $1,000,000 per year commencing on January 1 of the first calendar year following the year in which the First Commercial Sale occurs. UABRF will also receive 5% of Non Royalty Income received.
Insurance
 
Our business entails the risk of product liability claims. We currently have no product liability coverage. We are not currently engaged in clinical trials. We maintain a general liability insurance policy and an umbrella excess liability policy. There can be no assurance that liability claims will not exceed the coverage limit of such policies or that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Product liability claims or claims arising from our clinical trials could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have not experienced any material liability claims to date resulting from our clinical trials.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had two administrative employees in our operations and utilize consultants to perform a variety of administrative, regulatory or research tasks. We have entered into consulting agreements with various former key employees, but there is no assurance that these persons will be available in the future to the extent their services may be needed. As a research and development business, we believe that the success of our business will depend in part on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified research personnel, both as employees and as consultants. We face competition from private companies and public institutions for qualified research personnel. None of our employees are represented by a union and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

Safe Harbor
 
We may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our reports to stockholders. The safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 protects companies from liability for their forward looking statements if they comply with the requirements of that Act. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to that safe harbor. These forward-looking statements relate to future events or to our future financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “may,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements since they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond our control and which could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations, which we describe in more detail in this section titled “Risks,” include, but are not limited to:

· | failure of the Company, or its joint venture, LipimetiX Development, Inc., to obtain additional funds to continue operations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | effect of non-compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) Rules and Regulations requiring our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, to include an opinion of an Independent Public Accountant;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the impact of the terms or conditions of agreements associated with funds obtained to fund operations;

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the impact of present and future joint venture, collaborative or partnering agreements or the lack thereof;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what we projected. Any forward-looking statement you read in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflects our current views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, business strategy and liquidity. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.
 
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K has been filed with the SEC without an opinion of an independent public accountant, as required by current SEC rules and regulations, and as required to be listed on the OTCQB Markets.
 
Our current level of funds available for operation has led to additional cost cutting, which included the decision to not engage an independent public accountant to audit and express an opinion on our December 31, 2016 or 2015 financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as required by current SEC rules and regulations, and as required to be listed on the OTCQB Market. We cannot currently predict the response to this action by the SEC or the OTCQB Market, nor the effects of their action on the continued financial viability of the Company or the trading of its common stock. The decision to not engage an independent public accountant to audit and express an opinion on our December 31, 2016 or 2015 financial statements could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its Stockholders.
 
The audit opinion from our independent accounting firm, Moss Adams, LLC, on our December 31, 2014 financial statements, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 16, 2015, includes an explanatory paragraph as to an uncertainty with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
We had accumulated deficit balance of $190 million as of December 31, 2016. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.7 million. We currently have no pharmaceutical products being sold or ready for sale and do not expect to be able to introduce any pharmaceutical products or generate any revenue for at least several years. We expect to incur losses for at least the next several years. Our cash reserves are the primary source of our working capital. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company with no revenue generating operations and high investment costs. Therefore, we will require additional funding to realize revenue from any of our JV’s product candidates, and we may never realize any revenue if our JV’s product candidates cannot be commercialized. 
 

9
-

 
Our current level of funds is not sufficient to support continued research to develop our JV’s product candidates, and will not be sufficient to fund all the research expenses necessary to achieve commercialization of any of our JV’s product candidates. We will require substantial additional capital, and/or a development partner, to complete the clinical trials and supporting research and production efforts necessary to obtain FDA or comparable foreign agencies’ approval, if any, for our JV’s product candidates. We may not receive any revenue from our JV’s product candidates until we receive regulatory approval and begin commercialization of our JV’s product candidates. We cannot predict whether, or when, that might occur.
 
Our JV partners have significant rights as minority-interest stockholders of our JV. Although we effectively own 59.3% of the outstanding shares of our JV’s common stock, the noncontrolling stockholders of the JV have the right to appoint a majority of the JV’s board of directors.
 
Pursuant to a Stockholders Agreement among all the stockholders of our JV, we have agreed that the board of directors of the JV will be composed of three individuals designated by the noncontrolling common stockholders, one individual designated by the Series B-1 Preferred Stock owners, and two individuals designated by us. Consequently, our designees do not control the JV’s board of directors. If the JV fails to operate substantially in accordance with its annual budget, including the milestones specified therein, or fails to comply with its obligations under the Stockholders Agreement, we will thereafter have the right to appoint a majority of the members of the JV’s board of directors.
 
Under the Stockholders Agreement, the consent of stockholders acting by a majority in interest is required for a broad range of actions, including annual budgets and operational milestones. Because we are the majority stockholder, these consent rights protect our interests in the JV. However, there is a risk that these consent rights may be insufficient to protect our interests or may result in impasses with respect to the JV’s management and operation, the resolution of which might result in actions, agreements or consequences that we might view as suboptimal. There is no assurance that the minority stockholders of the JV will share the same economic, business or legal interests or goals that we have for the JV's business.
 
Our business is subject to stringent regulation, and if we do not obtain regulatory approval for our JV's product candidates, we will not be able to generate revenue.
 
Our JV’s research, development, pre-clinical and clinical trial activities and the manufacture and marketing of any products that it may successfully develop are subject to an extensive regulatory approval process by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and abroad. The process of obtaining required regulatory approvals for pharmaceutical products is lengthy, expensive and uncertain, and any such regulatory approvals may entail limitations on the indicated usage of a product, which may reduce the product’s market potential.
 
None of our JV's product candidates have been approved for sale. In order to obtain FDA or comparable foreign agency approval to commercialize any product candidate, a New Drug Application (NDA) (or comparable foreign agency form) must be submitted demonstrating, among other things, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use in humans for each target indication. Our or our JV’s regulatory submissions may be delayed, or we or our JV may cancel plans to make submissions for product candidates for many reasons, including unfavorable results from or delays in preclinical or clinical trials and lack of sufficient available funding.
 
If we experience delays in our JV’s clinical trials, we will incur additional costs and our opportunities to monetize product candidates will be deferred. Delays could occur for many reasons, including the following:
 

· | the FDA or other health regulatory authorities, or institutional review boards, do not approve a clinical study protocol or place a clinical study on hold;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | suitable patients do not enroll in a clinical study in sufficient numbers or at the expected rate, or data is adversely affected by trial conduct or patient drop out;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | patients experience serious adverse events, including adverse side effects of our JV’s product candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | patients in the placebo or untreated control group exhibit greater than expected improvements or fewer than expected adverse events;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


10
--


· | third-party clinical investigators do not perform the clinical studies on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical study protocol and good clinical practices, or other third-party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | service providers, collaborators or co-sponsors do not adequately perform their obligations in relation to the clinical study or cause the study to be delayed or terminated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of the particular product candidate or any other components needed for pre-clinical testing or clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | regulatory inspections of manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us or a co-sponsor to undertake corrective action or suspend the clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the interim results of the clinical study are inconclusive or negative;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the clinical study, although approved and completed, generates data that is not considered by the FDA or others to be sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions affect the conduct of the clinical trial or the interpretation of its result;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | there is a change in the focus of our JV’s development efforts or a re-evaluation of its clinical development strategy; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we lack of sufficient funds to pay for development costs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 
Consequently, we cannot assure that we or our JV will make submissions to the FDA or comparable foreign agencies in the timeframe that we have planned, or at all, or that our and our JV’s submissions will be approved by the FDA or comparable foreign agencies. Even if regulatory clearance is obtained, post-market evaluation of our JV’s future products, if required, could result in restrictions on a product’s marketing or withdrawal of a product from the market as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions.
 
If our JV’s product candidates do not gain market acceptance or our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our JV’s product candidates, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.
 
Even if our JV brings one or more products to market, there is no assurance that our JV will be able to successfully manufacture or market the products or that potential customers will buy them. Market acceptance will depend on our ability to demonstrate to physicians and patients the benefits of the future products in terms of safety, efficacy, and convenience, ease of administration and cost effectiveness, as well as on our JV’s ability to continue to develop product candidates to respond to competitive and technological changes. In addition, we believe that market acceptance depends on the effectiveness of our marketing strategy, the pricing of our JV’s future products and the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors. Physicians may not prescribe our JV’s future products, and patients may determine, for any reason, that our JV’s product is not useful to them. Insurance companies and other third party payors may determine not to reimburse for the cost of the product.
 
Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense and is expected to increase. Several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic laboratories, universities and other research institutions, are involved in research and/or product development for indications targeted for use by AEM-28-14. Most of our competitors have significantly greater research and development capabilities, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing, marketing, financial and managerial resources than we have.
 
Our competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective than the ones we have under development or that render our proposed products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. In addition, certain of our competitors may achieve product commercialization before we do. If any of our competitors develops a product that is more effective than one that our JV is developing or plans to develop, or is able to obtain FDA or comparable foreign agencies’ approval for commercialization before we do, we may not be able to achieve significant market acceptance for certain of our JV’s products, which would have a material adverse effect on our JV’s business.

For a summary of the competitive conditions relating to indications which we are currently considering for AEM-28 and its analogs, see “Competition” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
If we cannot protect our joint venture’s AEM-28, AEM-28-14 and other patents, or our JV’s intellectual property generally, our JV’s ability to develop and commercialize its future products will be severely limited. 
 
Our success will depend in part on our joint venture’s ability to maintain and enforce patent protection for AEM-28, AEM-28-14 and each resulting product. Without patent protection, other companies could offer substantially identical products for sale without incurring the sizable discovery, development and licensing costs that our joint venture has incurred. Our JV’s ability to recover these expenditures and realize profits upon the sale of products would then be diminished.
 
AEM-28 is patented and patent applications for the AEM-28 analogs have been filed. There have been no successful challenges to the patents. However, if there were to be a challenge to these patents or any of the patents for product candidates, a court may determine that the patents are invalid or unenforceable. Even if the validity or enforceability of a patent is upheld by a court, a court may not prevent alleged infringement on the grounds that such activity is not covered by the patent claims. Any litigation to enforce our JV’s rights to use its or its licensors’ patents will be costly, time consuming and may distract management from other important tasks.
 
As is commonplace in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ, or engage as consultants, individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. To the extent our employees or consultants are involved in research areas which are similar to those areas in which they were involved at their former employers, we may be subject to claims that such employees or consultants and/or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims, which could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and which may have a material adverse effect on us, even if we are successful in defending such claims.
 
We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information. We seek to protect this information, in part, through the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, advisors and others. Nonetheless, we cannot assure that those agreements will provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information and prevent their unauthorized use or disclosure. The risk that other parties may breach confidentiality agreements or that our trade secrets become known or independently discovered by competitors, could adversely affect us by enabling our competitors, who may have greater experience and financial resources, to copy or use our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the advancement of their products, methods or technologies.
 
Our success also depends on our JV’s ability to operate and commercialize products without infringing on the patents or proprietary rights of others.
 
Third parties may claim that our JV or its licensors or suppliers are infringing their patents or are misappropriating their proprietary information. In the event of a successful claim against our JV or its licensors or suppliers for infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of others, our JV may be required to, among other things:
 

· | pay substantial damages;
--+-------------------------


· | stop using our JV’s technologies;
--+----------------------------------


· | stop certain research and development efforts;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | develop non-infringing products or methods; and
--+------------------------------------------------


· | obtain one or more licenses from third parties.
--+------------------------------------------------

A license required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be available to our JV, or may not be available on acceptable terms. If our JV or its licensors or suppliers are sued for infringement, our JV could encounter substantial delays in, or be prohibited from, developing, manufacturing and commercializing its product candidates.
 
Our reliance on third party clinical research organizations and other consultants could have a material effect on our JV’s ability to conduct clinical trials and perform research and development. Product development costs to our JV and our JV’s potential collaborators will increase, and our JV’s business may be negatively impacted, if we experience delays in testing or approvals or if our JV needs to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned.
 
To obtain regulatory approvals for new products, our JV must, among other things, initiate and successfully complete multiple clinical trials demonstrating to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities that our JV’s product candidates are sufficiently safe and effective for a particular indication. We currently rely on third party clinical research organizations and other consultants to assist our JV in designing, administering and assessing the results of those trials and to perform research and development with respect to product candidates. In relying on those third parties, we are dependent upon them to timely and accurately perform their services. If third party organizations do not accurately collect and assess the trial data, our JV may discontinue development of viable product candidates or continue allocating resources to the development and marketing of product candidates that are not efficacious. Either outcome could result in significant financial harm to us.
 
The loss of key management and scientific personnel may hinder our JV’s ability to execute our business plan.
 
As a small company our success depends on the continuing contributions of our management team and scientific consultants, and maintaining relationships with the network of medical and academic centers in the United States and centers that conduct our clinical trials. We have reduced our staff to two administrative employees and utilize consultants to perform a variety of administrative, regulatory or research tasks. We have entered into consulting agreements with various former key employees, but there is no assurance that these persons will be available in the future to the extent their services may be needed.
 
If we are not successful in retaining the services of former key employees it could materially adversely affect our business prospects, including our ability to explore partnering or development activities.
 
Our joint venture is managed under contract by Benu BioPharma Inc., which is comprised of two individuals (Dennis I. Goldberg, Ph.D., and Eric M. Morrel, Ph.D.). These individuals are minority stockholders in our JV.
 
Although there is a services contract with Benu BioPharma Inc., there is no direct agreement with these individuals for continued services and they are under no legal obligation to remain with Benu BioPharma Inc. We can give no assurance that all or any of these individuals will continue to provide services to our joint venture. Should any of these individuals not continue to provide services to our joint venture, it could have a material adverse effect on our joint venture’s ability or cost to develop AEM-28 and its analogs.
 
Possible side effects of our JV’s product candidates may be serious and life threatening. If one of our JV’s product candidates reveals safety or fundamental efficacy issues in clinical trials, it could adversely impact the development path for our JV’s other current product candidates for that peptide. We face an inherent risk of liability in the event that the use or misuse of our JV’s future products results in personal injury or death.
 
The occurrence of any unacceptable side effects during or after pre-clinical and clinical testing of our JV’s product candidates, or the perception or possibility that our JV’s product candidates cause or could cause such side effects, could delay or prevent approval of our JV’s products and negatively impact its business. The use of our JV’s product candidates in clinical trials may expose us and our JV to product liability claims, which could result in financial losses. Our clinical liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us or our JV. In addition, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us and our JV against losses. Any claims against us or our JV, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources and adversely impact or eliminate the prospects for commercialization of the product which is the subject of any such claim.

Healthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursements may limit our financial returns.
 
Our ability to successfully commercialize our products may depend in part on the extent to which government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third party payors will reimburse consumers for the cost of these products. Third party payors are increasingly challenging both the need for, and the price of, novel therapeutic drugs and uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investments in research and product development, which could restrict our ability to commercialize a particular product candidate.
 
Risks Related to our Common Stock
 
The trading volume in our common stock is limited and our stock price is volatile, and therefore stockholders may not be able to sell their shares in desired amounts at the reported trading prices.
 
The trading price for our common stock, which is traded in the over-the-counter market, has varied significantly in the past (from a high of $9.32 to a low of $0.04 during the period of January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2016) and may vary in the future due to a number of factors, including:
 

· | announcement of the results of, or delays in, preclinical and clinical studies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the response by the SEC or the OTCQB Market to our decision not to engage an Independent Public Accountant to audit and express an opinion on our December 31, 2016 or 2015 Financial Statements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fluctuations in our operating results;
--+---------------------------------------


· | developments in litigation to which we or a competitor is subject;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | announcements and timing of potential partnering, development collaboration or licensing transactions, merger, acquisitions, divestitures, capital raising activities or issuance of preferred stock;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA and other regulatory actions;
--+----------------------------------


· | developments with respect to our or our competitors’ patents or proprietary rights;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or others; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us, other drug development companies or the pharmaceutical industry generally.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our common stock is thinly traded, in part because over-the-counter trading volumes are generally significantly lower than those on stock exchanges. The trading volume for our common stock often varies widely from day to day. Because of the low trading volume, a relatively small amount of trading may greatly affect the trading price, the trading price may be subject to amplified decreases upon the occurrence of events affecting our business, and investors should not consider an investment in our common stock to be liquid. In addition, the broader stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and these broad market fluctuations may be even more pronounced for our thinly traded stock.
 
Future share issuances may have dilutive and other material effects on our stockholders.
 
We are authorized to issue 150,000,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2016, there were 40,885,411 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. However, the total number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding does not include shares reserved in anticipation of the exercise of options, warrants or additional investment rights. As of December 31, 2016, we had options outstanding to purchase approximately 3,611,706 shares of our common stock, the exercise price of which ranges between $0.05 per share to $1.53 per share, and we have reserved shares of our common stock for issuance in connection with the potential exercise thereof. To the extent additional options are granted and exercised or additional stock is issued, the holders of our common stock will experience further dilution. At December 31, 2016, no shares remain available to grant under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan.

In addition, in the event that any future financing or consideration for a future acquisition should be in the form of, be convertible into or exchangeable for, equity securities, investors will experience additional dilution.
 
Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws will make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors(“Board”) and may discourage takeover attempts that some of our stockholders may consider beneficial.
 
Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. These provisions include, among other things, the following:
 

· | a classified Board with three-year staggered terms;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholders’ meetings;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the ability of our Board to fill vacancies on the board;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | a prohibition against stockholders taking action by written consent;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | supermajority voting requirements for the stockholders to modify or amend our bylaws and specified provisions of our certificate of incorporation, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the ability of our Board to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These provisions are not intended to prevent a takeover, but are intended to protect and maximize the value of our stockholders’ interests. While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our Board, they could enable our Board to prevent a transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits business combinations with interested stockholders. Interested stockholders do not include stockholders whose acquisition of our securities is pre-approved by our Board under Section 203.
 
We may issue additional shares of preferred stock that have greater rights than our common stock and also have dilutive and anti-takeover effects. 
 
We have 2,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock, the terms of which may be fixed by our Board. We presently have no outstanding shares of preferred stock. Our Board has the authority, without stockholder approval, to create and issue one or more series of such preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend and other rights of holders of such preferred stock. If we raise additional funds to continue development of AEM-28 and its analogs, or operations, we may issue preferred stock. The issuance of any of such series of preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the holders of common stock.
 
We have not previously paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
 
We have not in the past paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future decision to pay a dividend on our common stock and the amount of any dividend paid, if permitted, will be made at the discretion of our Board.
 
The development of Apo E mimetic peptide molecule AEM-28 and its analogs by our joint venture may not result in a liquidity event or a liquidity event, if one occurs, may be insufficient in size and our investment in LipimetiX Development, Inc. may not be recovered.
 

15
--

 
On August 3, 2012, we entered into a joint venture with LipimetiX, LLC (now LipimetiX Development, Inc.) to develop the Apo E mimetic peptide AEM-28 and its analogs and we contributed $6 million to the joint venture and at December 31, 2016 we have loaned an additional $1.6 million to the joint venture. Our cash contribution to the joint venture represents a substantial proportion of our available cash.
 
The initial funded development plan was focused on the development of treatments using AEM-28 for Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia and Refractory Hypercholesterolemia and extended through Phase 1a and 1b/2a clinical trials, which were completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our pre-clinical studies or clinical trials results may not be viewed by potential partners, licensees or acquirers, as successful, and we may not recover our investment. Even if our development efforts are viewed as successful, a liquidity event, if any, may be insufficient in size to recover our investment.
 
Our joint venture is unable to continue additional development of AEM-28-14 without additional funding support and the Company does not have sufficient funds to continue either its operations or development funding, which may impair the ability of the joint venture or the Company to continue on a going concern basis. 
 
There is no assurance that we will have adequate funds available, or that we can obtain needed funding from third parties on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If the joint venture cannot complete its development work as planned due to a lack of funds, the value of our investment would be impaired, perhaps materially, as would be our ability to continue as a going concern.
