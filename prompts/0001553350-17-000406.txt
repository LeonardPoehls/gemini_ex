ITEM 1.
 BUSINESS.
Ecosphere Technologies, Inc. (Ecosphere, ETI or the Company) is a technology development and intellectual property licensing company that develops environmental solutions for global water, energy, industrial and agricultural markets. We help industry increase production, reduce costs, and protect the environment through a portfolio of unique, patented technologies: technologies like Ozonix®, the Ecos PowerCube® and the Ecos GrowCube, which are available for sale, as well as exclusive and nonexclusive licensing opportunities across a wide range of industries and applications throughout the world.

The Ecosphere technologies and products are available through multiple brands and subsidiaries that include Sea of Green Systems, Inc. (SOGS), Ecosphere Development Company, LLC (EDC) and Fidelity National Environmental Solutions, LLC (FNES).

Business Strategy

The Companys management team executes on a business strategy that is driven by open innovation and innovative manufacturing. Open Innovation is a concept that was developed by Dr. Henry Chesbrough, the Executive Director of the Center for Open Innovation at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. The Open Innovation concept provides a formula whereby small companies can rapidly develop and deploy new technologies and then license those technologies to larger organizations for rapid market penetration. In response to this concept, we developed the Open Innovation Network, our product development lifecycle that can be characterized by the following six stages:

1.
 Identify a major environmental challenge,
 2.
 Invent new technologies and file patents,
 3.
 Partner with industry leaders, 
 4.
 Commercialize and prove the technology with ongoing services paid for by customers and industry leaders,
 5.
 License the patented, commercialized technologies to well capitalized partners that are geographically located, and
 6.
 Create recurring revenues and increase shareholder value.

As a result, the Company has designed, developed, manufactured and commercialized a wide variety of patented technologies that are currently solving some of the worlds most critical water and environmental challenges. Our multi-patented Ozonix® technology is a revolutionary, high volume, Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) designed to treat and recycle industrial wastewater without the use of toxic chemicals, while our patented Ecos PowerCube® is a mobile, solar-powered generator designed to maximize the amount of solar power that can be placed in a standard ISO shipping container footprint. In addition to the Companys patented Ozonix® and Ecos PowerCube® technologies, the Company has launched its Sea of Green Systems, Inc. subsidiary which sells high-tech growing equipment, lighting solutions and nutrients to the Precision Agriculture industry. Most recently, the Company has formed Ecosphere Development Company, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, to build and lease turn-key, high-tech growing facilities in locations around the United States that are geographically, politically and economically well positioned. EDC is currently constructing its first 6 acre project in Washington State that is zoned as I-502 heavy industrial agricultural land for legal marijuana cultivation and processing. 

These patented technologies and corresponding trademarks can be purchased and licensed for use in large-scale and sustainable applications across industries, nations and ecosystems. Companies that license our patented technologies are able to improve their financial metrics while also reducing their ecological and environmental footprints. Although our other technologies and patents remain a viable part of our long-term technology licensing strategy, the Company is currently focused on selling and manufacturing high-tech growing equipment and proprietary nutrients through SOGS and developing its first Canntech Agriculture Center in Washington State.

OZONIX®

Many water recycling processes use chemicals - chemicals that are costly and harmful to the environment. Ecospheres patented Ozonix® water treatment technology offers customers a chemical-free alternative to high-volume water disinfection and recycling for a diverse range of industries and applications ranging from the oil and natural gas industry and mining to agriculture and municipal wastewater treatment.


1


Description

Ozonix® technology combines multiple forms of AOPs into one broad-spectrum water treatment technology to oxidize and destroy organic matter, bacteria, biofilms, heavy metals, hydrocarbons and sulfides that are typically found in industrial wastewaters. Ozonix® eliminates the need for conventional liquid chemical biocides and scale-inhibitors that are typically required to control bacteria growth and scale deposition in a wide variety of wastewater treatment and disinfection applications. The patented Ozonix® process can also be used to produce an environmentally safe oxidant that can be used as a leaching agent or for further disinfection.

The patented Ozonix® process, in summary, saturates contaminated water with ozone (O3) and uses hydrodynamic cavitation, acoustical cavitation and electrochemical oxidation to oxidize and destroy micro-organisms. As water cycles through an Ozonix® reactor, bacteria cell walls are destroyed and contaminates are oxidized, returning clean water that is ready for use, re-use and/or final treatment for discharge applications.

Although Ecosphere has recently begun to license Ozonix® outside of the energy sector as described later in this Report, it has primarily been used in the U.S. oil and gas industry where its effectiveness and competitive advantages have been proven. The global energy field-of-use is licensed to Fidelity National Environmental Solutions, LLC (FNES), a company organized by Ecosphere, of which Ecosphere currently owns a 30.6% interest.

Ecosphere currently owns 59.92% of SOGS and is the exclusive manufacturer of all of its products. 

Ecosphere Development Company, LLC.

In April 2016, the Company formed EDC, a Washington State Limited Liability Company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Ecosphere Technologies. EDC was developed to build and lease turn-key, high-tech growing facilities in locations around the United States that are geographically, politically and economically well positioned. EDCs first project is located in southeastern Washington where EDC is currently developing Phase 1 of a six (6) acre project that is zoned as I-502 heavy industrial agricultural land for legal marijuana cultivation and processing. Phase 1 of EDCs CannaTech Agriculture Center includes approximately 10,000 square feet of high-tech, supplemental light deprivation greenhouses with another 6,000 square feet of operations facilities that will be leased to a legal, licensed tenant for long-term, recurring rental income. 

The Company spent the last two years locating and acquiring the property as well as designing the facilities it is currently building in WA. This new business segment requires infrastructure and equipment financing to develop the entire 6 acres, of which EDC will continue to build in phases. In July 2016, the Company closed on its first $1,000,000 financing agreement to fund the Phase 1 and continues to raise capital throughout the building process. In addition, the Company and EDC have raised $0.9 million in selling 9.75% of Phase 1 of the Cannatech Agriculture Center future revenues. 

Fidelity National Environmental Solutions, LLC or FNES

FNES, a leading water treatment provider to the energy services sector, has an exclusive field-of-use license for Ecosphere's multi-patented Ozonix® technology for global energy applications including, but not limited to, onshore and offshore oil and natural gas exploration and production, power generation, refineries and coal. During the height of the U.S. hydraulic fracturing industry, FNES provided licensing partners and energy exploration companies with patented Ozonix® mobile wastewater treatment equipment to eliminate harmful chemicals from hydraulic fracturing operations. This resulted in the Company treating 6+ Billion gallons of water for more than 1,600 oil and natural gas wells, manufacturing and deploying approximately 60 OZONIX® systems throughout the United States and Canada. 

FNES is presently inactive due to the downturn in the Oil and Gas industry and regularly evaluates its options as well as strategic opportunities that might become available. 

Ecosphere currently owns 30.6% of FNES and has historically been the exclusive manufacturer of all Ozonix® related products for the Energy field-of-use license. Its exclusive manufacturing rights with FNES expired in May 2015 with the Company maintaining the exclusive rights to make, use, sell and license its multi-patented Ozonix® process for all non-energy related applications. 

Description of Business Over Five Years

Over the past three years, the Company has concentrated most of its efforts on developing its line of high-tech growing equipment and technologies for its newest subsidiary, SOGS and launching EDC. Prior to the development of SOGS, the Company spent significant time improving its multi-patented Ozonix® technology and the equipment through which it delivers services to oil and gas exploration and production companies. To date, Ecospheres Ozonix® technology has been used to treat, recycle and reuse over six (6) billion gallons of water on more than 1,600 oil and natural gas wells, protecting $6+ billion worth of well assets, and generating over $70 million in combined equipment sales, service and licensing revenue.

2011-2012

Following our then record revenue of $21.1 million in 2011, in 2012, we continued the manufacturing and delivery of Ozonix® EF80 units to an oil and gas customer. FNES continued its services to its energy customers. In 2012, we generated record revenues of $31.1 million, again with the increase due to the sale of 12 Ozonix® EF80 units to our customer.

2013-2014

In 2013, we experienced a change in a relationship with our customer. During the first quarter as required by our agreement, we manufactured units 13 and 14. However, our customer was unable to pay for the units and in mid-April 2013, lost its exclusive license. We ultimately sold units 13 and 14 later in the year to FNES in exchange for cash and monthly payments over a three-year period. The Company has since sold the Notes Receivable for the two Ozonix® EF80 units in exchange for $2.4 million, FNES makes monthly payments to the note holders, but in January 2015, FNES entered into a forbearance agreement with the note holders which waives monthly payments through June 30, 2015. FNES will pay $15,000 per month per note payable beginning July 1, 2015 through the notes due dates. In May and July, Fidelity National Financial, Inc. [NYSE:FNF], a Fortune 500 company, increased its investment in FNES by paying Ecosphere $10 million for 20% of that subsidiary. Ecospheres management team estimates that this sale represents approximately 2% of the estimated value of Ecospheres global Ozonix® intellectual property portfolio. Once we fell below the 50% ownership threshold, we ceased to be the managing member. FNF also obtained an option to purchase an additional 12% for $6 million by December 31, 2013 and that option lapsed. 

In June 2013, Ecosphere announced its newest product for the oil and gas hydraulic fracturing market, the Ozonix® EF10M. The Ozonix® EF10M was an addition to Ecospheres highly successful line of Ecos-Frac® mobile water treatment products that have been used to treat and recycle over six billion gallons of water for more than 1,600 oil and natural gas wells around the United States.

In November 2013, the Company sold its first Ozonix® EF10M to FNES, which was later sold to Hydrosphere Energy Solutions (Hydrosphere), a Canadian sub-licensee of FNES in January 2014.

In December 2013, Ecosphere announced completion of its first Ozonix® O.R.E Recovery Equipment system for Ecosphere Mining, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ecosphere and a new Mobile Operations Vehicle that is designed to remain on location for extended periods of time when Ecosphere is demonstrating its Ozonix® system for customers around the United States. In November 2014, Ecosphere sold the Mobile Operations Vehicle due to the depressed status of the mining & minerals market.

Late in 2013, the United States Patent Office (USPTO), after seven years, issued a patent for our Ecos PowerCube®. As a result, we spent a significant portion of 2014 designing and manufacturing multiple prototypes and have begun to seek a financial or strategic partner to license the Ecos PowerCube® for numerous industries and applications globally. 

In January 2014, Ecosphere announced that FNES signed an exclusive technology licensing and equipment purchase agreement with Hydrosphere, a Canadian corporation, to deploy its patented Ozonix® water treatment technology in Alberta and the Northeast part of British Columbia, Canada. Hydrosphere has not met the criteria listed above to maintain its exclusivity. 

In July 2014, Ecosphere announced an exclusive technology licensing and equipment purchase agreement with Brasil Clean Energy ("BCE"), a Brazilian environmental services company, to deploy its patented Ozonix® water treatment technology across the food and beverage industry in Brazil. BCE was required to purchase a minimum of $5 million worth of Ozonix® equipment over two years, plus a royalty payment based on usage or revenue, with a minimum amount earned per machine. BCE did not meet its purchase requirements in order to maintain its exclusive license. As of the date of this Report, BCE has purchased $0.5 million worth of Ozonix® equipment. In September 2014, the Company completed manufacturing, testing and delivery of BCE's first piece of equipment, an Ozonix® EF10M mobile water treatment system capable of treating approximately 420 gallons-per-minute in a 10x12 footprint. 

In November 2014, Ecosphere formed SOGS to begin to execute on its monetization strategy for the recently announced Ecos GrowCube technology and SOGS product lines. The subsidiary has received a royalty-free, global field of use license for the Ecos GrowCube technology as well as Ecospheres multi-patented Ozonix® water treatment technology for all agriculture related applications globally.

The contaminated water is introduced into the St. Lucie Canal from the polluted waters of Lake Okeechobee. The St. Lucie Estuary and Indian River Lagoon are one of the most bio diverse ecosystems in North America, with more than 4,000 plant and animal species, including 36 endangered and threatened species. 

In July 2015, SOGS received its first equipment purchase order of high-tech growing equipment to Waveseer Properties, LLC (Waveseer) for approximately $1.3 million. The Company manufactured and delivered this order in Q1 2017. In addition, the Company delivered its first self-contained Ecos GrowCube unit during Q3 2015, currently in the Companys inventory as finished goods, for a trial period to this customers facility in Las Vegas, NV to successfully demonstrate the technologys competitive advantages and growing capabilities. The Ecos GrowCube has completed numerous successful crop trials since then and is regularly used as a demonstration piece of equipment for the Companys technologies and capabilities. 

In February 2016, the Company announced that the USPTO approved U.S. Patent # 9,266,752, which relates to the field of fluid treatment and specifically an improved treatment apparatus for destroying aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in fluids used in oil and gas recovery and conditioning of said fluids for reuse without generating a residual waste stream. Receipt of this Patent marked the 14th approved United States Patent for Ecospheres multi-patented and proven Ozonix® technology. 

In 2016, Ecosphere received a total of 1 additional, approved United States Patents for its Ozonix® technology, bringing the total count to 14 approved U.S. Patents with Numerous Patents always pending. Approved Ozonix® Patents include U.S. Patent No's. 7,699,994; 7,699,988; 7,785,470; 7,943,087; 8,318,027; 8,721,898; 8,858,064; 8,936,392; 8,906,242; 8,968,577; 8,999,154; 9,034,180; 9,169,146; and 9,266,752. 

In July 2016, the Companys subsidiary, EDC, closed on a $1,000,000 financing agreement to fund the first phase of EDC's Cannatech Agriculture Center, to be constructed in Washington State. The Cannatech Agriculture Center will be a turnkey, high tech growing facility that will incorporate Ecosphere's automated growing and patented water treatment technologies to maximize the production, quality and yield of products grown within the facility. The Cannatech Agriculture Center will be leased to legal, licensed I-502 growers in Washington that will pay monthly rent and licensing fees to EDC for the use of the facility and proprietary growing technologies. At the time of this filing, the Company expects to complete Phase 1 of the CannaTech Agriculture Center during the summer months of 2017. 

In July 2016, the Company announced that it completed a one week operation to revitalize a local marina that was virtually shut down due to a toxic cyanobacteria "blue-green algae" bloom the size of a football field with 4" to 12" thick of toxic algae and hundreds of dead fish on the surface. Presenting not only an environmental disaster, but also a health hazard to the local community, Ecosphere deployed its Ozonix® technology, equipment and personnel at its own cost to help save the local business and to demonstrate the effectiveness of its patented, high-volume, chemical-free water treatment technology.

In November 2016, SOGS executed a Technology Licensing Agreement with EDC to utilize SOGS products, technologies, software, nutrients and Agronomic consulting services in its operations. In exchange for this right, EDC expects to pay SOGS an agreed upon monthly licensing fee for each growing facility that EDC builds and leases to licensed marijuana growers. For each one of the four Phases of the Cannatech Ag Center, EDC expects to compensate SOGS $25,000 per month in Technology Licensing and Royalty Payments for the life of the lease term or $100,000 per month, which will equate to $1,200,000 per year for potentially up to 30 years or the life of EDCs land and tenant leases.
