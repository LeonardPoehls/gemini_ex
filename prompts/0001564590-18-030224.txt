Item 1. Business
Company Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from our proprietary cannabinoid product platform in a broad range of disease areas. In our 20 years of operations, we have established a world leading position in the development of plant-derived cannabinoid therapeutics through our proven drug discovery and development processes, our intellectual property portfolio and regulatory and manufacturing expertise. Our lead cannabinoid product is Epidiolex oral solution CV, a pharmaceutical formulation of cannabidiol (CBD), for which we retain global commercial rights. Epidiolex was approved by the FDA on June 25, 2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or LGS, or Dravet syndrome, in patients two years of age and older. LGS and Dravet syndrome are severe childhood-onset, drug-resistant epilepsy syndromes.  On September 28, 2018, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) placed Epidiolex in Schedule V, the lowest restriction classification. Epidiolex became commercially available in the U.S. on November 1, 2018. 
 In Europe, we submitted an application for Epidiolex to the European Medicines Agency’s, or EMA’s, Committee for Medical Products for Human Use (CMPH) in December 2017, and we expect a decision on the application in the first quarter of 2019. We have received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for Epidiolex for LGS, Dravet syndrome and tuberous sclerosis complex, (TSC). We also received Orphan Designation from the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medical Products (COMP) for Epidiolex for Dravet syndrome, LGS, and TSC. We continue to develop Epidiolex for additional indications, including the treatment of seizures associated with TSC and plan to commence a pivotal trial in the treatment of Rett syndrome.
 Previously, we developed the world’s first plant-derived cannabinoid prescription drug, Sativex (nabiximols), which is approved for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis in numerous countries outside the U.S. In the U.S., we have full commercial rights to this product and plan to meet with the FDA in the fourth quarter 2018 to discuss data from the completed Phase 3 trials in Europe and determine the optimal regulatory pathway.
 We have a deep pipeline of additional cannabinoid product candidates focusing primarily on orphan childhood-onset neurologic conditions and oncology. Our pipeline includes research in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Rett syndrome using both CBD and cannabidivarin (CBDV). We reported positive Phase 2 data for our CBD:THC product in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. We have also reported positive Phase 2 data in schizophrenia. In addition, we have received Orphan Drug Designation 
 4

and Fast Track Designation from the FDA for intravenous CBD for the treatment of Neonatal Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (NHIE), for which a Phase 1 trial has been completed.
 Our Marketed Products 
 Epidiolex
 Approval and U.S. Launch
 Epidiolex was approved by the FDA on June 25, 2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with LGS or Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older. The FDA confirmed orphan drug exclusivity for Epidiolex and granted us a rare pediatric disease voucher. Following the approval, DEA placed Epidiolex in Schedule V and commercial Epidiolex became available on November 1, 2018. 
 
We have reported positive results from two LGS Phase 3 pivotal trials, both achieving the primary endpoint of a median reduction in monthly drop seizures compared with placebo. The first study compared a single Epidiolex 20 mg/kg dose arm to placebo in 171 patients (p=0.0135) and the second compared both a 20 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Epidiolex dose arm to placebo in 225 patients (p=0.0047 and p=0.0016 respectively). In January 2018, the results of the single-dose LGS trial were published in The Lancet and in May 2018, the results of the second multi-dose trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
 
We have also reported positive results from two Phase 3 pivotal trials in Dravet syndrome. The first study in 120 patients achieved the primary endpoint of a median reduction in monthly convulsive seizures of a Epidiolex 20 mg/kg dose arm compared with placebo (p=0.012). In May 2017, the results of this trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. In November 2018, the results of a second trial were announced which compared both a 20 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Epidiolex dose arm to placebo in 199 patients. In this trial both doses achieved the primary endpoint of a median reduction in monthly convulsive seizures (p=0.0299 and p=0.0095 respectively). 
 
Epidiolex demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in these Phase 3 pivotal trials. The most common adverse reactions that occurred in Epidiolex-treated patients were somnolence; decreased appetite; diarrhea; transaminase elevations; fatigue, malaise, and asthenia; rash; insomnia, sleep disorder and poor-quality sleep; and infections. The Company’s development program represents the only well-controlled clinical evaluation of a cannabinoid medication for patients with LGS and Dravet syndrome.
 
With Epidiolex now available by prescription, our U.S. subsidiary, Greenwich Biosciences, will market the product through an experienced commercial organization consisting of sales, medical affairs, marketing, and market access/payer teams. The U.S. sales team includes two National Directors, eight Regional Managers and 66 Neurology Account Managers and will target approximately 5,000 physicians who treat patients with LGS or Dravet syndrome. In addition, our medical affairs organization has been in place for over two years and includes 15 Medical Science Liaisons. Our U.S. marketing plan includes a combination of community neurology/epilepsy meetings, patient advocacy events, an extensive program for U.S. clinicians to share their Epidiolex experiences and a media-based awareness program.
 
We set a list price for Epidiolex of $1,235 per 100mL bottle. Based on anticipated dosing and patient weight assumptions, we believe that this translates to a weighted average gross price in the first year of approximately $32,500, which is in line with other branded anti-epileptic drugs used to treat these conditions. We have introduced a patient support program that will provide patient and caregiver focused education and help provide resources that may lower patients’ out-of-pocket costs or provide product at no cost to eligible patients. Leading up to the commercial availability we have had very productive meetings with commercial and Medicaid payers. Initial coverage policies are being written to ensure appropriate utilization, which is aligned to our strategy. We are continuing to make progress to ensure that Epidiolex is reimbursed for appropriate use with minimal patient disruption. To that end, we recently came to an agreement with one of the nation’s largest payers to cover Epidiolex as a preferred brand with electronic steps as utilization management. 
 
Approximately 1,200 patients from the expanded access program (EAP) and open label extension (OLE) from the pivotal trials are currently receiving Epidiolex in the form of clinical research product. Our most important priority for these patients is to ensure continuity of treatment. As such, we will be focusing initially on new patients with immediate need for Epidiolex and will work with physicians, likely through mid-2019, to gradually migrate EAP and OLE patients to commercial product.
 Epilepsy Market Overview 
 According to the Epilepsy Foundation, approximately 3.4 million people in the U.S. live with epilepsy. According to Kwan and Brodie in the February 2000 edition of The New England Journal of Medicine, 36 percent of patients with epilepsy were pharmacoresistant even after the use of three anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs). Furthermore, it is recognized that some of those that do find relief often suffer side effects severe enough with their current medication that an alternative or adjunct treatment is often sought. The 
 5

costs of uncontrolled epilepsy are significant, with direct and indirect costs associated with epilepsy totaling more than $15 billion per year. It is estimated that 50,000 epilepsy related deaths occur each year, more than breast cancer deaths annually. 
 According to Russ et al. in the February 2012 edition of Pediatrics, there are 466,000 childhood epilepsy patients in the U.S. and 765,000 patients in Europe, of which 30 percent, or about 140,000 patients in the U.S. and about 230,000 in Europe, are deemed medically intractable or pharmacoresistant. 
 Dravet Syndrome 
 Dravet syndrome is a severe infantile-onset, genetic, drug-resistant epilepsy syndrome with a distinctive but complex electroclinical presentation. Onset of Dravet syndrome occurs during the first year of life with clonic seizures (jerking) and tonic-clonic (convulsive) seizures in previously healthy and developmentally normal infants. Symptoms peak at about five months of age, and the latest onset beginning by 15 months of age. Other seizures develop between one and four years of age such as prolonged focal dyscognitive seizures and brief absence seizures, and duration of these seizures decreases during this period, but their frequency increases. Prognosis is poor, with death occurring in approximately 14 percent of children. Death can be caused by the seizures themselves, by infection due to prolonged periods of physical inactivity, or by the presence of advanced neurodegenerative disease or a compromised level of consciousness requiring a feeding tube. Death can also occur suddenly due to uncertain causes, often because of the relentless neurological decline or from Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy. Patients develop intellectual disability and life-long ongoing seizures. Intellectual impairment varies from severe (50 percent of patients), to moderate (25 percent of patients), to mild (25 percent of patients). Patients rarely return to normal intellect. 
 According to Forsgren L. et al. in the 2004 edition of Epilepsy in Children, the incidence of epilepsy in the first year of life is 1.5 per 1,000 people, or, by our estimate, 6,450 new epilepsies per year worldwide. According to Dravet et al. in the 2012 edition of Epileptic Syndromes in Infancy, Childhood and Adolescence, up to 5 percent of epilepsies diagnosed in the first year of life are Dravet syndrome, equating to 320 new cases per year in the U.S. with a mortality rate that may be as high as 15 percent in the first 20 years of life. By our estimate, there are approximately 5,440 patients with Dravet syndrome in the U.S. under the age of 20 years. Applying the same assumptions in Europe, we believe there are an estimated 6,710 Dravet syndrome patients in the European Union under the age of 20 years. 
 A large percentage of cases of Dravet syndrome have a family history of epilepsy or convulsions. Heterozygous de novo mutations of the alpha 1 (α-1) subunit of the SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel, are the cause of Dravet syndrome in 75 percent to 80 percent of patients and more than 500 SCN1A mutations have been reported to be associated with this disorder. The standard of care usually involves a combination of the following anticonvulsants: clobazam, clonazepam, leviteracetam, topirimate, valproic acid, ethosuximide or zonisamide. Stiripentol is approved for the treatment of Dravet syndrome in conjunction with clobazam and valproate. Potent sodium channel blockers used to treat epilepsy actually increase seizure frequency in patients with Dravet syndrome. The most common are phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and rufinamide. Management of this disease may also include a ketogenic diet, and physical and communication therapy. In addition to anti-convulsive drugs, many patients with Dravet syndrome are treated with anti-psychotic drugs, stimulants and drugs to treat insomnia. 
 Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome 
 LGS is a type of epilepsy with multiple types of seizures, particularly tonic (stiffening) and atonic (drop) seizures. According to Trevathan et al. in the December 1997 edition of Epilepsia, the estimated prevalence of LGS is between 3 percent and 4 percent of childhood epilepsy cases. LGS affects between 14,500 to 18,500 children under the age of 18 years in the U.S. and over 30,000 children and adults in the U.S. Eighty percent of children with LGS continue to experience seizures, psychiatric, intellectual and behavioral deficits in adulthood. Seizures due to LGS are hard to control and generally require life-long treatment. 
 Drug resistance is one of the main features of LGS. Generally, treatment requires broad spectrum AEDs and/or polypharmacy. Treatment also depends on the seizure type as some treatments effective for one type of seizure may worsen another. The FDA approved treatments for LGS are: Onfi (clobazam); Banzel (rufinamide); Lamictal (lamotrigine); Topamax (topirimate); and Felbatol (felbamate). These medicines are often used as adjunctive therapy with other AEDs and they show some efficacy, however, many also have severe undesirable side effects. Furthermore, several of these medicines are based on the same mechanism of action as traditional AEDs. As patients with LGS generally need to take several treatments to gain any change to their seizure frequency, we believe that there is a need for further pharmacological treatments, particularly those with a different mechanism of action, to give prescribers more options in treating this rare, pharmacoresistant syndrome. 
 
Epidiolex Manufacturing
 We manufacture Epidiolex through utilization of in-house and external third-party facilities for various steps in the production process. We have expanded various parts of the production process both in-house and with external third parties in readiness for commercial launch. As part of the NDA review, the FDA pre-approval inspections of our manufacturing facilities did not 
 6

result in any Form 483 observations. We are continuing to expand our Epidiolex manufacturing capacity in anticipation of post-U.S. launch and projected demand in Europe and elsewhere.
 
Epidiolex European Union Regulatory
 In Europe, we submitted a marketing authorization application in December 2017 for both the Dravet syndrome and LGS indications. This application has been validated by the EMA and the decision is expected in the first quarter of 2019. We have submitted 121-day responses to the CMPH questions. We have also received Orphan Designation for LGS, Epidiolex for Dravet syndrome and TSC.
Epidiolex European Union Commercial
 We continue to make good progress for the commercialization of Epidiolex in Europe and are planning initial launches in the five major European markets in 2019. Our commercial leadership team is now fully recruited and in place. This experienced team, which includes several epilepsy disease experts, is focused on progressing the necessary pricing and reimbursement, medical and pre-commercial activities required to deliver a successful European launch. In particular, significant progress is being made on building the local country organizations in the five major European markets. This first wave of local recruitment is very much focused on leadership and medical staff. Medical affairs activities are progressing well with national advisory boards now completed in all the major markets and significant presence and data exposure at key European and National Congresses. 
 
Epidiolex Follow-On Target Indication: TSC
 TSC is a genetic disorder that causes non-malignant tumors to form in many different organs, primarily in the brain, eyes, heart, kidney, skin and lungs. The brain and skin are the most affected organs. TSC results from a mutation in tumor suppression genes TSC1 or TSC2. According to the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance, TSC is estimated to affect approximately 50,000 patients in the U.S. The most common symptom of TSC is epilepsy, which occurs in 75 – 90 percent of patients, about 70 percent of whom experience seizure onset in their first year of life. Approximately 60 percent of these TSC patients (or approximately 25,000 of patients in the U.S.) have treatment-resistant seizures. The seizures of TSC are typically focal in onset, meaning that they are localized to one hemisphere of the brain. There are significant co-morbidities associated with TSC including cognitive impairment in 50 percent, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), in up to 40 percent and neurobehavioral disorders in over 60 percent of individuals with TSC. 
 Several patients with TSC have been treated with Epidiolex in the expanded access program. Treatment experience in 18 TSC patients with refractory epilepsy from the Massachusetts General Hospital for Children enrolled in the expanded access program has been published in Epilepsia (Hess et al. - 2016). The findings from this study suggest that cannabidiol may be an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with refractory seizures in TSC, but the significance of such findings is limited without further study.
 
We are progressing a Phase 3 trial of Epidiolex in patients with TSC. This dose-ranging trial, which is now fully recruited (n=210), is a 16-week comparison of Epidiolex versus placebo to assess the safety and efficacy of Epidiolex as an adjunctive anti-epileptic treatment. The primary measure of this trial is the percentage change from baseline in seizure frequency during the treatment period. Primary endpoint seizure types include focal motor seizures with or without impairment of consciousness or awareness and generalized convulsive seizures. Data from this trial is expected in the first half of 2019. Subject to positive results, we expect to submit a supplemental NDA for Epidiolex in TSC in the second half of 2019.
 Epidiolex Follow-On Target Indication: Rett
 
Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare, non-inherited, X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 live female births.  RTT is most commonly caused by heterozygous de-novo mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) resulting in a loss of function of the MeCP2 protein. The condition affects predominantly females and it results in abnormal neuronal development and function in affected children. The symptomatology of RTT is progressive, with early onset from about 6–18 months of life, followed by a rapid destructive phase at the age of 1 to 4 years. This stage is characterized by loss of purposeful hand skills, loss of spoken language, breathing and cardiac irregularities, microcephaly, and autistic-like behaviors. After the period of regression, patients enter a prolonged period of stabilization where most of the impairments associated with the destructive phase persist together with apraxia, motor problems, and seizures. Over time, the patient’s motor function continues to deteriorate, resulting in reduced mobility, scoliosis, rigidity, muscular weakness and spasticity. 
 
There are no approved treatments for RTT. The management options target specific symptoms and are not without undesirable side effects. As such, there is currently a high unmet medical need. Data from animal models suggest CBD may be able to improve deficits in cognition, language, social behavior and motor function, as well as having the potential to modulate the cellular mechanisms thought to be involved in the neurobehavioral deficits present in RTT. In addition, clinical evidences from open label 
 7

investigations in patients with refractory epilepsy suggest that Epidiolex may have beneficial effects on cognition, behavior and quality of life, which could benefit patients with RTT.
 
A Phase 3 trial of Epidiolex in patients with RTT is expected to start in the second quarter of 2019. It is an international multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate safety and efficacy. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of up to 24 weeks of treatment with Epidiolex, compared with placebo, in reducing symptom severity in patients with RTT using the Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ) and the Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement (CGI-I).
 
Epidiolex Formulation Life Cycle Management
 In addition to the Epidiolex formulation, we continue to develop additional formulations of CBD as part of its life cycle management plan. We are developing a capsule to provide more convenient administration, particularly for adults and older children across our target indications. We are also developing an improved oral solution. 
Epidiolex Intellectual Property
 In addition to seven years of orphan exclusivity plus the expected six-month pediatric extension (to be filed), we seek to protect Epidiolex through the expansion of our patent portfolio. Our patent portfolio relating to the use of CBD in the treatment of epilepsy includes 25 distinct patent families that are either granted or filed. Most of the patent families in this portfolio claim the use of CBD in the treatment of particular childhood epilepsy syndromes, seizure sub-types and interactions with other concomitantly dosed anti-seizure drugs. To date, we have obtained ten patents and received notices of allowance for two applications from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, including claims for the use of CBD for the treatment of convulsive, drop and atonic seizures associated with both LGS and Dravet syndrome, as well as the use of CBD with clobazam, and the teaching that dose adjustment may be needed when concomitantly prescribed. Some of these patents are directly aligned with the Epidiolex label and we have listed them in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the Orange Book). These patents have expiry to 2035. We continue to identify novel findings and submit patent applications resulting from the Epidiolex development program and we expect additional grants from these applications.
Sativex
 Sativex is an oromucosal spray of a formulated extract of the cannabis sativa plant that contains the principal cannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, and CBD in a 1:1 ratio as well as specific minor cannabinoids and other non-cannabinoid components (the product has been granted the U.S. Adopted Name, or USAN, of nabiximols). We developed Sativex to be administered as an oromucosal spray, whereby the active ingredients are absorbed in the lining of the mouth, either under the tongue or inside the cheek. At this time, we have received regulatory approval for Sativex in numerous countries outside the U.S. 
 Sativex in the U.S. 
 In December 2017, we terminated our license agreement with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., in relation to Sativex in the U.S. and we have reacquired full ownership of the development and commercialization rights to the product in the U.S. We expect to meet with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2018 to determine the most efficient regulatory pathway to an NDA for Sativex for the treatment of MS spasticity, where already we have completed three positive Phase 3 trials in Europe.
 Beyond an initial target U.S. indication of MS spasticity, we believe that Sativex has significant additional market potential. We have completed over 10 placebo-controlled trials and believe there is the potential for future development of multiple indications.
 Sativex in Europe
 To support the development and commercialization of Sativex in Europe, we have license and development agreements with the following major pharmaceutical companies: Almirall S.A., or Almirall, in Europe (excluding the U.K.) and Mexico; Bayer HealthCare AG, or Bayer, in the U.K. and Canada; Ipsen Biopharm Ltd, or Ipsen, in Latin America (excluding Mexico and the Islands of the Caribbean); and Neopharm Group, or Neopharm, in Israel. These agreements provide our collaborators with the sole right to commercialize Sativex in exclusive territories for all indications. 
Sativex Intellectual Property
 Our strategy is to seek and obtain patents related to Sativex across all major pharmaceutical markets around the world. In the U.S., our patents (and our pending applications if they issue) relating to Sativex would expire on various dates between 2021 and 2027, excluding possible patent term extensions. We have at least seven different patent families containing one or more pending and/or issued patents directed to the Sativex formulation, the extracts from which Sativex is composed, the extraction technique used to produce the extracts and the therapeutic use of Sativex.

Our Product Pipeline
 Proprietary Cannabinoid Product Platform 
 The cannabis plant is the unique source of more than 70 structurally related, plant-derived cannabinoids. Although one cannabinoid, THC, is known to cause psychoactive effects associated with the use of illicit herbal cannabis, none of the other cannabinoids are known to share this property. In recent decades, there have been major scientific advances that have led to the discovery of new plant-derived cannabinoids and a cannabinoid receptor system in the human body, or endocannabinoid system. We are at the forefront of this new area of science, and we believe that our proprietary cannabinoid product platform uniquely positions us to discover and develop cannabinoids as new therapeutics. 
 Our proprietary cannabinoid product platform consists of our: 
  
• | continually evolving library of internally generated novel cannabis plant types that produce selected cannabinoids, or chemotypes. We can reproduce the selected chemotypes through propagation of plant cuttings, or clones, in order to ensure that all subsequent plant material is genetically uniform. We can also generate seeds of selected chemotypes for large-scale production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in-house extraction, processing methodologies and analytical techniques, which yield well-characterized and standardized chemotype extracts;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | discovery of novel cannabinoid pharmacology through conducting in vitro and in vivo pharmacologic evaluation studies in validated disease models to determine the most promising potential therapeutic areas for each extract;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in-house formulation and manufacturing capabilities, supplemented by third-party contractors;

GWP42006 (CBDV) in Epilepsy, Rett and ASD 
 GWP42006 features CBDV as the primary cannabinoid. CBDV has shown anti-epileptic properties across a range of in vitro and in vivo models of epilepsy. 
 We have also evaluated GWP42006 in both general and syndromic pre-clinical models of ASD yielding promising signals on cognitive and social endpoints as well as repetitive behavior. These animal models include both genetically determined abnormalities of neurobehavioral, and chemically-induced models, and include Rett syndrome and Fragile X among others. Many of the pediatric intractable epilepsy conditions within the Epidiolex expanded access program share considerable overlap with ASD and these conditions often fall within the orphan disease space. Initial clinical observations from treating physicians suggest a potential role for cannabinoids in addressing problems associated with ASD such as deficits in cognition, behavior and communication. 
 We have completed a Phase 1 trial of GWP42006 in 66 healthy subjects. In this trial, GWP42006 was well tolerated even at the highest tested dose. There were no serious or severe adverse events reported, nor any withdrawals due to adverse events. 
 We are working on various clinical initiatives for CBDV within the field of ASD. A physician-led expanded access IND is underway to treat seizures associated with autism in 20 patients. An investigator-led 100 patient placebo-controlled trial in autism is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2018.  In November 2018, we filed an IND for a company-sponsored trial in ASD, which we expect to commence in 2019. An open-label proof of concept study is expected to commence in the first half of 2019 evaluating CBDV in 30 children with Rett syndrome and seizures. CBDV in Rett Syndrome has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA.
 In February, we announced that a Phase 2a study of CBDV in adult patients with focal seizures did not meet its primary endpoint. We are currently evaluating next steps for this indication.
 CBDV Intellectual Property Portfolio 
 We have a portfolio of intellectual property relating to CBDV for use in various indications including epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder. These patent families include issued and pending claims to use of CBDV alone or in combination with standard anti-epileptic drugs in the treatment of seizures, and pending claims to the use of CBDV in the treatment of ASD and associated conditions. Other families include pending claims directed to the use of CBDV in other therapeutic areas such as neuropathic pain, Alzheimer’s disease and Duchenne’s disease, CBDV compositions and CBDV extracts. We anticipate additional patent applications being filed as new data is generated.

Other Orphan Product Candidates 
 Glioblastoma 
 We are evaluating a combination product containing GWP42002:GWP42003 (CBD:THC) in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM, a particularly aggressive brain tumor. We have received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA and the EMA for this indication. 
 GBM describes any tumor that arises from the glial tissue of the brain. GBM is a particularly aggressive tumor that forms from abnormal growth of glial tissue. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, GBM accounts for approximately 46 percent of the 22,500 new cases of brain cancer diagnosed in the U.S. each year. Treatment options are limited and expected survival is a little over one year. GBM is considered a rare disease by the FDA and the EMA. 
 In 2017, we completed a placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of a combination of CBD and THC in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM. This study, which evaluated a number of safety and exploratory efficacy endpoints, showed that patients with documented recurrent glioblastoma treated with CBD:THC as add-on therapy to dose-intense temozolomide, had an 83 percent one-year survival compared with 44 percent for patients on placebo (plus dose-intense temozolomide) (p=0.042). Preliminary data showed that median survival time for the CBD:THC group was 662 days compared with 369 days in the placebo group. Further follow-up demonstrates continued increased survival in the CBD:THC arm. CBD:THC was generally well tolerated with treatment emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation in two patients in each group. The most common adverse events (three patients or more and greater than placebo) were vomiting, dizziness, nausea, headache, and constipation. 
 We believe that the signals of efficacy demonstrated in this study further reinforce the potential role of cannabinoids in the field of oncology and provides us with the prospect of a new and distinct cannabinoid product candidate in the treatment of additional oncology indications. 
 Our portfolio of intellectual property related to the use of cannabinoids in oncology includes a number of issued patents and pending applications in both the U.S. and Europe. This portfolio is directed to the use of various cannabinoids individually or in combination, in the treatment of a variety of oncology-specific disorders and product formulations. 
 Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (NHIE) 
 NHIE is acute or sub-acute brain injury due to asphyxia caused during birth resulting from deprivation of oxygen, referred to as hypoxia, as a result of a sentinel event such as ruptured placenta, parental shock and even increased heart rate. Hypoxic damage can occur to most of the infant’s organs, but brain damage is the most serious and least likely to heal, resulting in encephalopathy. This can later manifest itself as either mental retardation (including developmental delay and/or intellectual disability) or physical disabilities such as spasticity, blindness and deafness. Spastic diplegia and the other forms of cerebral palsy almost always feature asphyxiation during the birth process as a contributing factor. The exact timing and underlying causes of these outcomes remains unknown but it is widely recognized that interventions need to be administered within six hours of hypoxic insult. 
 According to Kurinczuk. et al. in the 2010 edition of Early Human Development, the incidence of NHIE is 1.5 to 2.8 per 1,000 births in the U.S., or, by our estimate, 6,500 to 12,000 cases per year. Of these, 35 percent are expected to die in early life and 30 percent of cases will result in permanent disability. There are currently no FDA-approved medicines specifically indicated for NHIE. The only FDA-approved treatment is the Olympic Cool-Cap System and treatment guidelines in many European countries also support use of whole-body hypothermia. 
 We held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss the development program for an intravenous CBD formulation in the treatment of NHIE. In April 2015, we received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for CBD for the treatment of NHIE and in July 2015 we received fast track designation. In July 2015 we received Orphan Drug Designation from the EMA for CBD for the treatment of perinatal asphyxia, an alternate term that describes the same condition. A Phase 1 trial of intravenous GWP42003 in healthy volunteers is now complete and we are planning for a Phase 2 trial to commence in 2019.
 Our portfolio of intellectual property related to the use of cannabinoids in NHIE includes a number of issued patents and pending applications in both the U.S. and Europe. This portfolio is directed to the use of cannabidiol in the treatment of NHIE and product formulations.
 Schizophrenia
 
Schizophrenia is a chronic disease that manifests through disturbances of perception, thought, cognition, emotion, motivation and motor activity. Over a lifetime, about 1 percent of the population will develop schizophrenia. All antipsychotic treatments for schizophrenia rely primarily upon their antagonistic action at the dopamine D2 receptor for their antipsychotic effect. They produce a wide range of adverse events and are often poorly tolerated by patients resulting in poor compliance with treatment. Current 
 12

antipsychotics also have little or no effect upon the “negative” symptoms (blunted mood and lack of pleasure, motivation and movement) of schizophrenia or the associated cognitive deficit. Furthermore, the “positive” symptoms (such as hallucinations, delusions and thought disorder) of at least one-third of patients fail to respond adequately to current treatments.
 
GWP42003 features CBD as the primary cannabinoid and has shown notable anti-psychotic effects in accepted pre-clinical models of schizophrenia and importantly has also demonstrated the ability to reduce the characteristic movement disorders induced by currently available anti-psychotic agents. In September 2015, we announced positive top line results from an exploratory Phase 2 placebo-controlled clinical trial of GWP42003 in 88 patients with schizophrenia who had previously failed to respond adequately to first line anti-psychotic medications. Over a series of exploratory endpoints, GWP42003 was consistently superior to placebo, with the most notable differences being in the PANSS positive sub-scale (p=0.019), the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (p=0.04) and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (p=0.018). The safety profile of GWP42003 was reassuring, with no serious adverse events and an overall frequency of adverse events very similar to placebo.
 
We are evaluating appropriate next steps regarding product development in schizophrenia, including a Phase 2b trial.
 
Our portfolio of intellectual property related to the use of cannabinoids in schizophrenia includes a number of issued patents and pending applications in both the U.S. and Europe. This portfolio is directed to the use of various cannabinoids individually or in combination with other cannabinoids or antipsychotic medications in the treatment of schizophrenia or side effects relating to schizophrenia.

Our Proprietary Cannabinoid Product Platform 
 We have established a world-leading position in cannabinoid therapeutics through our proven proprietary cannabinoid product platform. Our platform consists of a continually evolving library of internally generated novel cannabis plant types that produce selected cannabinoids, discovery of novel cannabinoid pharmacology through our network of world leading scientists, a global intellectual property portfolio, in-house formulation, processing and manufacturing capabilities, and development and regulatory expertise. We further believe that we are in a unique position to develop and manufacture plant-derived cannabinoid formulations worldwide at sufficient quality, uniformity, scale and sophistication for the purposes of pharmaceutical development and to meet international regulatory requirements. 
Cannabinoid Science Overview 
 Although one cannabinoid, THC, is known to cause psychoactive effects associated with the use of herbal cannabis, no other cannabinoid is known to share these properties. In recent decades, there have been major scientific advances that have led to the discovery of new plant-derived cannabinoids and the endocannabinoid system. We are at the forefront of this science and our research into a large number of these cannabinoids suggests that each has distinct pharmacological effects. Although more studies are required to establish the clinical significance of these effects, they clearly have the potential to have therapeutic applications. 
 13

Our research to date has focused on the following plant-based cannabinoids: 
 
 
CBD (Cannabidiol) | CBN (Cannabinol) | ​
------------------------------+---------------------------------------+--
CBDV (Cannabidivarin) | CBNV (Cannabinovarin) | ​
CBDA (Cannabidiol — Acid) | D8-THC (Delta-8 Tetrahydrocannabinol) | ​
CBDVA (Cannabidivarin — Acid) | THC (Delta-9 Tetrahydrocannabinol) | ​
CBC (Cannabichromene) | THCA (Tetrahydrocannabinol — Acid) | ​
CBG (Cannabigerol) | THCV (Tetrahydrocannabivarin) | ​
CBGA (Cannabigerol — Acid) | THCVA (Tetrahydrocannabivarin — Acid) | ​
CBGV (Cannabigerovarin) 

 There are at least two types of cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, in the human endocannabinoid system. CB1 receptors are considered to be among the most widely expressed G protein-coupled receptors in the brain and are particularly abundant in areas of the brain concerned with movement and postural control, pain and sensory perception, memory, cognition, emotion, and autonomic and endocrine function. CB1 receptors are also found in peripheral tissues including peripheral nerves and non-neuronal tissues such as muscle, liver tissues and fat. CB2 receptors are expressed primarily in tissues in the immune system and are believed to mediate the immunological effects of cannabinoids. In addition, research suggests the endocannabinoid system interacts with other important neurotransmitter and neuromodulatory systems in the human body, including TRP channels, adenosine uptake and serotonin receptors. The far-reaching and diverse pharmacology of the numerous cannabinoids provides significant potential for development of cannabinoid therapeutics across many indications and disease areas. 
 Our Product Development Approach 
 Our approach to early product development of novel cannabinoids consists of the following stages: 
 Cannabinoid Chemotype Development. Our research activities commence with the generation of novel and proprietary cannabinoid plant types that produce selected cannabinoids. Our plant geneticists breed unique and protected “chemotypes,” or plants characterized by their chemical content, such that we can precisely control the cannabinoid composition of a plant. We employ traditional and molecular methods of plant breeding, with no use of genetic modification. We select chemotypes on the basis of their cannabinoid profile, appropriate levels of concentration and botanical characteristics that enable commercial viability. 
 Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Preparation. After we generate the unique chemotypes, we develop and characterize preparations from an extract of the chemotype. In addition to preparing whole plant extracts, we also modify the extract preparations by adding or removing certain components or purifying preparations to produce a purified cannabinoid. Each of these steps may give rise to patentable opportunities. 
 Pharmacologic Evaluation. We then conduct in vitro and in vivo pharmacologic evaluation studies in validated disease models, testing the potential activity, safety and routes of drug metabolism of each cannabinoid preparation as well as combinations of preparations. These studies seek to identify the pharmacology of cannabinoid preparations and allow us to determine the potential therapeutic area in which they might have promise. We then conduct additional pharmacology, toxicology and pre-clinical development on promising preparations. 
 We conduct most of our pharmacologic evaluations in collaboration with cannabinoid scientists at academic institutions around the world. We enter into research collaboration agreements and other arrangements that enable us to benefit from the expertise of external scientists while retaining intellectual property rights that emerge from the study of our research materials. 
 Product Composition and Formulation Development. In parallel with the later stages of pharmacological evaluation, we identify optimum extraction and processing methods for the most promising preparations and then develop clinical formulations from the plant extract and analytical methodologies to further study the formulations. We are able to develop formulations of potential product candidates that focus on one or more cannabinoids as key active constituents as well as formulations that focus on a single cannabinoid. Each of these steps may give rise to patentable opportunities. 
 With respect to complex extracts, our formulation approach is exemplified by Sativex, the first approved cannabinoid therapeutic based on whole plant extracts from the cannabis plant. The main active ingredients of Sativex, THC and CBD, are extracted from two proprietary chemotypes. In addition to THC and CBD, Sativex contains additional cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid plant components. In order to achieve a fully standardized formulation of these complex extracts, we employ a range of advanced analytical technologies to demonstrate batch-to-batch uniformity. We standardize the formulation across the extracts as a whole, not simply by reference to their key active components. 
 14

With respect to pure cannabinoid formulations, our approach is exemplified by Epidiolex. The active ingredient, CBD, is extracted from proprietary CBD containing chemotypes and then undergoes various processing steps to generate the isolated pure compound. 
 Clinical development. Selected cannabinoid product candidates progress into clinical development. We have an in-house clinical operations team that has the proven capability to execute Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 trials rapidly and cost effectively, and to support regulatory approvals. Since our inception, we have undertaken an extensive program of clinical trials in over 7,000 patients, including over 50 Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials and have undertaken post-market studies involving over 1,000 patients. 
 Manufacturing 
 We are responsible for the manufacture and supply of our products for commercial and clinical purposes. Some of these manufacturing activities are contracted to external third parties. We operate under GMP manufacturing licenses issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, in the U.K. and our facilities have been audited by the MHRA and the FDA. We have extensive in-house experience in production of botanical raw material, pharmaceutical production, quality control, quality assurance and supply chain management. 
 We have successfully exported cannabinoid commercial or research materials to over 30 countries and have the necessary in-house expertise to manage the import/export process worldwide. For Epidiolex, our supply chain partners have obtained the permits and licenses necessary to support importation into the U.S. We have substantial expertise in, and experience with, relevant international, U.S. federal, and U.S. state regulations in relation to the research, distribution and commercialization of cannabinoid therapeutics. We have formed relationships with relevant international, U.S. federal, and U.S. state agencies in order to enable licensing of research sites, establishing appropriate product distribution channels and securing licensed storage, obtaining import/export licenses, and facilitating amendments to relevant legislation if required for commercialization. 
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in significant part on our ability to protect the proprietary elements of Epidiolex, Sativex and our other product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to defend challenges and oppositions from others and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. We have sought, and will continue to seek, patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for our proprietary technologies. Our intellectual property portfolio at September 30, 2018, includes 82 patent families with issued and/or pending claims directed to plants, plant extracts, extraction technology, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery and the therapeutic uses of cannabinoids, as well as plant variety rights, know-how and trade secrets. From these families, as of September 30, 2018, we own and/or license 252 pending patent applications worldwide. Within the U.S., we have 48 issued patents with a further 39 pending patent applications under active prosecution. There are an additional 563 issued patents outside of the U.S. Our policy is to seek patent protection for the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business, but only in those cases where we believe that the costs of obtaining patent protection is justified by the commercial potential of the technology, and typically only in those jurisdictions that we believe present significant commercial opportunities. 
 We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. 
 Our strategy is to seek and obtain patents related to our products across all major pharmaceutical markets around the world. We have a portfolio of intellectual property relating to the use of CBD in various conditions, including epilepsy and schizophrenia; the use of CBDV in various conditions, including ASD and epilepsy; and the use of CBD:THC in glioblastoma. We also hold several patent families covering Sativex.  We anticipate additional patent applications being filed as new data is generated.  
 Under the 2007 research collaboration agreement with Otsuka, which expired in June 2013, all intellectual property (including both patents and non-manufacturing related know-how) that was conceived by either Otsuka or us during the course of the collaboration is jointly owned by Otsuka and us.  We have an exclusive sub-licensable royalty-bearing license to it both outside and within the fields of CNS and oncology.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we have filed, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent. 
 The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for extension, which permits term restoration as compensation for the term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits an extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Extensions cannot extend the remaining term 
 15

of a patent beyond 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug are available in Europe and other non-U.S. jurisdictions; indeed Supplementary Protection Certificates have been applied for such that the European formulation patent for Sativex will be extended to 2025 in Europe. We may apply for extensions on patents covering FDA approval of Epidiolex. 
 To protect our rights to any of our issued patents and proprietary information, we may need to litigate against infringing third parties, avail ourselves of the courts or participate in hearings to determine the scope and validity of those patents or other proprietary rights. 
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information, and it is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. 
 From time to time, in the normal course of our operations, we will be a party to litigation and other dispute matters and claims relating to intellectual property. One of our European patents is currently the subject of appeal proceedings following successfully overcoming the opposition filed against it. Such proceedings may result in claims in these patents being narrowed or cancelled such that the scope of the patent may not be as broad, or the patent may be revoked in its entirety. Our U.S. patent claiming the use of CBD in the treatment of partial seizures is also subject of a petition for inter partes review by the Patents Trial and Appeal Board of the USPTO. A hearing was held in April 2018 and we expect a final decision by January 2019. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and our view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have a materially adverse effect on our operations or our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We are aware of exploratory research into the effects of THC and CBD drug formulations. We are aware of discovery research within the pharmaceutical industry into synthetic agonists and antagonists of CB1 and CB2 receptors. We are also aware of companies that supply synthetic cannabinoids and cannabis extracts to researchers for pre-clinical and clinical investigation. We are also aware of various companies that cultivate cannabis plants with a view to supplying herbal cannabis or nonpharmaceutical cannabis-based formulations to patients. These activities have not been approved by the FDA. 
 Patients in the U.S. suffering from seizures associated with Dravet or LGS are treated with a variety of FDA-approved products, including clobazam, clonazepam, valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, rufinamide, topiramate, ethosuximide, and zonisamide.  In addition, Insys Therapeutics, Inc. has publicly stated its intention to develop CBD for infantile spasms and potentially other orphan indications. Zogenix, Inc. is developing low-dose fenfluramine in Dravet syndrome, for which it has reported positive Phase 3 results and anticipates submitting regulatory applications in the U.S. and Europe. Stiripentol has been approved in Europe for several years to treat Dravet syndrome and was recently approved by the FDA. Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing a topical formulation of CBD, for which it has commenced a pivotal trial in Fragile X syndrome. 
 In both MS spasticity and cancer pain, Sativex aims to treat patients who do not respond adequately to standard care. In MS spasticity, such treatments include baclofen and tizanidine, and in cancer pain such treatments include morphine and other opioids. In cancer pain, the principal focus of ongoing clinical research by our potential competitors is in the development of alternative formulations of opioids. 
 16

With respect to CBD, a number of nonapproved and nonstandardized “artisanal” CBD preparations derived from crude herbal cannabis have been made available in limited quantities by producers of “medical marijuana” in the U.S. We have never endorsed or supported the idea of distributing or legalizing crude herbal cannabis, or preparations derived from crude herbal cannabis, for medical use and do not believe prescription cannabinoids are the same, and therefore competitive with, crude herbal cannabis. We have consistently maintained that only a cannabinoid medication, one that is standardized in composition, formulation and dose, administered by means of an appropriate delivery system, and tested in properly controlled pre-clinical and clinical studies, can meet the standards of regulatory authorities around the world, including those of the FDA. We have also repeatedly stressed that these regulatory processes provide important protections for patients, and we believe that any cannabinoid medication must be subjected to, and satisfy, such rigorous scrutiny.
 Transition to U.S. Domestic Filer Reporting
 We determined that, as of March 31, 2018, we no longer qualified as a ‘‘foreign private issuer’’ under the rules and regulations of the SEC. While we were a foreign private issuer, we were exempt from compliance with certain laws and regulations of the SEC, and certain Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) regulations, including the proxy rules, the short-swing profits recapture rules and certain governance requirements, such as independent director oversight of the nomination of directors and executive compensation. In addition, we were not required to file annual, quarterly and current reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies registered under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‘‘Exchange Act’’). As a result of this determination, beginning on October 1, 2018, we are no longer entitled to ‘‘foreign private issuer’’ exemptions and we plan to report as a domestic U.S. filer, including filing quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and proxy statements under Section 14 of the Exchange Act. In addition, commencing on October 1, 2018, we now prepare our financial statements in U.S. dollars in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States rather than International Financial Reporting Standards. In addition, since October 1, 2018, our ‘‘insiders’’ are now subject to the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act and will be no longer exempt from the requirements of Regulation FD promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act. Moreover, as a domestic filer, we are no longer permitted to follow our home country rules in lieu of the corporate governance obligations imposed by Nasdaq, and are required to comply with the governance practices required of U.S. domestic issuers.
 
In connection with our loss of foreign private issuer status, we made amendments to our Articles of Association, which were approved at the Company’s Annual General Meeting held on March 14, 2018 to comply with Nasdaq listing requirements for domestic companies on quorum requirements. These amendments now provide that a quorum will be present for a general meeting where (i) there are two persons present and entitled to vote upon the business to be transacted, each being either a shareholder or a proxy for a shareholder or a duly authorized representative of a corporation that is a shareholder, and (ii) such two persons together hold (or are the representative or proxy of members in relation to the meeting holding) at least one-third in number of the issued shares entitled to vote on the business to be transacted. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approvals
 FDA Approval Process 
 In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as imposition of clinical holds, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 
 Pharmaceutical product development in the U.S. typically involves pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests and the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence. For commercial approval, the sponsor must submit adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show that the drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling. The sponsor must also submit substantial evidence, generally consisting of adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to establish that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling. In certain cases, the FDA may determine that a drug is effective based on one clinical study plus confirmatory evidence. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 
 Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including the FDA’s good laboratory practices regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) regulations implementing the Animal Welfare Act. The results of pre-clinical testing are submitted to the 
 17

FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term pre-clinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not imposed a clinical hold on the IND or otherwise commented or questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations, (ii) in compliance with GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors, and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions. 
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In general in Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. The FDA may, however, determine that a drug is effective based on one clinical study plus confirmatory evidence. Only a small percentage of investigational drugs complete all three phases and obtain marketing approval. In some cases, the FDA may require post-market studies, known as Phase 4 studies, to be conducted as a condition of approval in order to gather additional information on the drug’s effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. Depending on the risks posed by the drugs, other post-market requirements may be imposed. 
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. The FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all pre-clinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, for fiscal year 2018 $2,421,495, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program fees, for fiscal year 2018 $304,162. 
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the statute and implementing regulations, the FDA has 180 days (the initial review cycle) from the date of filing to issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter, unless the review period is adjusted by mutual agreement between the FDA and the applicant or as a result of the applicant submitting a major amendment. In practice, the performance goals established pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act have effectively extended the initial review cycle beyond 180 days. The FDA’s current performance goals call for the FDA to complete review of 90 percent of standard (non-priority) NDAs within 10 months of receipt and within six months for priority NDAs, but two additional months are added to standard and priority NDAs for a new molecular entity (NME). 
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current GMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. 
 18

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing 90 percent of resubmissions within two to six months depending on the type of information included. 
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Under a new rule, effective January 18, 2017, sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of these trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed for up to two years if the sponsor certifies that it is seeking approval of an unapproved product or that it will file an application for approval of a new indication for an approved product within one year. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs. 
Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval 
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track Program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. 
 Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. Unless otherwise informed by the FDA, for an accelerated approval product an applicant must submit to the FDA for consideration during the preapproval review period copies of all promotional materials, including promotional labeling as well as advertisements, intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval. After 120 days following marketing approval, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the applicant must submit promotional materials at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination of the labeling or initial publication of the advertisement 
 In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

The Hatch-Waxman Act 
 Orange Book Listing 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are considered to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug, are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug in accordance with state law. 
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement, certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use, rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. 
 If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 
 Exclusivity 
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which time the FDA cannot receive any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking approval of a drug that references a version of the NCE drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that includes the change. 
 An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification and thus no ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. 
 For a botanical drug, the FDA may determine that the active moiety is one or more of the principal components or the complex mixture as a whole. This determination would affect the utility of any five-year exclusivity as well as the ability of any potential generic competitor to demonstrate that it is the same drug as the original botanical drug. 
 Five-year and three-year exclusivities do not preclude FDA approval of a 505(b)(1) application for a duplicate version of the drug during the period of exclusivity, provided that the 505(b)(1) applicant conducts or obtains a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Patent Term Extension 
 After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase — the time between IND submission and NDA submission — and all of the review phase — the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the 
 20

FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years. 
 For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the PTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted. 
 Orphan Drugs 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition — generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S (or affects more than 200,000 in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. of such drug). Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. If the FDA designates an orphan drug based on a finding of clinical superiority, the FDA must provide a written notification to the sponsor that states the basis for orphan designation, including “any plausible hypothesis” relied upon by the FDA. The FDA must also publish a summary of its clinical superiority findings upon granting orphan drug exclusivity based on clinical superiority. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. 
Special Protocol Assessment 
 A company may reach an agreement with the FDA under the Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, process as to the required design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. According to its performance goals, the FDA is supposed to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the administrative record. Under the FDC Act and FDA guidance implementing the statutory requirement, an SPA is generally binding upon the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy after the study begins, public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, the sponsor and the FDA agree to the change in writing, or if the study sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. 
Advertising and Promotion 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs. 
 Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 
 Adverse Event Reporting and GMP Compliance 
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, may require under a REMS special communication regarding the safety of the drug or heightened surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to GMP, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with GMP. 
 21

Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with GMP. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use 
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month period of exclusivity attached to any other exclusivity listed with the FDA — patent or non-patent — for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for pediatric exclusivity include a determination by the FDA that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population; a written request by the FDA for pediatric studies; and agreement by the applicant to perform the requested studies and the submission to the FDA, completion of the studies in accordance with the written request, and the acceptance by the FDA, of the reports of the requested studies within the statutory time frame. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective, unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver from the FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data need to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. Under PREA, the FDA must send a noncompliance letter requesting a response within 45 days to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 
 Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Priority Review Voucher Program 
 We were awarded a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) as part of the FDA approval for Epidiolex. Rare pediatric disease designation is granted to drugs and biologics intended to treat orphan diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S., primarily age 18 years or younger. Under the FDA’s Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, a sponsor that receives approval for an NDA or BLA for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible to receive a voucher for a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The PRV may be used by the sponsor or sold or transferred. The voucher relates to only the timing and action of application review and does not guarantee approval of the application. 
Controlled Substances 
 The federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and its implementing regulations establish a “closed system” of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA is the federal agency responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce. 
 The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedules — Schedule I, II, III, IV or V — with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the U.S. and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Pharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use that are otherwise approved for marketing may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence, and Schedule V substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence. Epidiolex is a Schedule V controlled substance. Sativex, if approved in the U.S., will require scheduling by the DEA before it can be marketed 
 Facilities that manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity(ies) and controlled substance schedule(s). For example, separate registrations are required for importation and manufacturing activities, and each registration authorizes which schedules of controlled substances the registrant may handle. However, certain coincident activities are permitted without obtaining a separate DEA registration, such as distribution of controlled substances by the manufacturer that produces them. 
 The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled 
 22

substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. An application for a manufacturing registration as a bulk manufacturer (not a dosage form manufacturer or a repacker/relabeler) for a Schedule I or II substance must be published in the Federal Register, and is open for 60 days to permit interested persons to submit comments, objections or requests for a hearing. A copy of the notice of the Federal Register publication is simultaneously forwarded by DEA to all those registered, or applicants for registration, as bulk manufacturers of that substance. Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances, and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses, and must obtain authorization to destroy or dispose of controlled substances. As with applications for registration as a bulk manufacturer, an application for an importer registration for a Schedule I or II substance must also be published in the Federal Register, which remains open for 30 days for comments. Imports of Schedule I and II controlled substances for commercial purposes are generally restricted to substances not already available from a domestic supplier or where there is not adequate competition among domestic suppliers. In addition to an importer or exporter registration, importers and exporters must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedule I and II substance or Schedule III, IV and V narcotic, and submit import or export declarations for Schedule III, IV and V non-narcotics. In some cases, Schedule III non-narcotic substances may be subject to the import/export permit requirement, if necessary to ensure that the U.S. complies with its obligations under international drug control treaties. 
 For drugs manufactured in the U.S., the DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for the amount of substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced in the U.S. based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific, research and industrial needs. This limited aggregate amount of cannabis that the DEA allows to be produced in the U.S. each year is allocated among individual companies, which, in turn, must annually apply to the DEA for individual manufacturing and procurement quotas. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas a few times per year, and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments for individual companies. 
 The states also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State Authorities, including Boards of Pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution. 
 Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are and will be subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved. 
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. 
 In the European Union., medicinal products are subject to extensive pre- and post-marketing regulation by regulatory authorities at both the European Union and national levels. Additional rules also apply at the national level to the manufacture, import, export, storage, distribution and sale of controlled substances. In many European Union. member states the regulatory authority responsible for medicinal products is also responsible for controlled substances. Responsibility is, however, split in some member states, such as the U.K. Generally, any company manufacturing or distributing a medicinal product containing a controlled substance in the European Union will need to hold a controlled substances license from the competent national authority and will be subject to specific record-keeping and security obligations. Separate import or export certificates are required for each shipment into or out of the member state. 
 Clinical Trials and Marketing Approval 
 Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements and a company has received favorable ethics committee approval, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country, even though there is already some degree of legal harmonization in the European Union member states 
 23

resulting from the national implementation of underlying European Union legislation. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements. 
 To obtain regulatory approval to place a drug on the market in the European Union, we must submit a marketing authorization application. This application is similar to the NDA in the U.S., with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. All application procedures require an application in the common technical document, or CTD, format, which includes the submission of detailed information about the manufacturing and quality of the product, and nonclinical and clinical trial information. Drugs can be authorized in the European Union by using (i) the centralized authorization procedure, (ii) the mutual recognition procedure, (iii) the decentralized procedure or (iv) national authorization procedures. The initial Sativex approvals were a consequence of an application under the De-Centralized Procedure, or DCP, to the E.U. member states of the U.K. and Spain. 
 The European Commission created the centralized procedure for the approval of human drugs to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Union and, by extension (after national implementing decisions) in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which, together with the European Union. member states, comprise the European Economic Area, or EEA. Applicants file marketing authorization applications with the EMA, where they are reviewed by a relevant scientific committee, in most cases the CHMP. The EMA forwards CHMP opinions to the European Commission, which uses them as the basis for deciding whether to grant a marketing authorization. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission that is valid across the European Union, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially designated “orphan drugs” (drugs used for rare human diseases) and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the voluntary request of the applicant also be used for human drugs that do not fall within the above-mentioned categories if the CHMP agrees that the human drug (a) contains a new active substance not yet approved on November 20, 2005; (b) constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or (c) authorization under the centralized procedure is in the interests of patients at the European Union level. 
 Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum time frame for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application by the EMA is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP), with adoption of the actual marketing authorization by the European Commission thereafter. 
 Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest from the point of view of therapeutic innovation, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease to be treated; the absence of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach, and anticipation of exceptional high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the evaluation for the opinion of the CHMP is completed within 150 days and the opinion issued thereafter. 
 For those medicinal products for which the centralized procedure is not available, the applicant must submit marketing authorization applications to the national medicines regulators through one of three procedures: (i) the mutual recognition procedure (which must be used if the product has already been authorized in at least one other European Union member state, and in which the European Union member states are required to grant an authorization recognizing the existing authorization in the other European Union member state, unless they identify a serious risk to public health), (ii) the decentralized procedure (in which applications are submitted simultaneously in two or more European Union member states) or (iii) national authorization procedures (which results in a marketing authorization in a single European Union member state). 
 Mutual Recognition Procedure 
 The mutual recognition procedure, or MRP, for the approval of human drugs is an alternative approach to facilitate individual national marketing authorizations within the European Union. Basically, the MRP may be applied for all human drugs for which the centralized procedure is not obligatory. The MRP is applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products, and must be used if the product has already been authorized in one or more member states. Since the first approvals for Sativex were national approvals in the U.K. and Spain (following a DCP), the only route open to us for additional marketing authorizations in the European Union was the MRP. 
 The characteristic of the MRP is that the procedure builds on an already-existing marketing authorization in a member state of the European Union that is used as a reference in order to obtain marketing authorizations in other European Union member states. In the MRP, a marketing authorization for a drug already exists in one or more member states of the European Union and subsequently marketing authorization applications are made in other European Union member states by referring to the initial marketing authorization. The member state in which the marketing authorization was first granted will then act as the reference 
 24

member state. The member states where the marketing authorization is subsequently applied for act as concerned member states. The concerned member states are required to grant an authorization recognizing the existing authorization in the reference member state, unless they identify a serious risk to public health. 
 The MRP is based on the principle of the mutual recognition by European Union member states of their respective national marketing authorizations. Based on a marketing authorization in the reference member state, the applicant may apply for marketing authorizations in other member states. In such case, the reference member state shall update its existing assessment report about the drug in 90 days. After the assessment is completed, copies of the report are sent to all member states, together with the approved summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. The concerned member states then have 90 days to recognize the decision of the reference member state and the summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. National marketing authorizations shall be granted within 30 days after acknowledgement of the agreement. 
 Should any Member State refuse to recognize the marketing authorization by the reference member state, on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the issue will be referred to a coordination group. Within a time frame of 60 days, member states shall, within the coordination group, make all efforts to reach a consensus. If this fails, the procedure is submitted to an EMA scientific committee for arbitration. The opinion of this EMA Committee is then forwarded to the European Commission, for the start of the decision-making process. As in the centralized procedure, this process entails consulting various European Commission Directorates General and the Standing Committee on Human Medicinal Products. Since the initial approvals of Sativex in the U.K. and Spain, there have been three “waves” of additional approvals under three separate MRPs. Each of these procedures have been completed without any referral, and therefore without any delay.
 Data Exclusivity 
 In the European Union, marketing authorization applications for generic medicinal products do not need to include the results of pre-clinical and clinical trials, but instead can refer to the data included in the marketing authorization of a reference product for which regulatory data exclusivity has expired. If a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic marketing authorization applications referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic products may not be placed on the market. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. 
Orphan Medicinal Products 
 The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, may recommend orphan medicinal product designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the product in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. The COMP may only recommend orphan medicinal product designation when the product in question offers a significant clinical benefit over existing approved products for the relevant indication. Following a positive opinion by the COMP, the European Commission adopts a decision granting orphan status. The COMP will reassess orphan status in parallel with EMA review of a marketing authorization application and orphan status may be withdrawn at that stage if it no longer fulfills the orphan criteria (for instance because in the meantime a new product was approved for the indication and no convincing data are available to demonstrate a significant benefit over that product). Orphan medicinal product designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing authorization. During this period, the competent authorities may not accept or approve any similar medicinal product, unless it offers a significant clinical benefit. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan medicinal product designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
Pediatric Development 
 In the European Union, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree to a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, with the EMA and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP unless a waiver applies, for example, because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults. The marketing authorization application for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Products that are granted a marketing authorization on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if the product covered by it qualifies for one at the time of approval). This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted. 
 25

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 In addition, most countries are parties to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, which governs international trade and domestic control of narcotic substances, including cannabis extracts. Countries may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to our obtaining marketing approval for Sativex and our other products in those countries. These countries may not be willing or able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations to permit Sativex or our other products to be marketed, or achieving such amendments to the laws and regulations may take a prolonged period of time. In that case, we would be unable to market our products in those countries in the near future or perhaps at all. 
 Reimbursement 
 Sales of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, and commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, utilization management and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D is available through both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from nongovernmental payers. 
 On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This law provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. This research is overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures must be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear how such a result could be avoided and what if any effect the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payer to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of the product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA) was enacted in March 2010. The ACA was enacted with the goal of expanding coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall health care costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare D program. We still cannot fully predict the impact of the ACA on pharmaceutical companies as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet been completed, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has publicly announced that it is analyzing the ACA regulations and policies that have been issued to determine if changes should be made. In addition, although the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of most of the ACA, some states have stated their intentions to not implement certain sections of the ACA and

some members of Congress are still working to repeal the ACA. These challenges add to the uncertainty of the changes enacted as part of the ACA. In addition, the current legal challenges to the ACA, as well as Congressional efforts to repeal the ACA, add to the uncertainty of the legislative changes enacted as part of the ACA. 
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, some European Union jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. Such differences in national pricing regimes may create price differentials between European Union member states. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. In the European Union, the downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become intense. As a result, barriers to entry of new products are becoming increasingly high and patients are unlikely to use a drug product that is not reimbursed by their government. 
 Other Health Care Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In the U.S., our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or VHCA, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule, additional laws and requirements apply. Under the VHCA, drug companies are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs and U.S. Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service-designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, discounted prices must be offered for certain U.S. Department of Defense purchases for its TRICARE program via a rebate system. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. 
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state, even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales and marketing activities or register their sales representatives. Other legislation has been enacted in certain states prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 Legal Proceedings and Related Matters 
 From time to time, we may be a party to litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. We do not have any pending litigation that, separately or in the aggregate, would, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
