Item 1.  Business
Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, acquiring, developing and potentially commercializing innovative oncology therapeutics that target difficult to treat cancers. Our clinical pipeline includes: SL-401, SL-801, and SL-701.
 
SL-401 pivotal data; plans for registration and potential commercialization: SL-401 has completed a pivotal trial in patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, or BPDCN, and has successfully met the primary endpoint of the trial. SL-401 is a targeted therapy directed to the interleukin-3 receptor-a, or CD123. SL-401 was granted breakthrough therapy designation, or BTD, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of patients with BPDCN. Based on the trial results and other data, we expect to complete submission of a rolling Biologics License Application, or BLA, with the FDA in the first half of 2018. If successful, SL-401 would be the first drug ever approved for this indication, and pre-launch activities are underway in preparation for this potential outcome.
 
SL-401 additional clinical activities: SL-401 is also being assessed in additional indications, including in Phase 1/2 clinical trials of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML, myelofibrosis, or MF, acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and multiple myeloma. Preliminary data from some of these programs were presented at the 2017 American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting and Exposition, and further updates are expected this year.
 
Additional clinical-stage candidates: SL-801 is a novel, oral, small molecule, reversible inhibitor of Exportin-1, or XPO1, a nuclear transport protein involved in a variety of cancers. SL-801 is being assessed in a Phase 1 dose escalation trial of patients with advanced solid tumors. Preliminary data were presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology, or ESMO, Annual Congress 2017, and further updates are expected this year as dose escalation continues. SL-701, an immunotherapeutic, has completed a Phase 2 trial of patients with relapsed/refractory glioblastoma, or GBM. Data were presented at the 2017 Society for Neuro-Oncology, or SNO, meeting, and further updates are expected this year.

SL-401
 
Overview
 
SL-401 is a novel targeted therapy directed to the interleukin-3 receptor-a, or CD123, a target present on a wide range of malignancies. SL-401 was granted breakthrough therapy designation, or BTD, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, or BPDCN. SL-401 has completed a pivotal Phase 2 trial in patients with BPDCN and has met the primary endpoint of the trial. Based on these and other data, we expect to complete submission of a rolling Biologics License Application, or BLA, with the FDA in the first half of 2018. If successful, SL-401 would be the first drug ever approved for this indication. Pre-launch activities are underway in preparation for this potential outcome.
 
In parallel, we are also conducting additional development activities. SL-401 is being assessed in Phase 1/2 clinical trials of other indications including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML, and myelofibrosis, or MF, acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and multiple myeloma. Preliminary data from some of these programs were presented at the 2017 American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting and Exposition, and further updates are expected this year. Factors that may impact next steps for SL-401 in these additional indications include enrollment trends, adverse events, safety and efficacy results, regulatory paths, commercial landscape, and other medical, business, and practical considerations.
 
SL-401 design and mechanism of action
 
SL-401 is a novel targeted therapy directed to the IL-3R (CD123). SL-401 is comprised of human IL-3 recombinantly fused to a truncated diphtheria toxin, or DT, payload engineered such that IL-3 replaces the native DT receptor-binding domain. In this way, the IL-3 domain of SL-401 directs the cytotoxic DT payload to cells expressing CD123. Upon internalization, SL-401 irreversibly inhibits protein synthesis and induces apoptosis of the target cell. Given this novel mechanism of action, there is a potential to develop SL-401 as a single agent and in combination with other therapies.
 
CD123 is normally expressed on certain maturing hematopoietic cells, including maturing myeloid cells, B cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, or pDCs, mast cells, basophils and eosinophils, and appears to be involved in cell maturation, differentiation, and survival. CD123 does not appear to be expressed to a significant degree on normal hematopoietic stem cells.
 
CD123 is expressed on multiple malignancies including BPDCN, AML, certain myeloproliferative neoplasms, or MPNs, myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, chronic myeloid leukemia, or CML, B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia, or B-ALL, hairy cell leukemia, Hodgkins and certain non-Hodgkins lymphomas. In addition to expression on tumor bulk, CD123 expression has been reported on the cancer stem cells, or CSCs, of certain hematologic cancers including AML, CML, MDS, and potentially T-cell ALL. In addition, elevated CD123 expression has been correlated with poor prognosis in certain hematologic cancers (Vergez in Haematologica, 2011, Testa in Biomarker Research, 2014).
 
Notably, CD123+ pDCs, which are the cell of origin for BPDCN, have also been reported in the microenvironment of certain tumors including multiple myeloma, CMML and other MPNs, and some solid tumors where they could play a tumor-promoting role (and preclinically, have been shown to be tumor-promoting in myeloma). CD123+ pDCs have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases, including scleroderma and cutaneous lupus, and is a potential therapeutic target for these conditions.
 
SL-401 preclinical activity
 
SL-401 has demonstrated preclinical in vitro and in vivo activity against a wide range of hematologic cancer types. In AML, SL-401 is highly active against both leukemia blasts (i.e., tumor bulk) and CSCs of a variety of human leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia cells from patients. In particular, SL-401 demonstrated potent cytotoxicity against leukemic cells in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion with concentrations that inhibit the growth of fifty percent (50%) of cells, or an IC50, in the low picomolar range. Notably, normal bone marrow stem cells were relatively insensitive to SL-401. SL-401 also exhibited anti-CSC activity. In particular, SL-401 inhibited AML colony formation, an assay for stem cell activity, compared with normal human bone marrow. As further validation of an anti-CSC effect, SL-401 reduced the incorporation and growth (i.e., tumorigenicity) of AML cells, relative to normal human bone marrow, when treated ex vivo and reimplanted into immunodeficient mice indicating activity at the level of the CSC. In addition, SL-401 prolonged the survival of mice implanted with human leukemia xenografts compared with untreated mice.
 
In addition, SL-401 demonstrated high potency against BPDCN cells from patients, with an IC50 in the femtomolar (10-15 molar) range. SL-401 has also demonstrated preclinical activity against additional CD123+ malignancies including chronic eosinophilic

leukemia, where it produced IC50 values in the low single-digit picomolar (10-12 molar) range. SL-401 has also shown potent in vitro anti-leukemia activity against CML tumor bulk and CML CSCs, and increased survival in mouse models of human CML taken from patients who were resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs. SL-401 has also been shown to possess a synergistic anti-CML effect when used in combination with certain TKIs. SL-401 has also demonstrated in vitro anti-tumor activity against several lymphoid cancer types, including lymphoid leukemia (e.g., T cell acute lymphoid leukemia, or T-ALL), Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and multiple myeloma, or MM. SL-401 appears to have both a direct as well as an indirect anti-MM effect, the latter seemingly caused by SL-401s ability to target IL-3R+ hyperproliferative plasmacytoid dendritic cells, or pDC, (the cell of origin of BPDCN) that may provide a novel immune-associated growth stimulus to their neighboring MM cells. This is notable for several reasons including the drugs novel mechanism of anti-MM action as well as linking MM and BPDCN via a common cell type (pDC), and the CD123 target. SL-401 has also been shown to have a synergistic effect against MM in preclinical systems when combined with existing therapies including pomalidomide (Pomalyst®), lenalidomide (Revlimid®) and bortezomib (Velcade®). Neighboring pDCs have been reported in the microenvironment of additional tumor types including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML.
 
Phase 1/2 clinical trial of SL-401 in BPDCN
 
SL-401 was initially evaluated in an investigator sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced hematologic cancers; a trial which has since completed. In this trial, SL-401 administered intravenously over a single, five-day cycle demonstrated anti-tumor activity, including complete responses, or CRs, largely in BPDCN, but also in relapsed/refractory, or r/r, AML with common adverse reactions being transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, fever and chills, and capillary leak syndrome (Frankel et al. Blood 124, 2014; ASH 2013 Poster #2682; ASCO 2013 Poster #7029; ASH 2015 Poster #3795). We then conducted a corporate-sponsored pivotal trial of SL-401 in BPDCN.
 
Pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial of SL-401 in BPDCN
 
On October 31, 2017, we announced that the pivotal Phase 2 trial of SL-401 in BPDCN met its primary endpoint.
 
The pivotal Phase 2 trial of SL-401 in BPDCN was a multicenter, open label, non-randomized, single arm clinical trial. We believe this trial is the largest multicenter prospective study ever conducted in BPDCN. The trial enrolled 45 BPDCN (32 first-line, 13 relapsed/refractory) patients at 7 sites in the U.S. Patients received SL-401 dosed intravenously on days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle for multiple consecutive cycles. The trial consisted of 3 Stages: Stage 1 (lead-in, dose escalation), Stage 2 (expansion), and Stage 3 (pivotal, confirmatory). To ensure ongoing patient access to SL-401, we are currently enrolling both first-line and relapsed/refractory BPDCN patients in an additional cohort, Stage 4.
 
In December 2017, we presented detailed data from the pivotal trial at the 2017 American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting and Exposition, in Atlanta, GA. Based on results from Stage 1, which included patients with BPDCN or acute myeloid leukemia, SL-401 dosed at 12 mcg/kg/day was selected for use in subsequent Stages for BPDCN. The most common treatment-related adverse events, or TRAEs, with SL-401 at 12 mcg/kg/day in BPDCN (Stages 1, 2, and 3) (n=42) were alanine aminotransferase increase (52%), aspartate aminotransferase increase (50%), hypoalbuminemia (50%), and thrombocytopenia (38%). TRAEs included capillary leak syndrome, or CLS, (19%), which was grade 5 in 2.4% (1/42) of BPDCN patients at 12 mcg/kg/day, 2.0% (3/153) of all patients across all trial indications at all doses, and 0.8% (1/119) of patients across all trial indications at 12 mcg/kg/day. After the ASH presentation, and as reflected here, we obtained additional information that led to one fewer grade 5 CLS event than previously reported at ASH. In first-line BPDCN patients who received SL-401 at 12 mcg/kg/day, the overall response rate, or ORR, was 90% (26/29) with a 72% (21/29) rate of CR + CRc + CRi (CR = complete response; CRc = clinical complete response: absence of gross disease with minimal residual skin abnormality; CRi = CR with incomplete hematologic recovery) by investigator assessment. 45% (13/29) of these patients were bridged to stem cell transplant, or SCT, following remission on SL-401. In relapsed/refractory BPDCN patients (all of whom received SL-401 at 12 mcg/kg/day in Stages 1 and 2; n=13), there was a 69% (9/13) ORR and a 38% (5/13) CR + CRc + CRi rate.
 
Stage 3 of the Phase 2 trial was designed to provide the pivotal, confirmatory evidence of efficacy of SL-401 in BPDCN. In Stage 3, 13 first-line BPDCN patients were enrolled and received SL-401 at 12 mcg/kg/day. Stage 3 met its primary endpoint, with a CR + CRc rate of 54% (7/13) (95% Confidence Interval: 25.1, 80.8) by investigator assessment. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the primary endpoint exceeded the pre-specified 10% rate. ORR was 77% (10/13). 46% (6/13) of patients were bridged to SCT following remission on SL-401. 86% (6/7) of complete responders were relapse-free at 5+ to 8+ months, ongoing as of the presentation.

Regulatory, biologics license application (BLA), and potential commercialization of SL-401 in BPDCN
 
SL-401 was granted breakthrough therapy designation, or BTD, by the FDA in August 2016. SL-401 was also awarded Orphan Drug status by the FDA for the treatment of AML in February 2011 and for BPDCN in June 2013. The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, awarded Orphan Drug status to SL-401 for the treatment of AML in September 2015 and for BPDCN in November 2015.
 
We believe that the results of this pivotal trial of SL-401 in BPDCN could support marketing approval, and we plan to include such results as part of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, that seeks U.S. marketing approval. We are pursuing a rolling BLA submission and believe that such a submission could be completed in the first half of 2018. If successful, we project marketing approval could be attained in the second half of 2018, or soon thereafter. Later this year, we anticipate feedback from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, regarding a potential regulatory filing.
 
Stemlines commercial group continues to build out its infrastructure and optimize launch readiness within the BPDCN market. The organization is focused on preparing the market, the product, and the organization for the successful launch of SL-401 should it be approved. In December 2017, we launched our BPDCN disease awareness campaign at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting. One of the campaigns primary goals is to try to ensure that multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, including hematologist-oncologists, dermatologists, pathologists, and allied healthcare professionals are appropriately testing for CD123 to bring the diagnosis of BPDCN to the forefront and to limit misdiagnoses and underdiagnoses. The campaign highlights the importance of CD123 as a key diagnostic marker for correct patient diagnosis. Access to SL-401, should it be approved, remains a top priority within our managed care group with key success criteria identified as removing hurdles to product access and reimbursement. We are setting up a formal patient assistance program and 501(c)(3) foundation support for those that require assistance. Marketing, sales and medical affairs efforts are focused on scaling up to a right size staffing model with continued refinement to launch strategies and tactics for launch effectiveness.
 
SL-401 Clinical Trials in Additional Indications
 
Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML, and Myelofibrosis, or MF
 
SL-401 is being assessed in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in advanced myeloproliferative neoplasms, or MPN, focused on chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML, and myelofibrosis, or MF. This trial consists of a lead-in, dose escalation stage, 3x3 design (Stage 1) in which patients receive SL-401 as a daily intravenous infusion at 7, 9, or 12 mcg/kg/day for days 1-3 of a 21-day cycle. Stage 1 was followed by an expansion stage (Stage 2) enrolling MPN patients at the dose (12 mcg/kg/day) determined by Stage 1.
 
As reported at the 2017 ASH annual meeting in December 2017, 24 patients with advanced MPN (11 relapsed/refractory CMML; 12 relapsed/refractory MF) received SL-401 in Stages 1 and 2. In Stage 1, 12 mcg/kg/day was the highest tested dose for MPN, and a maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, was not reached. Stage 1 (n=9 patients) completed enrollment, and Stage 2 (n=15 patients) is ongoing. Median age was 69 years (range: 43-81); 54% were male. 71% (17/24) of patients had splenomegaly by physical examination. In Stage 1, no dose limiting toxicities, or DLT, were identified and a MTD was not reached. In Stages 1 and 2, the most common treatment-related adverse events, or TRAEs, included hypoalbuminemia (33%), thrombocytopenia (33%), and fatigue (29%). Most common TRAEs (grade 3 or higher), include thrombocytopenia (24%) and anemia (19%). Capillary leak was reported in 24% (5/21) evaluable patients: 4 cases were grades 1-2 and 1 case was grade 3.
 
In relapsed/refractory CMML, 71% (5/7) of patients with baseline splenomegaly had a >50% reduction in spleen size by physical examination. One relapsed/refractory CMML patient had a CR (14+ months on treatment) comprised of a bone marrow CR, or BMCR, and a 100% spleen reduction (5 to 0 cm, or not palpable).
 
In relapsed/refractory MF, 50% (5/10) of patients with baseline splenomegaly had spleen reductions of >25% (range: 29-100%) by physical exam, including 3 patients (30%) with spleen reductions >35%. Notably, 2 out of 3 patients had baseline thrombocytopenia: 1 patient with platelets <100K/microliter and 1 patient with platelets <50K/microliter.
 
We continue patient enrollment and follow-up in the trial. Based on the results to date, we believe SL-401s favorable tolerability and preliminary signs of activity support continued development and evaluation of possible registration-directed trial designs. Updates relating to this trial are expected later this year, including decisions regarding next steps for SL-401 in one or more of these indications. Factors that may impact next steps include enrollment trends, overall safety and efficacy results, regulatory paths, commercial landscape, and other medical, business, and practical considerations.
 
AML in complete remission with minimal residual disease, or MRD
 
SL-401 is being assessed in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in AML in complete remission with minimal residual disease, or MRD. This trial consists of a lead-in, dose escalation stage, 3x3 design (Stage 1) in which patients received SL-401 as a daily intravenous infusion at
 
8




7, 9, or 12 mcg/kg/day for days 1-5 of a 21 or 28-day cycle. Stage 1 was followed by an expansion stage (Stage 2) enrolling AML patients in complete remission with MRD at the dose (12 mcg/kg/day) determined in Stage 1.
 
As reported at the 2017 ASH annual meeting in December 2017, 16 AML patients in complete remission with high risk of relapse including MRD received SL-401 in Stages 1 and 2, including 14 patients in first CR and two patients in second CR. In Stage 1, 12 mcg/kg/day was the highest tested dose for this trial; a maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, was not reached. Stage 1 (n=9 patients) has completed enrollment and enrollment in Stage 2 with SL-401 at 12 mcg/kg/day is ongoing. No DLTs or MTD were identified in Stage 1. The most common TRAEs in Stages 1 and 2 include hypoalbuminemia (44%), ALT increase (38%), AST increase (38%), and thrombocytopenia (38%). The most common TRAEs, grade 3 or higher, included ALT increase (31%), AST increase (25%), and thrombocytopenia (19%). Five patients were relapse-free for over 5 months (range 5+ to 14+), including 1 patient who went to stem cell transplant, or SCT, after 3+ months on SL-401, 2 patients (8+ and 14+ months on SL-401) following allogeneic SCT.
 
We continue patient enrollment and follow-up in the trial, including for MRD alterations and response duration. Given preclinical data indicating potential synergies between SL-401 and azacitidine in AML and high-risk MDS, and the ongoing clinical trial assessing the combination of SL-401 and azacitidine in AML, we are also considering a transition to combination therapy in this indication. Further updates are expected later this year. Factors that may impact next steps include enrollment trends, overall safety and efficacy results, regulatory paths, commercial landscape, and other medical, business, and practical considerations.
 
Multiple myeloma
 
SL-401, in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, is being assessed in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. In previous studies, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, or pDCs, the cells which when malignant become BPDCN, were found to be present in the bone marrow microenvironment of patients with multiple myeloma (Chauhan in Cancer Cell, 2009). These CD123+ pDCs were also found to possess growth-promoting interactions with their neighboring myeloma cells, as well as additional interactions with immune effector T cells and natural killer, or NK, cells in the myeloma bone marrow milieu (Ray in Leukemia, 2015). In preclinical studies, SL-401 has been shown to possess an anti-myeloma effect both directly against myeloma cells as well as indirectly via inhibition of surrounding pDCs, a potentially novel immune-associated mechanism (Chauhan in Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2013; Chauhan in Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2014; Chauhan et al. Blood 2015). SL-401 has also demonstrated synergy with several standard anti-myeloma agents, including pomalidomide, in preclinical studies of myeloma (Ray in Blood, 2014). This trial has a lead-in dose escalation stage (Stage 1) and an expansion stage (Stage 2) designed to enroll patients at the dose and regimen determined by Stage 1. The main objectives of the clinical study are to determine safety, potential signals of anti-pDC activity, and potential signals of clinical activity with SL-401 in combination with other agents. The trial is currently open to enroll patients in Stage 1, and we plan to consider the information from this trial, moving forward, to inform key elements of a combination regimen to align administration schedules with available agents. We believe that this potential anti-pDC mechanism may have ramifications not only relating to myeloma but also other indications including certain MPNs as well as some solid tumors and autoimmune diseases.
 
Updates relating to this trial are expected later this year, including decisions regarding next steps for SL-401 in this indication. Factors that may impact next steps include enrollment trends, overall safety and efficacy results, regulatory paths, commercial landscape, and other medical, business, and practical considerations.
 
Potential SL-401 Indications
 
Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN)
 
BPDCN is an aggressive hematologic cancer that carries a poor prognosis. BPDCN had been previously classified as blastic NK cell lymphoma, agranular CD4+/CD56+ hematodermic neoplasm, and plasmacytoid dendritic cell cancer. In 2008, this disease was renamed BPDCN by the World Health Organization, or WHO, due to its derivation from plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are specialized immune cells. BPDCN is a rare malignancy most commonly affects middle-aged and older patients and is approximately three times more common in men than women. This malignancy typically presents with skin lesions, as well as bone marrow involvement. BPDCN growth in the bone marrow results in decreased blood cell counts, which can lead to serious infections, fatigue, bleeding, and death. Although BPDCN responses have been reported with various combination chemotherapy regimens, overall prognosis remains poor. There are currently no approved therapies for BPDCN, and an optimal therapeutic regimen for BPDCN has not yet been established.
 
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
 
AML is a hematologic cancer characterized by dysregulated maturation of myeloid cells and failure of the bone marrow to properly function. AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. Approximately 21,350 new AML cases occur annually in the United States, and approximately 27,500 new cases occur annually in Europe. The average age of an AML patient is 67 years. The

one-year survival rate for AML after first relapse is approximately 20%. Current first-line treatments for AML include chemotherapy drugs such as cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline such as daunorubicin. In certain circumstances, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is also used. In second-line AML, typical therapies include additional chemotherapy, often cytarabine again at various dosages and regimens. Despite a moderate to high proportion of patients obtaining a CR with first- and second-line chemotherapy, many of these responding patients still unfortunately have a high relapse rate and poor OS and thus are in need for additional measures for longer term benefit.
 
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN)
 
A number of other rare hematologic diseases, each qualifying as an unmet medical need, express IL-3R including certain myeloproliferative syndromes, or MPNs, such as mastocytosis, clonal eosinophilic disorders, myelofibrosis, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. For a majority of patients with these conditions, there is no effective, disease modifying therapy.
 
Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. CMML is characterized by increased numbers of monocytes and immature blood cells (blasts) in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, as well as abnormal appearing cells (dysplasia) in at least one type of blood cell. CMML features characteristics of both MDS as well as a myeloproliferative disorder, or MPD. In the United States, the incidence of CMML is approximately 1,500 individuals per year. The median age at diagnosis of 65 to 70 years. One of the most common symptoms of CMML is splenomegaly, found in approximately half of cases. Other less frequent symptoms consist of anemia, fever, weight loss, night sweats, infection, bleeding, synovitis, lymphadenopathy, skin rashes, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and peritoneal effusion.  CMML can transform into AML in about 15%-20% of cases. Most cases are dealt with as supportive rather than curative because most therapies do not effectively increase survival. Supportive measures include blood transfusions and growth factors such as erythropoietic and granulocyte-stimulating factor. Reasons for more definitive treatment include the presence of fevers, chills, weight loss, symptomatic organ involvement, increasing blood counts, leukostasis, blood clotting, and/or progressive decreasing blood cell counts. The demethylating agents azacitidine (Vidaza®) and decitabine (Dacogen®) are FDA approved to treat CMML. High dose chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation is also employed to treat CMML, and may provide long term benefit.
 
Myelofibrosis. Primary myelofibrosis, or PMF, is characterized by the proliferation of an abnormal clone of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow and other sites, which results in fibrosis, or the replacement of the bone marrow with collagenous connective tissue fibers that, in turn, causes decreased blood cell counts. In the United States, the incidence of PMF is approximately 3,500 individuals per year. Median age at diagnosis is 66 years. About 30% of affected patients are less than 60 years of age. Manifestations include decreased blood cell counts, splenomegaly that is commonly painful, and increased immature white blood cells and basophils in the peripheral blood. The one known treatment of potential long-term benefit is high-dose chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Other treatment options are largely supportive, and do not alter the course of the disorder. These options may include administration of folic acid, allopurinol, and/or blood cell transfusions. Corticosteroids, alpha-interferon and/or hydroxyurea are also used.  Splenectomy is sometimes considered as a treatment option for patients with PMF in whom massive splenomegaly is contributing to anemia because of hypersplenism, particularly if there is a heavy requirement for blood transfusions.  Ruxolitinib (Jakafi®) has received regulatory approval in the United States and elsewhere for the treatment for PMFs, and has been associated with symptomatic improvement and increased overall survival, but its overall benefits can be short lived.  Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) and thalidomide (Thalomid®) may also be used in its treatment, although peripheral neuropathy can develop with long term use.
 
Multiple myeloma (MM)
 
MM is a hematologic malignancy that is characterized by the dysfunction of plasma cells, which are white blood cells that produce antibodies. During MM, malignant plasma cells overproduce abnormal monoclonal antibodies and can interfere with normal blood cell function in the bone marrow leading to immunodeficiency. Other common clinical manifestations of advanced MM include osteolytic bone lesions and renal disease. The bone marrow, or BM, microenvironment confers growth, survival, and drug resistance of MM cells, and it has recently been shown that plasmacytoid dendritic cells, or pDCs, which express high levels of IL-3R, are significantly increased in the BM of patients with MM and promote MM proliferation. Approximately 30,000 new cases of MM are reported annually in the United States (National Institute of Health, National Cancer Institute, 2016) and approximately 33,000 new MM cases are reported annually in Europe. The median age at diagnosis is 69 years. Patients who are transplant eligible have five-year survival rates of over 70%, while for elderly transplant-ineligible patients the rate is approximately 50%. Despite FDA approved therapies for MM, including thalidomide (Thalomid®), lenalidomide (Revlimid®), bortezomib (Velcade®), dexamethasone (Decadron®), carfilzomib (Krypolis®), pomalidomide (Pomalyst®), daratumaumab (Darzalex®), ixazomib (Ninlaro®), elotuzumab (Empliciti®), and panobinostat (Farydak®), many patients relapse from the disease.
 
Hairy cell leukemia (HCL)
 
HCL is an uncommon hematological malignancy characterized by a clonal accumulation of abnormal B lymphocytes. Approximately 1,500 new cases of HCL occur annually in the United States. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 52 years with male
 
10




predominance. Although there are FDA approved therapies for HCL, including cladribine, pentostatin, and interferon-alpha, there is no permanent cure for the disease and the relapsed/refractory setting represents an area of unmet medical need.
 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
 
MDS is a group of hematologic malignancies characterized by dysfunction of the blood and bone marrow, resulting in decreased peripheral blood counts and, at times, evolution into AML. Approximately 16,000 new cases of MDS are reported annually in the United States and approximately 30,000 new MDS cases are reported annually in Europe. MDS occurs most commonly in males 70 years or older. Five-year survival rates for MDS patients vary significantly depending on disease severity and prognosis and range from approximately 60% for low-risk patients, to 25% for intermediate-risk patients. Virtually all high-risk MDS patients die within five years. Treatment paradigms for MDS patients vary depending on disease classification and risk category. Current first-line treatments include azacitidine (Vidaza®), decitabine (Dacogen®), lenalidomide (Thalomid®), growth factors such as erythropoietic and granulocyte-stimulating factor, chemotherapy, and stem cell transplantation in certain cases. We believe that a large number of patients either do not respond or relapse following first-line treatment, and there are no approved therapies and limited effective treatment options in this high-risk setting.
 
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)
 
Chronic myeloid leukemia, or CML, is a hematopoietic stem cell disease resulting in impaired bone marrow function. Approximately 8,950 new cases are reported annually in the United States and approximately 10,000 new cases are reported annually in Europe. The five-year OS rate for CML patients is 62%. When CML advances to an accelerated or blastic phase, the median OS is approximately one year. In patients who have failed or are intolerant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs, a relapsed or refractory setting, the median OS is four to 11 months. Current first-line treatments for CML include TKIs such as: imatinib (Gleevec®), nilotinib (Tasigna®), dasatinib (Sprycel®) and ponatinib (Iclusig®). In cases of relapse, second and third-line treatments include a TKI not previously used in that patient. In certain circumstances, interferon or bone marrow transplantation is also used.
 
Hodgkins lymphoma (HL)
 
Hodgkins lymphoma, or HL, is a cancer of the lymphatic system that commonly affects lymph nodes in the neck or the area between the lungs and behind the breastbone. Approximately 8,250 new HL cases occur annually in the United States (National Institute of Health, National Cancer Institute, 2016) and approximately 19,000 cases occur annually in Europe (World Health Organization, International Agency for Research on Cancer). The disease has four subtypes, including nodular sclerosis, lymphocyte-rich, mixed cellularity, and lymphocyte-depleted HL, all of which produce increased numbers of a unique cell type called Reed-Sternberg cells. These cells are considered to be the clonal tumor cells of HL and are known to express the IL-3R. Although combination chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy are effective at combating this disease, 20-30% of patients relapse after initial treatment or have primary refractory disease. Of these patients, those who do not obtain CR prior to transplantation, or who relapse after second line therapy, have few effective therapeutic options. In 2015, brentuximab vedotin (Adcentris®) received regulatory approval in the United States and elsewhere for the treatment of relapsed or refractory HL. In addition, immunotherapies are approved for third-line patients.
 
SL-801
 
SL-801 is a structurally novel, oral, small molecule, reversible inhibitor of Exportin-1, or XPO1, a nuclear transport protein implicated in a variety of malignancies. SL-801 has demonstrated preclinical in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity against a wide array of solid and hematologic cancers. SL-801s potential ability to reversibly bind XPO1 may offer the possibility to mitigate side effects and help optimize the therapeutic index. We are currently enrolling patients with advanced solid tumors in a Phase 1 dose escalation trial of single agent SL-801.
 
XPO1 has been shown to regulate nuclear export of many of the major tumor suppressor proteins and oncogenic cell growth regulators. Overexpression of XPO1 has been reported in many cancer types and is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor patient prognosis. Inhibition of XPO1 has been shown to restore tumor suppressor function and proper cell cycle regulation, leading to apoptosis of cancer cells. XPO1 has also been shown to be a clinically validated target in both solid and hematological cancers. SL-801 has demonstrated broad and potent preclinical activity in a wide array of solid and hematologic tumors in both in vitro and in vivo xenograft experiments. In a screen against 240 cancer cell lines, SL-801 possessed strong anti-tumor activity, with 50% growth inhibitory values less than 10 nM in 21.3% of cell lines and less than 100 nM in 95.8% of cell lines. As a single agent, SL-801 also significantly prolonged overall survival and inhibited tumor growth in several mouse xenograft models of human multiple myeloma, as well as in xenograft models of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-small cell lung cancer and prostate carcinoma, in well-tolerated single-dose or multi-dose regimens. In contrast to an earlier XPO1 inhibitor not developed by us, leptomycin B, which may bind irreversibly to XPO1 and which caused significant toxicities in Phase 1 trials, preclinical data indicate that SL-801 binding to
 
11




XPO1 is more reversible than leptomycin B. SL-801s ability to reversibly bind XPO1 offers the potential to improve the therapeutic index in humans.
 
In September 2017, we presented an update on the SL-801 Phase 1 trial in patients with advanced solid tumors at the European Society of Medical Oncology, or ESMO, Annual Congress 2017 in Madrid, Spain. No dose limiting toxicity, or DLT, or maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, was identified. The most common TRAEs, through six dosing cohorts, include nausea (42%), fatigue (29%), diarrhea (21%), vomiting (17%), and decreased appetite (17%). The most common TRAEs, grade 3, were nausea (4%) and diarrhea (4%). There were no TRAEs above grade 3. Through these six dosing cohorts, stable disease, or SD, was reported in 38% (9/24) of patients, with tumor shrinkages (range: 3% to 21%) noted in some heavily pre-treated patients. Dose escalation is ongoing, with the ninth dosing cohort currently enrolling.
 
SL-701
 
SL-701 is an immunotherapy designed to direct the immune system to attack targets present on certain malignancies including brain cancer. SL-701 is comprised of 3 short synthetic peptides that correspond to epitopes of targets including IL-13Rα2, EphA2, and survivin; two of these synthetic peptides (IL-13Rα2 and survivin) are mutant and believed to enhance immune activity. We completed a Phase 2 trial of SL-701 in adult patients with second-line glioblastoma, or GBM.
 
Several previous investigator-sponsored trials utilizing an earlier version of SL-701 demonstrated clinical activity and manageable safety in adults and children with advanced brain cancers. We subsequently conducted and completed a corporate-sponsored Phase 2 trial, which consisted of 2 stages (Stage 1 and Stage 2). In Stage 1 of this trial (n=46 patients), SL-701 was administered as a single agent, with the immunostimulants GM-CSF and Imiquimod. In Stage 2 of the trial (n=28 patients), SL-701 was administered in combination with bevacizumab, with the immunostimulant poly-ICLC. Both Stages of the trial have completed enrollment and dosing, and patients are being followed for outcomes including survival. Preliminary data were presented at the Society for Neuro-Oncology, or SNO, meeting in November 2017 demonstrating major responses and durable stable diseases with SL-701 alone and in combination with bevacizumab in second-line GBM with a manageable safety profile. In Stage 1, one patient had a partial response, or PR, of 18+ month duration (ongoing), and there were 15 stable diseases, or SD, 6 of which were at least 5 months duration (range: 5 to 28+ months, ongoing). In Stage 2, 2 patients had complete responses, or CR, and 4 patients had PRs, for an ORR of 21% (6/28). SL-701 was generally well-tolerated. The most common treatment-related adverse events, or TRAEs, were fatigue (22%) and injection site reaction (18%). In Stage 2, the median overall survival, or OS, was 11.7 months with a 48% 12-month OS rate. In addition, analyses indicate that SL-701 generated target-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in some patients experiencing clinical benefit, consistent with its mechanism of action. Data are being analyzed and will be considered when deciding next steps for the program. These steps may include conducting larger studies, including randomized studies, single arm studies, further combination studies with novel agents, (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors), that could be conducted alone or via partnerships, or cessation of the program. If additional studies are conducted, this may entail significant manufacturing campaigns and commitments around SL-701 and certain immunostimulants depending upon the choice and availability of immunostimulants.
 
SL-701 was awarded Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of glioma in January 2015.
 
Preclinical pipeline
 
SL-501 and SL-101
 
We believe that CD123 is a rapidly emerging target in oncology with potential for broad application in hematologic cancer with promise beyond hematologic cancer in certain solid tumors and autoimmune disease. With this in mind, we are developing a platform of compounds that target CD123, led by our lead clinical stage asset, SL-401. SL-501 and SL-101 are both novel CD123-targeted therapies in preclinical development. SL-501 is a high-affinity variant of SL-401 that has shown potency, in vitro and in vivo, against several hematologic tumor types, including acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, chronic myeloid leukemia, or CML, Hodgkins lymphoma, or HL, and Non-Hodgkins lymphoma, or NHL. SL-101 is a single chain monoclonal antibody fragment (mAb)-conjugate that binds to CD123 and has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against a variety of hematologic cancers. In addition to oncology opportunities, we may also choose to evaluate the utility of these CD123- targeted agents in various autoimmune diseases, such as scleroderma and cutaneous lupus, in which the CD123-expressing plasmacytoid dendritic cell, or pDC, the precursor cell of BPDCN, may play a role.

SL-901
 
SL-901 is a small molecule kinase inhibitor. In December 2017, we in-licensed this drug candidate from UCB Biopharma Sprl, or UCB. Prior to in-licensing, the agent had shown preclinical activity in several tumors, and was evaluated in a small Phase 1 clinical trial in Europe. Neither a dose limiting toxicity, or DLT, nor a maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, was reached in the trial, and a partial response, or PR, in one patient with advanced lung cancer was reported. We are currently evaluating plans to produce drug supply under good manufacturing practice, or GMP, and conduct necessary non-clinical studies to enable a new regulatory filing to continue clinical dose escalation.
 
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
Our intellectual property portfolio consists of 40 issued patents and 37 pending applications in the U.S. and worldwide of both in-licensed and Stemline-originated inventions.
 
We continually assess our intellectual property strategy in order to fortify our position in our market space. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications in any of the above families should our intellectual property strategy require such filings and/or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities. Further, we are prepared to file patent applications relating to the other products in our pipeline soon after the experimental data necessary for a strong application become available and our cost-benefit analyses justify filing such applications.
 
In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we typically file counterpart patent applications in Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, and additional countries where we think such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial.
 
We do not know if patents will be issued for all of the patent applications in our portfolio, and there is no assurance that they will be. Furthermore, for patent claims now issued and for claims to be issued in the future, we do not know if such claims will provide significant proprietary protection to our drug candidates and proprietary technologies or if they will be challenged, circumvented, or invalidated. Our success will in part depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patents protecting our drug candidates, technologies and inventions, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third-parties, and to enforce and defend our patents and ensure others do not infringe on our proprietary rights.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patents term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee, and a patents term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent.
 
The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug or biologic is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug or biologic may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug or biologic. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We anticipate that some of our issued patents may be eligible for patent term extensions. For more information regarding U.S. patent laws, see Business  Government Regulation.
 
In addition to the patent term extension rights described above, any of our product candidates that receive FDA approval may also be eligible for market exclusivity protection under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. For more information regarding market exclusivity laws, see Business  Government Regulation.
 
Many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and academic institutions are competing with us in the field of oncology and filing patent applications potentially relevant to our business. In order to contend with the inevitable possibility of third-party intellectual property conflicts, from time to time, we review and assess the third-party intellectual property landscape for competitive and other developments that may inform or impact our intellectual property development and commercialization strategies.
 
From time to time, we may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from third-party intellectual property holders. Where licenses are readily available at reasonable cost, such licenses are considered a normal cost of doing business. In other instances, however, where a third-party holds relevant intellectual property and is a direct competitor, a license might not be available on
 
13




commercially reasonable terms or available at all. Accordingly, we attempt to manage the risk that such third-party intellectual property may pose by conducting, among other measures, freedom-to-operate studies to guide our early-stage research away from areas where we are likely to encounter obstacles in the form of third-party intellectual property. As our programs advance, we continue to monitor the intellectual property landscape in an effort to assess the advisability of licensing third-party intellectual property or taking other appropriate steps to address such freedom-to-operate or development issues in the manner we deem in the best interests of the Company.
 
With respect to third-party intellectual property, it is impossible to establish with certainty that our product candidates or discovery platform will be free of claims by third-party intellectual property holders or whether we will require licenses from such third-parties. Even with modern databases and on-line search engines, literature searches are imperfect and may fail to identify relevant patents and published applications. Even when a third-party patent is identified, we may conclude, upon a thorough analysis, that we do not infringe the patent or that the patent is invalid. If the third-party patent owner disagrees with our conclusion and we continue with the business activity in question, we might face patent litigation by the third-party. Alternatively, we might decide to initiate litigation in an attempt to have a court declare the third-party patent invalid or not infringed by our activity. In either scenario, patent litigation typically is costly and time-consuming, and the outcome is uncertain. The outcome of patent litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be quantified in advance, for example, the credibility of expert witnesses who may disagree on technical interpretation of scientific data. Ultimately, in the case of an adverse outcome in litigation, we could be prevented from commercializing a product or using certain aspects of our discovery platform as a result of patent infringement claims asserted against us and/or face a significant monetary damages award. This could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
To protect our competitive position, it may be necessary to enforce our patent rights through litigation against infringing third-parties. Litigation to enforce our own patent rights is subject to the same uncertainties discussed above. In addition, however, litigation involving our patents carries the risk that one or more of our patents will be held invalid (in whole or in part, on a claim-by-claim basis) or held unenforceable. Such an adverse court ruling could allow third-parties to commercialize our products or our platform technology, and then compete directly with us, without payment to us.
 
Patents and Proprietary Rights Covering Stemlines Drug Candidates
 
We have an exclusive worldwide license to SL-401. These patent rights include issued U.S. Patents, 7,763,242, 8,470,307, 9,181,317, and 9,631,006 covering methods of treating AML, BPDCN and MDS that expire in 2027 and 2028, as applicable, as well as six issued foreign patents. There are additional pending U.S. applications directed to methods of using SL-401 to treat other diseases that, if issued, would also expire in 2027. In addition, we have filed foreign patent applications for the method of using SL- 401 to treat various diseases, although there can be no assurances that such patents will be issued.

License and Research Agreements
 
Scott and White Memorial Hospital
 
Research and License Agreement (SL-401)
 
In June 2006, we entered into a research and license agreement with Scott and White Memorial Hospital (Temple, Texas) for SL-401, our biologic targeted therapy directed to the IL-3R. Under the agreement, Scott and White has granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide license under certain patent rights, know-how and materials to research, develop, make, have made, formulate, use, sell, offer to sell and import SL-401, and any products containing or comprising such compound in finished dosage pharmaceutical form, for the diagnosis, prophylaxis and/or treatment of any disease or condition in humans or animals. The patent rights exclusively licensed to us under the agreement are described in more detail above under Business  Patents and Proprietary Rights.
 
We must pay Scott and White royalties based on adjusted gross sales, by us or our sublicensees, of products containing the licensed compound for a period of ten years following the first commercial sale of each product in each country. The royalty rates for each product range from the low- to mid-single digits and are tiered based on our annual sales. We have sublicensing rights under the agreement, subject to our paying to Scott and White a percentage of the up-front payments we receive from a sublicensee.
 
We must exercise commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a licensed product and to achieve certain regulatory milestones within certain periods, subject to extensions based on unforeseen technical, scientific, intellectual property or regulatory issues. If we fail to comply with our diligence obligations with respect to at least one licensed product, then Scott and White may convert our exclusive license to a non-exclusive license.
 
The agreement survives until the later of the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent or the date on which we owe no further payments to Scott and White, after which our license becomes fully paid, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive and royalty-free. We may terminate the license in whole or on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon prior written notice to Scott and
 
15




White. If either we or Scott and White breach a material obligation under the agreement, and such obligation is not cured within a specified period of time following written notice from the other party, then the non-breaching party may terminate the agreement upon an additional written notice.
 
In addition, the agreement provides for Scott and White to conduct a research program with SL-401. In March 2010, the agreement was amended to further the regulatory advancement of SL-401. We have made certain payments to Scott and White for such research services pursuant to the agreement, which to date total approximately $1.0 million in the aggregate. Additionally, we have been granted the exclusive right of reference to its IND for our own regulatory filings. We may assign the agreement to an affiliate of ours, a purchaser of all or substantially all of our assets or in connection with a merger, change in control or similar transaction by us.
 
CanBas, Ltd
 
License for SL-801
 
On December 26, 2014, we entered into a license agreement with CanBas, Ltd. for SL-801. SL-801 is a small molecule, reversible inhibitor of XPO1. Under the terms of the agreement, CanBas has granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide (excluding Japan, Korea, China and Taiwan) license, under certain patent rights, know-how and materials to research, develop, make, have made, formulate, use, sell, offer to sell and import SL-801, and any products containing or comprising such compound in finished dosage pharmaceutical form, for the treatment of any disease or condition in humans. The patent rights exclusively licensed to us under the agreement are described in more detail above under Patents and Proprietary Rights Covering Stemlines Drug Candidates.
 
We are responsible to pay an annual technical advisory fee in December 2018 totaling 110 million Japanese Yen (JPY), if the clinical development continues over this time period. Additionally, we must pay CanBas tiered royalties based on aggregate net sales, by us or our sublicensees, of products containing the licensed compound until the latest date of a period of ten years following the first commercial sale of each product in each country; the date upon which there are no more valid claims or the expiration or termination of the last regulatory exclusivity period. The royalty rates start in the low single digits and are tiered up based on annual net sales. In the future, we may also be responsible, based on the achievement of specific clinical-development, regulatory and sales-based commercial milestones, for certain payments to CanBas of up to $86 million. We have sublicensing rights under the agreement, subject to our paying to CanBas a standard royalty percentage of the payments we receive from a sublicensee.
 
We must exercise commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a licensed product and to achieve certain regulatory milestones within certain periods, subject to extensions based on unforeseen technical, scientific, intellectual property or regulatory issues.
 
The agreement survives until the later of ten years following the first commercial sale of each product in each country; the date upon which there are no more valid claims; or the expiration or termination of the last regulatory exclusivity period, after which our license becomes fully paid, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive and royalty-free. We may terminate the license for any or no reason upon 60 days advance written notice to CanBas. If either we or CanBas breach a material obligation under the agreement, and such obligation is not cured within a specified period of time following written notice from the other party, then the non-breaching party may terminate the agreement upon an additional written notice.
 
University of Pittsburgh
 
Exclusive License Agreement to IL-13Rα2 peptide (SL-701 component)
 
In September 2009, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Pittsburgh, or the University, for the composition of matter, and use with other components, of a proprietary immunogenic mutant analog peptide of IL-13Rα2, an active ingredient of SL-701, our brain cancer immunotherapy candidate. Under the agreement, the University grants us an exclusive worldwide license under certain patent rights to make, have made, use, sell and import brain cancer peptide antigen immunotherapies (including SL-701, which has been developed by the University under a separate immunotherapy name designated by the University). The patent rights exclusively licensed to us under the agreement are described in more detail above under Business  Patents and Proprietary Rights. The University retains the right to practice the licensed patent rights for non-commercial education and research purposes. The license is also subject to certain retained rights of the United States government. Our right to grant sublicenses to third parties is subject to the prior written approval of the University, which the University may not unreasonably withhold or delay.
 
We paid the University an initial license fee and will pay the University annual license maintenance fees until the first commercial sale of a licensed product. To date, we have paid an aggregate of approximately $0.7 million in fees to the University under the agreement. We must also pay the University a low-single digit royalty as a percentage of net sales of licensed products by us or our sublicensees, with standard provisions for royalty offsets to the extent we need to obtain any rights from third-parties to commercialize
 
16




the licensed products. We must also pay a minimum annual royalty following the first commercial sale of a licensed product, but only to the extent the minimum annual royalty amount is greater than the annual royalty otherwise due. We also must pay the University a percentage of non-royalty revenue we receive from our sublicensees, which decreases if we enter into the applicable sublicense agreement after a certain clinical milestone has been met. We also must make certain payments to the University of up to approximately $4.2 million upon the achievement of specific regulatory and commercial milestone events.
 
We must use our commercially reasonable best efforts to develop or commercialize a licensed product as soon as practicable, and to continue active, diligent marketing efforts throughout the term of the agreement. We also must adhere to certain specific regulatory milestones with respect to initiating clinical trials and submitting an application for regulatory approval of a licensed product. If we fail to meet any such milestone through no fault of our own, we may negotiate with the University a one-time extension of the applicable dates, subject to paying the University a fee. If we do not meet the extended milestone dates, then the University may terminate the agreement.
 
The agreement survives until the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent. The University may terminate the agreement if we default in the performance of any of our obligations and do not cure the default within a specified period of time after receiving notice from the University, or if we challenge the validity, enforceability or ownership of the license patent rights anywhere in the world. The University may also terminate the agreement if we cease to carry out our business or become bankrupt or insolvent. We may terminate the agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to the University and payment of all amounts due to the University through the date of termination. Any sublicense agreement entered into prior to termination will survive, subject to certain customary conditions. We may assign the agreement to an affiliate of ours, a purchaser of all or substantially all of our assets or in connection with a merger, change in control or similar transaction by us.
 
Non-Exclusive License Agreement to EphA2 peptide (SL-701 component)
 
In March 2012, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with the University for the use of EphA2 epitopes, another active ingredient of SL-701. Under the agreement, the University grants us a non-exclusive worldwide license under certain patent rights to use the EphA2 peptide in or packaged with the IL-13Rα2 peptide, as well as other immunotherapies we may develop and own or exclusively control, for the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of diseases and tumors of the brain in human patients. The patent rights licensed to us under the agreement are described in more detail above under Business  Patents and Proprietary Rights. The University retains the right to practice the licensed patent rights for non-commercial education and research purposes. The license grant is also subject to certain retained rights of the United States government. We may only grant sublicenses to third parties who are permitted sublicensees under the exclusive IL-13Rα2 peptide license agreement with the University.
 
We must pay the University an initial license fee, and will pay the University annual license maintenance fees until the net sales of a licensed product exceed a specified amount. To date, we have paid an aggregate of approximately $0.1 million in fees to the University under the agreement. We must also pay the University a customary low-single digit royalty for the license as a percentage of net sales of licensed products by us or our sublicensees, with standard provisions for royalty offsets to the extent we need to obtain any rights from third-parties to commercialize the licensed products. We must also pay a minimum annual royalty following the first commercial sale of a licensed product, but only to the extent the minimum annual royalty amount is greater than the annual royalty otherwise due.
 
We must use our commercially reasonable best efforts to develop or commercialize a licensed product as soon as practicable, and to continue active, diligent marketing efforts throughout the term of the agreement. We also must adhere to certain specific regulatory milestones with respect to initiating clinical trials and submitting an application for regulatory approval of a licensed product. If we fail to meet any such milestone by certain specified dates, then the University may terminate the agreement.
 
The agreement survives until the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent. The University may terminate the agreement if we default in the performance of any of our obligations and do not cure the default within a specified time period of receiving notice from the University. The University may also terminate the agreement if we cease to carry out our business or become bankrupt or insolvent. We may terminate the agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to the University and payment of all amounts due to the University through the date of termination. Any sublicense agreement entered into prior to termination will survive, subject to certain customary conditions. We may assign the agreement to an affiliate of ours, a purchaser of all or substantially all of our assets or in connection with a merger, change in control or similar transaction by us.
 
Non-Exclusive License Agreement to use and reference certain data, information and regulatory filings (SL-701)
 
In March 2012, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with the University. Pursuant to the agreement, we acquired a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use and reference certain know-how, information and data that is contained in the INDs covering the clinical trials of SL-701 that were conducted by the University for the development, manufacture, regulatory approval and
 
17




commercialization of pharmaceutical products. We may grant sublicenses in conjunction with a sublicense to a permitted sublicensee under the exclusive IL-13Rα2 peptide license agreement with the University.
 
We paid the University an initial license fee, as well as payments following a regulatory milestone. To date, we have paid an aggregate of approximately $27,500 in fees to the University under the agreement. We also must pay the University a percentage of non-royalty revenue we receive from our sublicensees. We must use our commercially reasonable best efforts to develop or commercialize a product derived from the use of the licensed data or information as soon as practicable. We also must adhere to a specific regulatory milestone with respect to submitting an application for regulatory approval that incorporates the licensed data or information, and if we fail to meet the milestone, the University may terminate the agreement unless we have pre-paid the milestone payment listed above.
 
The term of the license agreement is 20 years, and the University may terminate the agreement earlier (i) if we default in the performance of any of our obligations and do not cure the default within a specified time period, (ii) upon the termination of the exclusive IL-13Rα2 peptide license agreement with the University, or (iii) if we cease to carry out our business or become bankrupt or insolvent. We may terminate the agreement at any time prior to incorporating or referencing the data or University INDs, after a specified number of days following written notice. We may assign the agreement to an affiliate of ours, a purchaser of all or substantially all of our assets or in connection with a merger, change in control or similar transaction by us.
 
Cambridge University Technical Services Limited
 
Exclusive Patent and Non-Exclusive Know-How License Agreement (Platform Technology)
 
In September 2004, we entered into a license agreement with Cambridge University Technical Services Limited, or CUTS, relating to our StemScreen® platform technology. Under the agreement, we acquired an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide license under patent rights owned by CUTS to develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, sell, offer to sell, market, have marketed, import, have imported, export and have exported products covered by the patent rights, including a platform technology to discover and screen for compounds that target CSCs. The patent rights exclusively licensed to us under the agreement are described in more detail above under Business  Patents and Proprietary Rights. The license is subject to certain rights retained by CUTS for academic research and teaching. We also acquired a non-exclusive, worldwide license to know-how related to the licensed patent rights. The agreement provides us with full sublicensing rights. Under the agreement, we paid an upfront license fee and are obligated to make milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $1.7 million upon specified regulatory events, as well as pay royalties of less than 1% on sales of licensed products. CUTS may terminate the agreement, including our rights to the platform technology, for specified cause or upon certain events involving our bankruptcy or insolvency.
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Additionally, there has been an increase in development of therapeutics targeting ultra orphan and rare oncologic indications, our main area of focus. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology, and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
There are several biopharmaceutical companies whose primary focus appears to be developing therapies against CSCs, including Verastem, Inc., OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co. Ltd., Bionomics Limited and Stemcentrx, Inc. (an AbbVie, Inc., company). There are also several biopharmaceutical companies that do not appear to be primarily focused on CSCs, but may be developing at least one CSC-directed compound. These companies include Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Geron Corp., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Ignyta, Inc., Macrogenics Inc., Micromet, Inc. (an Amgen, Inc. company), Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding AG, Sanofi U.S. LLC, and others. Additionally, there are a number of companies working to develop new treatments for hematologic cancers, which may compete with SL-401 and SL-801, including AbbVie, Inc., Ambit Biosciences Corporation (a Daiichi Sankyo company), Amgen, Inc., Astex Pharmaceuticals (now an Otsuka Pharmaceutical company), Celator Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Celgene Corporation, Cellectis, Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Eisai Co. Ltd., Genzyme Corporation (a Sanofi company), Immunogen, Inc., Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson and Johnson, Karyopharm Therapeutics, Inc., Novartis AG, Seattle Genetics, Inc., and Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., among others. There are also a number of drugs used for the treatment of brain cancer that may compete with SL-701, including, Avastin® (Roche Holding AG), Gliadel® (Eisai Co. Ltd.), and Temodar® (Merck & Co., Inc.). There are a number of companies working to develop brain cancer therapeutics with programs in clinical testing, including Agenus Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Inc., Cortice Biosciences, Inc., Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., CytRx Corporation,

GenSpera, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc., ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd., Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc., Novartis AG, Roche Holding AG and others.
 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Small or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.  Also, if our competitors receive marketing approval for a product for which it has an orphan designation, we may not be able to receive marketing approval for one of our products for the same indication unless it demonstrates clinical superiority to such product. Our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over any competitive generic products.
 
The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy. These therapies are numerous and varied in their design, therapeutic application and mechanism of action. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain market approval. In addition to currently marketed oncology therapies, there are also a number of products in late stage clinical development to treat cancer. These products in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain market approval.
 
Competition for SL-401
 
There are a number of companies working to develop new treatments for AML and other hematologic cancers, including Agios, Inc., Ambit Biosciences Corporation (now a Daiichi Sankyo company), Astex Pharmaceuticals (an Otsuka Pharmaceutical company), Boehringer Ingelheim, Celator Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a Jazz Pharmaceuticals company), Celgene Corporation, Cellectis, Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Eisai Co. Ltd., Epizyme, Inc., Genzyme Corporation (a Sanofi company), Immunogen, Inc., Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson and Johnson, Seattle Genetics, Inc., and Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., among others.

Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, approval, manufacture, testing, quality control, packaging, labeling, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Any pharmaceutical candidate that we develop must be approved by the FDA before it may be legally marketed in the United States or by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before it may be legally marketed in foreign countries.
United States Drug Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Biologics are subject to regulation by the FDA under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and related regulations, and other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Biological products include, among other things, viruses, therapeutic serums, vaccines and most protein products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include a clinical hold, refusal to approve pending applications, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, civil or criminal penalties, or withdrawal of an approval.  Any administrative action or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 
·                  Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices or other applicable regulations;
 
·                  Submission to the FDA of an IND which FDA must clear before human clinical trials may begin;
 
·                  Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDAs current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, and in accordance with human subject protection regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic for its intended use;
 
·                  Submission to the FDA of a NDA for a new drug product, or a BLA for a new biological product;
 
·                  Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic is to be produced to assess compliance with the FDAs current good manufacturing practice regulations, or cGMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drugs or biologics identity, strength, quality and purity;
 
·                  Potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
 
·                  FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA and successful resolution of any questions that arise in the review process.
 
The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations post-approval require the expenditure of substantial resources.  There can be no certainty that approvals will be granted.
 
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug or biological candidate enters the preclinical testing stage.  Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug or biological candidate.  The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices.  The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND.  The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period.  In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.  The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug or biological candidate at
 
20




any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance.  Accordingly, we cannot assure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trial.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug or biological candidate to healthy volunteers or patients having the disease being studied under the supervision of qualified investigators; often these are physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsors control.  Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.  Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDAs good clinical practices requirements, regulations for the protection of human subjects and with applicable cGMP requirements.  Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted.  An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.  The IRB also approves trial recruitment materials and the informed consent form that must be used as part of the informed consent process with each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed.
 
Human clinical trials prior to approval are typically conducted in three sequential Phases that may overlap or be combined:
 
·                  Phase 1.  The drug or biologic is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients having the specific disease.
·                  Phase 2.  The drug or biologic is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule for patients having the specific disease.
·                  Phase 3.  Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials, which usually involve more subjects than earlier trials, are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or BLA.
 
Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as part of the approval process.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA by the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug or biological candidate.  In addition, companies must develop and validate analytical methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of raw materials, in-process material and the final drug or biologic.  Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug or biological candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug or biologic, proposed packaging and labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the
 
21




payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. We believe that we will be required to submit BLAs for SL-401 and SL-701, and to submit an NDA for SL-801.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or a BLA, or supplement to an NDA or a BLA, that covers a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. PREA does not apply to any drug or biologic for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted unless FDA were to issue a regulation to require pediatric assessments.
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA or BLA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has established a performance goal of ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA or BLA and respond to the applicant, and a performance goal of six months for a priority NDA or BLA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs and BLAs.
 
After the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the products identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the products continued safety, purity and potency. In addition to its own review, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts in the disease area, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. On September 27, 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted, giving the FDA enhanced post-market authority, including the authority to require post-marketing studies and post-marketing clinical trials related to serious risks, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, approved by the FDA. The FDAs exercise of this authority can result in delays or increased costs during the period of product development, clinical trials and regulatory review and approval, which may also increase costs related to complying with new post-approval regulatory requirements, and increase potential FDA restrictions on the sale or distribution of approved products. During the approval process, the FDA will determine whether a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug or biologic post-approval. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without a REMS, if required.
 
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is to be manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.  Also, in this inspection, the FDA seeks to determine whether the manufacturing conforms with application commitments, the authenticity and accuracy of data, and the adequacy of the companys analytical methodology.  Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with current good clinical practices, or cGCPs. If the FDA determines the application, data, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information.
 
The NDA or BLA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or the agency requires additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, protocol deviations or data discrepancies could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.  The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials.
 
Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a products safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product for the same indication as defined by the FDA or if our drug or biological candidate is determined to be contained within the competitors product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar but not identical benefits in the European Union.
 
In June 2013, SL-401 was awarded Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of BPDCN. Previously, in February 2011, we received Orphan Drug Designation for SL-401 for the treatment of AML. In September 2015, SL-401 received Orphan Drug designation from the EMA for the treatment of AML. In November 2015, SL-401 was granted Orphan Drug designation by the EMA for the treatment of BPDCN. In addition, we received Orphan Drug Designation for SL-701 for the treatment of glioma in January 2015.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
The FDA has established a Breakthrough Therapy designation program wherein a drug may receive this designation if it is intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over available therapies. Drugs receiving FDA designation as breakthrough therapies typically receive intensive guidance from FDAs review teams for efficient drug development, organizational commitment from FDA, and rolling review of applications submitted for approval, among other things.
 
The FDA also has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drug and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the drug product alone or in combination with one or more other drugs for the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider reviewing sections of the NDA or BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted.  In addition, the sponsor and FDA would agree on a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA. If the FDA agrees to a rolling review of a NDA or BLA, and determines that the schedule is acceptable, the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
 
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing approval, including those submitted to a Fast Track program, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.  Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared with marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review with the goal of taking Agency action on a marketing application within 6 months.
 
23




Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to establish safety and efficacy for the approved indication. Failure to conduct such studies, or conducting such studies that do not establish the required safety and efficacy may result in revocation of the original approval. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch or subsequent marketing of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval may expedite the development or approval process.
 
Lastly, a product may be eligible for breakthrough designation and expedited development and review by FDA. A Breakthrough Therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.  The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy designation include more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program, an organizational commitment involving senior FDA managers, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review of marketing applications.  The receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and a Breakthrough Therapy designation may be rescinded by FDA where subsequent data no longer support the Breakthrough Therapy designation of the candidate. In August 2016, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to SL-401 for the treatment of BPDCN.  There can be no assurance that SL-401 will be approved by the FDA on a faster timeline with this indication or at all.  In addition, the FDA may later decide that SL-401 no longer meets the conditions for designation.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any drug or biological products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, cGMP compliance, record-keeping requirements, reporting of nonconforming distributed products which would require field alert reports (FARs) for NDAs and biological product deviation reports (BPDRs) for BLAs, reporting of adverse events, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information on an annual basis or as required more frequently for specific events, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions against promoting drugs and biologics for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drugs or biologics approved labeling (known as off-label promotion), rules for conducting industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, limitations on comparative or superiority claims and promotional activities involving data presentations. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including for cause inspections; warning or untitled letters from the FDA, including demands for correction or removal of noncomplying product; adverse publicity; mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors; and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs and biologics for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
 
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Manufacturers of our product candidates are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDAs cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of comprehensive records and documentation. We are required by law to establish adequate oversight and control over raw materials, components and finished products furnished by our third-party manufacturers, which we establish by contract, supplier qualification and periodic audits, but unforeseen circumstances could affect our third-party manufacturers compliance with applicable regulations and standards. Drug and biologic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs and biologics are also required to register their establishments and list any products made there with the FDA and comply with related requirements in certain states, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in serious and extensive restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including suspension of a product until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, continuing oversight of manufacturing by the FDA under a consent decree, which frequently includes the imposition of penalties for failure to comply with the terms of the consent decree, audits conducted by outside experts, extensive reporting requirements, and possible withdrawal of the product from the market. Historically, the minimum term of an FDA consent decree has been five years, and violation of consent decree terms can result in the extension of the consent decree term.
 
24




Major changes to the manufacturing process and other types of major changes, such as adding new indications, require prior FDA approval before being implemented.  Moderate and minor changes require FDA notification but not prior approval.
 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could otherwise restrict the distribution or use of the product.
 
On July 9, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, among other things, renewed the drug user fee program, expanded the FDAs inspection records access and required manufacturers to establish appropriate oversight and controls over their suppliers and the supply chain, including raw material suppliers and contract manufacturers, as a part of cGMP compliance. On November 27, 2013, the Drug Quality and Security Act, which included the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, was enacted to, among other things, build an electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States. Requirements for the tracing of products through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain took effect on January 1, 2015 for manufacturers and building internal systems to ensure compliance with this law will require dedication of resources. In addition, this law requires engaging in transactions only with authorized trading partners and can limit the pool of available trading partners. On August 18, 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, among other things, reauthorized and amended the user fee program eliminating the establishment fee and replacing the Prescription Drug Product Fee with a Prescription Drug Program Fee.
 
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our drug and biologics candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Although drafted to cover small-molecule drugs, as opposed to biologics, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during federal regulatory review preceding the FDA regulatory review process. The FDA has been granting patent term extensions to biologics. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the products approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or a BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug or biologic is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted within 60 days of approval and prior to the expiration of the patent. Further, to be eligible for patent term extension a drug must be the first permitted commercial marketing for which there was a regulatory review period. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA, which are independent of patent status and any patent-related extensions and can run concurrently with a patent or not, can also delay the submission or effective approval of certain applications of companies seeking to reference another companys NDA.  The length of time that the FDA grants depends on the type of exclusivity.
 
If the new drug that is the subject of an approved NDA contains a new chemical entity, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States that runs from the date of NDA approval.  FDA regulations define new chemical entity as a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. 21 C.F.R. § 314.108.  During the five-year exclusivity period, no company may submit an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA for a drug product that contains the same active moiety as in the new chemical entity.  However, such application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement to one of the patents listed in FDAs Orange Book by the innovator NDA holder.
 
The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, that contained new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant and are deemed by FDA to be essential to the approval of the NDA or supplement.  Such new clinical investigations may support approval of, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity period runs from the date of approval of the NDA or supplement containing the new clinical investigations and covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations.  That is, it bars the FDA from approving an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for those conditions of approval.  Unlike NCE exclusivity, exclusivity for new clinical investigations does not prohibit the submission of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA by another company during that three-year period.
 
25




Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted by the FDA, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a trial. Biologic products that are subject to the PHSA are not eligible for pediatric exclusivity under the FDCA.
 
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009
 
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA to create a new licensure framework for biosimilar products, which could ultimately subject our biological product candidates to competition. Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biological product that is biosimilar to or interchangeable with a referenced, branded biologic product. Previously, there had been no licensure pathway for such biosimilar or interchangeable products. For purposes of the BPCIA, a reference product is defined as the single biological product licensed under a full BLA against which a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under a follow-on BLA.
 
The BPCIA also created a 12-year period of reference product exclusivity, which can be extended to 12.5 years with pediatric exclusivity. The 12-year exclusivity period begins on the date of first licensure of the reference product under the PHSA and during which the licensure of a follow-on application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product cannot be made effective. During the first four years (or four and one-half years with pediatric exclusivity) of the 12-year period, an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable version of the reference product cannot be submitted to the FDA. Recently. members have begun introducing bills that would decrease the reference product exclusivity reference product exclusivity from 12 to seven years. Congress has not yet enacted such a change in the BPCIA, but could move to enact such a decrease in the reference product exclusivity period.
 
The BPCIA includes limits on obtaining 12-year reference product exclusivity for certain changes or modifications to the reference product. A separate 12-year reference product exclusivity period does not apply to:
 
·                  a BLA supplement for the product that is the reference product;
 
·                  a subsequent BLA filed by the same reference product sponsor or manufacturer (or a licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength; or
 
·                  a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency.
 
In addition to creating a 12-year period of reference product exclusivity, the BPCIA clarifies the interaction of that exclusivity with orphan drug exclusivity, such that, if a reference product has been designated for a rare disease or condition the licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable version of a reference product for such disease or condition may only occur after the later of the expiration of any applicable seven-year orphan drug exclusivity or the 12-year reference product exclusivity (or seven and one-half years and 12.5 years with pediatric exclusivity).
 
Like pediatric exclusivity applicable to drug products approved under the FDCA, pediatric exclusivity applicable to biological reference products is subject to an exception. Pediatric exclusivity will not apply to either the 12-year reference product or the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity periods if the FDA has not determined that the study reports a BLA sponsor submitted in response to a written request for pediatric studies met the terms of that request before nine months prior to the expiration of such period.
 
26




Our biological product candidates, if approved, could be considered reference products entitled to 12-year exclusivity. Even if our products are considered to be reference products eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of any of our biological products if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsors own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product.
 
The BPCIA also sets forth a complex mechanism for resolving patent disputes that involves a step-wise exchange of information prior to the initiation of a patent infringement lawsuit against a biosimilar or interchangeable product sponsor. Unlike the Hatch-Waxman Act, the BPCIA provides no automatic stay on approval of a biosimilar product application, except an interchangeable product receives the lesser of one year of exclusivity after the date of first commercial marketing or 18 months of exclusivity after a final court decision or dismissal of a patent challenge or, if the applicant has not been sued, after approval.  The BPCIA does not prevent a competitor from conducting its own clinical trials and submitting a full BLA on the same or similar product.
 
There is also currently substantial uncertainty as to how certain terms of the BPCIA will be interpreted by the Courts, which may affect the timing of the entry of a biosimilar or interchangeable product to market, and the required notice that the owner of the reference product exclusivity must be given by the owner of the application of a biosimilar or interchangeable product.  Should the courts resolve the interpretation issues in favor of the biosimilar or interchangeable product applicants, the BPCIA may offer more limited exclusivity to the reference product than currently believed.
 
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General and the Office of Civil Rights), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, state attorney generals and state and local governments.  For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and similar state laws, each as amended.  Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, each as amended.  If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Under the Veterans Health Care Act, or VHCA, drug companies are required to offer certain pharmaceutical products at a reduced price to four federal agencies including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the United States Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities (including the Indian Health Service) in order for reimbursement to be available for our product under Medicare and Medicaid.  FSS pricing to these four agencies must be equal to or less than the federal ceiling price (FCP), which is, at a minimum, 24% off the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price for the prior fiscal year.  Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
 
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. In addition, in August 2013, the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act took effect and requires annual reporting by prescription drug manufacturers with at least 1 approved product of certain payments and transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals.  Post-approval of any of our product candidates, we will need to ensure compliance with annual tracking and reporting of these payments and transfers of value to CMS.
 
Europe and Worldwide Government Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
 
27




Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each countrys national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a countrys requirements, clinical trials may proceed.
 
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are required to be in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) / WHO Good Clinical Practice standards and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application to the EMA. The application used to file an NDA or a BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For example, the EMA has already established a number of guidelines for approval of various biosimilars.
 
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with cGCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug or biological candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug or biological product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug or biological product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug or biological products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug or biological products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our drug or biological candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payors decision to provide coverage for a drug or biological product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 
In 2003, the United States government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs and biologics may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. Federal, state and local governments in the United States continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug or biological candidates that we are developing.
 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug or biological candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and biologics, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
28




The marketability of any drug or biological candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities for the clinical or commercial production of our drug candidates. For past investigator sponsored studies, all drug substance and drug product for SL-401 and SL-701 was manufactured at academic and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMO, facilities, as directed by our academic collaborators. We have now developed manufacturing processes that are suitable for full-scale cGMP manufacturing.  Additionally, we have qualified FDA-audited third-party CMOs to produce sufficient quantities of SL-401, SL-801, and SL-701 drug substance and drug product of suitable quality for our active and contemplated corporate sponsored clinical trials and potential commercialization. For SL-401, activities are underway to deliver commercial supplies in support of potential expedited approval pathways. Our manufacturing programs are being managed with oversight by our manufacturing team, which is comprised of full-time employees and consultants with experience in manufacturing pharmaceutical drug substance and drug products.
SL-401 Manufacturing and Supply
 
SL-401 is a recombinant protein generated from an antibiotic-resistance driven DNA-based plasmid vector and manufactured by bacterial fermentation in E. Coli. For past investigator sponsored studies, SL-401 was manufactured at Wake Forest University. We have optimized the protein expression, generated cGMP master and working cell banks, and developed the fermentation and purification steps of our manufacturing process to be suitable for scale-up in standard manufacturing equipment. This technology has been transferred to a third-party CMO with expertise in bacterial fermentation, which has further optimized and scaled-up the process in their cGMP production suite. The SL-401 drug substance has now met standard industry quality specifications and is adequate to support our ongoing and planned corporate sponsored clinical trials. The drug product formulation and manufacturing process has been transferred to a third-party CMO with expertise in sterile product manufacture for clinical and commercial supply, and they have successfully produced drug product meeting cGMP requirements for use in clinical studies. We expect the same process, scale and CMOs will be used to manufacture drug substance and drug product for commercial supply. We have a lyophilized formulation of SL-401, which is currently being developed.
SL-801 Manufacturing and Supply
 
SL-801 is a small molecule that is prepared via synthetic organic chemistry. We have completed process development and cGMP manufacturing at an adequate scale to supply our ongoing and planned corporate sponsored clinical studies. We have also developed a stable solid-oral tablet formulation that has been produced using cGMP manufacturing equipment at our third-party CMO. We believe that the manufacturing scale and product quality procedures and oversight ensure an adequate supply for our active and planned corporate sponsored clinical studies.
SL-701 Manufacturing and Supply
 
SL-701 is an immunotherapy that is comprised of several short synthetic peptides. Each of the component peptides of SL-701 is manufactured individually by solid-phase synthesis and all have been prepared to acceptable quality specifications in cGMP manufacturing equipment by our third-party CMO. The manufacturing scale and product quality procedures and oversight ensure an adequate supply for our active and planned corporate sponsored clinical studies. We have also developed a stable formulation that combines the individual peptides in a single sterile solution to generate SL-701 drug product. This manufacturing process was transferred to a third-party CMO with expertise in sterile product manufacture. This CMO has produced multiple cGMP drug product batches of sufficient quality and quantity to supply our corporate sponsored clinical trials. SL-701 has been utilized with several different adjuvants including Montanide, GM-CSF, Imiquimod, and poly-ICLC. We have been, and may continue to be, reliant on the availability of these adjuvants from their respective manufacturers.
Sales and Marketing
 
We believe the infrastructure required to commercialize oncology products is relatively limited, which may make it cost-effective for us to internally develop, train, and deploy a marketing sales force. If SL-401 or our other compounds are approved by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, we plan to potentially build the infrastructure to commercialize these products in North America and
 
29




Europe ourselves. However, we will remain opportunistic in seeking strategic partnerships in these and other markets when advantageous.
 
The commercial infrastructure of specialty oncology products typically consists of a targeted, specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group, and distribution support. Additional capabilities important to the oncology marketplace include the management of key accounts, such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies, oncology group networks, and government accounts. As SL-401 and our other compounds may initially be developed for orphan indications with a relatively small number of treating physicians, we anticipate that a reduced infrastructure, including a small, targeted sales force, will be sufficient to support our sales and marketing objectives. In order to implement this infrastructure, we will have to allocate management resources and make significant financial investments including some prior to product approval to prepare for the commercial launch of an approved product, including preparation of marketing and sales training materials in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
