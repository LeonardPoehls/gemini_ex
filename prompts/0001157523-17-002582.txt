General
 
Our name is Aurum, Inc. and we sometimes refer to ourselves in this Annual Report as "Aurum", the "Company" or as "we," "our," or "us."

We were incorporated in the State of Florida on September 29, 2008 under the name Liquid Financial Engines, Inc. ("Liquid") and we changed our name to Aurum, Inc. ("Aurum") and our State of domicile to the State of Delaware, effective as of January 20, 2010.
Description of Business
 
Background
 
Aurum, Inc. is an exploration stage company and was incorporated in Florida to initially develop and market financial software systems for banks, brokerage firms, pension funds, family offices, and hedge funds.
 
In July 2009, Golden Target Pty Ltd, an Australian corporation ("Golden") acquired a 96% interest in Aurum from Daniel McKelvey and certain other stockholders. Mr. McKelvey resigned as Sole Director and Officer of Aurum, Joseph Gutnick was appointed President, Chief Executive Officer and a Director and Peter Lee was appointed Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. In March 2011, the Company appointed Simon Lee as Chief Financial Officer. Peter Lee resigned as Chief Financial Officer but agreed to remain as Secretary. In June, 2011, the Company appointed Craig Michael as Chief Executive Officer and accepted his resignation in April 2012.
 
Commencing August 2009, the Company decided to focus on mineral exploration for gold and copper in the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic. The Company's planned operations have not commenced and are considered to be in the exploration stage.
 
On January 20, 2010, the Company re-incorporated in the State of Delaware (the "Reincorporation") through a merger involving Liquid Financial Engines, Inc. ("Liquid") and Aurum, Inc., a Delaware Corporation that was a wholly owned subsidiary of Liquid. The Reincorporation was effected by merging Liquid with Aurum, with Aurum being the surviving entity. For purposes of the Company's reporting status with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Aurum is deemed a successor to Liquid.
 
Strategy
 
Aurum is primarily engaged in mineral exploration for gold and copper in the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic (Lao P.D.R or Laos).
 
Based upon publicly available information and the experience of Company personnel, the Company believes that Laos has significant potential for gold and copper discoveries and is a highly under explored nation with respect to all mineral commodities. Laos has a long history of artisanal mining for gold and copper and numerous occurrences of these commodities have been recorded throughout the country. Only recently has Laos initiated a unified national geological and mineral resource knowledge database. The Laos government now sees the development of this knowledge combined with foreign investment into mineral exploration and development as integral to the future economy of Laos.
 
Current successful foreign owned mining operations in Laos, which are not affiliated with the Company, are the Sepon Copper Gold Mine in lower central Laos which produces approximately 65,000 tonnes of copper cathode and 100,000 ounces of gold per year and the Phu Kham mine in central northern Laos which is currently producing 60,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate and approximately 60,000 ounces of gold and 400,000 ounces of silver. Other smaller operations also exist throughout Laos as joint ventures between Laos and Vietnam or China.
 
Aurum considers Laos to be one of the few remaining countries in the world that has favourable geology in under explored areas containing high potential for world class undiscovered gold and copper ore bodies. Utilising this knowledge, in conjunction with management's prior experience in operating exploration logistics within Laos, has led the Company to pursue the many opportunities available in this country. Aurum has built significant relationships with the Lao government and local Lao contractors and is actively developing partnerships with these stakeholders. Relationships with these key stakeholders are considered integral for any successful mineral exploration venture in Laos.

Aurum has a registered representative office and an experienced mineral exploration team based in the capital city Vientiane. Exploration activities officially began in September 2009 and the Company has quickly rationalised target mineralisation styles for project generation and defined appropriate regions in which to stake mineral claims. The current exploration strategy is to target gold deposits which are ideally greater than 1 million ounces of gold, and copper deposits greater than 800,000 tonnes of contained copper. The following mineralisation styles have been targeted as the most prospective in Laos:


· | Sediment Hosted gold, Carlin Style gold, i.e. Sepon Mine, Laos. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Epithermal gold, i.e. Chatree Mine, Thailand. 
· | Granite Related, Hydrothermal/Mesothermal gold, i.e. Lak Sao area, Laos.
· | Skarn copper/gold, i.e. Phu Kham Mine, Laos. 
· | Supergene Exotic copper, i.e. Sepon Mine, Laos. 
· | Porphyry gold/copper/molybdenum, i.e. Sepon Mine, Laos. 



Recognition of the potential size of the resource endowment contained in the Loei-Luang Prabang belt (See Figure 1) is growing due to the recent history of major discoveries and mining developments by companies that Aurum is not affiliated with. On the Thailand side of the belt several prominent and highly profitable mining operations and feasibility stage projects are currently underway, including Kingsgate Consolidated's Ltd expanding Chatree gold mine and PanAust Ltd's Puthep Cu-Au deposit (See Figure 1).  On the Laos side, PanAust Ltd has two active mining operations, Phu Kham Cu-Au mine and Ban Houayxai Au mine, and an impressive portfolio of advanced stage exploration/resource projects. In addition to these major projects, there are numerous mineral occurrences with small scale mining operations all along the Loei-Luang Prabang belt. This list of significant resource and mine developments coupled with the highly underexplored nature of Laos highlights the exciting mineral potential of this region.
 
Corporate Developments
 
In December 2010, the Company executed a Management and Shareholders Agreement with Argonaut Overseas Investments Ltd ("AOI"), an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of Argonaut Resources N.L., in respect to Argonaut's 70% held, 55,105 acre Century Concession in Laos.
 
The agreement appoints Aurum as the manager of the Century Thrust Joint Venture Agreement, which currently exists between Argonaut and two other parties, and gives the Company the right to earn 72.86% of AOI's interest in the Joint Venture which is equivalent to a 51% beneficial interest in the Century Concession. In order to acquire this interest, Aurum may be required to spend US$6.5 million on exploration within five years.
 
On February 10, 2011, the Company entered into a Deed of Agreement with the shareholders of the Lao Inter Mining Options Ltd ("LIMO") which grants Aurum an option to purchase LIMO's 20% interest in the Joint Venture. This Agreement, in conjunction with the Management and Shareholders Agreement with AOI enables Aurum to acquire, at its option, a 71% beneficial interest in the Century Concession. In August 2011, the Company made the last option payment of $135,000. The Company had 60 days from the date of the last option payment to exercise the option to purchase 20% of the Joint Venture for $1.35 million, inclusive of the previously paid option fees of $405,000. On October 24, 2011, the Company executed a Deed of Variation of Call Option extending the exercise date of the Option to April 24, 2012, for consideration of $55,000 for each month extended.  The Company did not exercise the option due to delays in acquiring assay results and the time required to adequately assess the program.

Project Developments
 
The Century project is currently Aurum's flagship project and has been the focus of Aurum's exploration work this year. Aurum continues to generate other regional prospects in Laos and hopes to obtain exploration rights for these projects in the near future.
 
Century is located approximately 150 km north west of the capital city Vientiane on the highly prospective Loei-Luang Prabang fold belt, a prominent, regionally mineralized belt, which stretches from Thailand in the south, to Laos in the north (See Figure 1).
 
The permit for the Century Concession expired during the course of the 2013 fiscal year and the Company and AOI are currently going through the renewal process with Laos government.

At the time that Aurum entered into the Management and Shareholders Agreement with AOI in December 2010 Century was an advanced stage exploration project with four priority areas 'drill-ready' for early resource definition drilling. Numerous extremely encouraging high grade gold intersections, which had been reported by previous explorer Argonaut Resources NL, were ready for immediate follow up. A valuable, high quality geological database had been collected from multiple previous exploration programs involving soil sampling, pan concentrate sampling, stream sediment sampling, rock-chip sampling, topographic surveying, geological mapping, trenching, and drilling.

 Aurum prioritised this year's exploration efforts on the Century prospect areas of Nam Hone followed by Khohke, Ang Noi and Houay Khouay (See Figure 2). At Nam Hone an extensive 1,300 hole soil auger program is complete. This program has completed infill sampling across the full extent of the known gold in soil anomaly previously identified by Argonaut Resources NL and had been extended to the north with a total of 2,107 assay results collected. During 2011 an initial 8 hole diamond core drilling program, for a total of 2,435 metres, was completed at Nam Hone and a small 2 hole program, for a total of 330 metres was completed at Khohke. During 2012, geological logging, cutting, sampling and assaying of core was completed with 3,099 samples assayed by fire assay at the ALS facility in Vientiane. Four trenches for a total of 1,354 metres were completed, mapped and sampled at Nam Hone and have been incorporated into the detailed geochemistry at Nam Hone. All new and previous results are being incorporated into a preliminary estimate of mineralized material at Nam Hone. During 2013, interpretation and assessment of all results has enabled planning of further exploration programs for the 2013/14 dry season. This program is proposed to consist of drilling of the priority targets at the Nam Hone main zone. The aim of the drilling is to test the current structural model that is believed to be controlling the known gold mineralisation.
