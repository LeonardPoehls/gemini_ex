Item 1. Business
General
Libbey Inc. (Libbey or the Company) is a global leader in the design, production and sale of tableware and other products. We manufacture glass tableware and related products at our two plants in the United States as well as our plants located in Mexico (Libbey Mexico), the Netherlands (Libbey Holland), Portugal (Libbey Portugal) and China (Libbey China). We believe that our glass tableware manufacturing, distribution and service network is the largest in the Western Hemisphere and is among the largest in the world. We also source glass tableware, ceramic dinnerware, metal flatware, hollowware and serveware products globally. We sell our products in more than 100 countries across the globe. Our extensive line of tabletop and other products are sold globally under the Libbey®, Libbey Signature®, Masters Reserve®, World® Tableware, Syracuse® China, Crisa®, Royal Leerdam®, Crisal Glass® and other brand names primarily in the foodservice, retail and business-to-business channels. See note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for segment and geographic information.
Libbey was incorporated in Delaware in 1987, but traces its roots back to The W. L. Libbey & Son Company, an Ohio corporation formed in 1888, when it began operations in Toledo, Ohio.

Strategic Initiatives
Our strategy is focused on the following three key areas that we believe are critical to achieving sustainable, profitable growth across all our market segments: 

• | improving our capabilities in new product development and innovation to drive growth


• | getting closer to our customers and improving business relationships and


• | simplifying our business to become more competitive in a challenging global marketplace

In order to improve our capabilities to drive growth through innovation, we have augmented our marketing organization to drive enhanced market insight and established improved new product development capabilities.
In the U.S. and Canada we believe we have competitive advantages, including leading market share and best-in-class service in the foodservice channel.  We expect to extend these advantages by enhancing customer focus and introducing differentiated new products as we seek to increase our share in existing product categories, such as ceramic ware and metalware, and to extend our presence to an even broader range of foodservice venues than we have served historically. We are also an established foodservice supplier in the regions of Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, areas that we expect to benefit from our enhanced customer focus, new products and adjacencies tailored to increase share.

In the U.S. and Canada we are the casual glass beverageware leader in the retail channel and enjoy high brand recognition.  We are working to achieve improved competitive positioning given challenging industry trends. Our product innovation and planned digital capability enhancements will provide important support to our growth efforts. We seek to continue to increase our share and profitability of our core Mexican retail channel by leveraging our leading market position and superior brand portfolio. Retail is also an important channel for our EMEA business where we compete with well recognized brands.  
In the U.S. and Canada business-to-business channel, we are selectively developing supply relationships with customers in growing houseware product categories that include glass as a component such as candles, decorated beverageware and floral applications. This initiative extends beyond our global presence as a supplier of glassware that is decorated for promotions and our Latin American role as an OEM supplier to U.S. appliance manufacturers. 
In each of our markets, we are making significant strides in enhancing our customer focus and responsiveness. We are seeking customer feedback, providing more consistent engagement and spending increased time to better understand our customers' current and future needs.  
We are continuing our efforts to simplify our business and remove non-value-added complexity in order to improve profitability, cash generation and return on invested capital. To this end, we continue to focus on improving operating efficiencies, eliminating waste, reducing working capital and instilling a culture of continuous improvement in all aspects of our operations. For example, in 2016 we implemented a global product portfolio optimization initiative that included discontinuing under-performing stock-keeping units representing 20 percent of the global product portfolio. At the same time, we improved our product life-cycle management processes to improve the focus of our marketing teams and sales force and to reduce costs. In addition, we are reviewing our global production network for further opportunities to optimize our global network, reduce capital commitments and lower operating costs. 
We are on a mission to become more market-driven as we seek to transform into one of the most innovative tabletop companies.  In 2017, we will continue to create momentum executing on our growth, operational and organizational initiatives.
Products
Our products include glass tableware products that we produce at our six manufacturing facilities globally and glassware, ceramicware, metalware and other tabletop products that we source globally. Glass tableware products include products such as tumblers, stemware, mugs, bowls, vases, salt and pepper shakers, shot glasses, canisters, candleholders and other items. Other glass products include storageware, serveware, bakeware, handmade glass tableware and components sold to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), such as blender jars, mixing bowls and washing machine windows. We also offer a wide range of ceramic dinnerware products. These include plates, bowls, platters, cups, saucers and other tabletop accessories. In addition, we offer an extensive selection of metal flatware, including knives, forks, spoons and serving utensils, and metal hollowware, which includes such items as serving trays, pitchers and other metal tabletop accessories.
In recent years we have invested in proprietary ClearFire® technology at our Shreveport, Louisiana facility to manufacture premium glass tableware suitable for fine dining and other uses. We sell these products in the foodservice channel under the Masters Reserve® brand and in retail under the Libbey Signature® brand.
We have developed a complete premium tabletop offering called the Artistry Collection™ that is targeted to serve fine dining establishments and event venues in the foodservice channel. It combines our Masters Reserve® brand glassware with other leading brands of fine tabletop products sourced through the following exclusive distribution agreements:

• | Spiegelau and Nachtmann glassware and serveware products in the U.S. foodservice channel. Spiegelau is known for its fine stemware and other drinkware assortments. Nachtmann offers a variety of upscale serveware, decorative products, stemware and drinkware for finer dining establishments. 


• | Schönwald dinnerware products in the U.S. and Canada. Schönwald is one of the world's leading providers of high-end porcelain and bone china for food service. 


• | Reed & Barton flatware products in the U.S. and Canada. Reed & Barton is one of the oldest and largest privately-held tabletop and giftware companies.

Customers 
We believe that our regional market segment organization allows us to better understand and serve our customers' needs.
In the U.S. and Canada, customers for our tableware products include approximately 500 foodservice distributors in the United States and Canada and around the world who sell primarily to restaurants, bars, hotels and other foodservice venues. In retail, we sell to mass merchants, department stores, retail distributors, national retail chains and specialty housewares stores. Additionally, in the business-to-business channel, we sell to a variety of customers, including companies using glass in candle and floral applications.
In Latin America, we sell to retail customers including mass merchants and wholesale distributors; to a wide variety of business-to-business customers who use glass products in promotions, catalogues, candles, food packing and various OEM uses; and to foodservice distributors.
In EMEA, we sell glassware to retailers, distributors and decorators that service the retail, foodservice and business-to-business channels, including large breweries and distilleries decorating products with company logos for promotional and resale purposes.
We also sell products in the Asia Pacific region primarily to distributors and wholesalers.
No single customer accounts for 10 percent or more of our sales, although the loss of any of our major customers could have a meaningful effect on us.
Competition
The markets for our products are highly competitive in all our geographic segments. Our competitors include: other glass tableware manufacturers, including large multinational companies such as Arc International (a French company) and Paşabahçe (a unit of Şişecam Holdings, a Turkish company), the Oneida Group (a U.S. company), AnHui DeLi Glassware Co., Ltd. (a Chinese company), Vidrieria Y Cristaleria De Lamiaco, S.A.- VICRILA (a Spanish company) and various other manufacturers in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas; ceramic dinnerware and metalware manufacturers throughout the world, including Homer Laughlin, the Oneida Group, Steelite and others; and a variety of sourcing or marketing companies. In addition, other products such as plastic and melamine compete with our glass and ceramic tabletop products. The principal competitive factors are our installed base, customer service, price, product quality, new product development, brand name, responsiveness, delivery time and breadth of product offerings.

Softer global demand and industry overcapacity among tabletop product manufacturers have led to intensified price competition and irrational pricing behavior in all channels of our distribution. In the U.S., the relative strength of the dollar versus other world currencies has improved the ease with which foreign manufacturers can sell products into the U.S. at competitive prices.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution

In 2016, approximately 76 percent of our sales were to customers located in North America (U.S., Canada and Mexico) and approximately 24 percent of our sales were to customers in other countries. We sell our products in over 100 countries around the world. We employ our own sales force to call on customers and distributors. In addition, we occasionally retain the services of manufacturer's representative organizations to assist in selling our products. We have marketing staff located at our corporate headquarters in Toledo, Ohio, as well as in Mexico, Portugal, the Netherlands and China.
We operate distribution centers located at or near each of our manufacturing facilities (see “Properties” below). In addition, we operate a distribution center in Laredo, Texas, and one in West Chicago, Illinois. The glass tableware manufacturing and distribution centers are strategically located to facilitate supplying significant quantities of our product to customers on a timely and cost effective basis.
The majority of our sales are in the foodservice, retail and business-to-business channels, which are further detailed below.
Foodservice
We have, according to our estimates, the leading market share in glass tableware sales in the U.S. and Canadian foodservice channel, placing us among the leading tabletop suppliers across the globe. A majority of our tabletop sales to foodservice 
5

establishments are made through a network of foodservice distributors. Our strong foodservice distributor network and in-house sales force provide broad coverage of a wide variety of foodservice establishments including restaurants, bars, hotels and other travel and tourism venues.
Retail
Our primary customers in the retail channel include mass merchants, specialty housewares stores and value-oriented retailers in the U.S. and across the globe. Based on data from the Retail Tracking Services of NPD Group, we maintain the leading U.S. casual glass beverageware market share. We believe that our established relationships with major retailers, particularly in the U.S. and Canada, Latin America and EMEA, position us to successfully introduce differentiated new retail products to pursue increased share and profitability. We also operate outlet stores in the U.S. and Mexico and make sales via Internet retailers.
Business-to-Business
Libbey Holland and Libbey Portugal supply glass tableware to the business-to-business channel of distribution in Europe. Customers in this channel include marketers who decorate our glassware with company logos and resell these products to large breweries and distilleries, which redistribute the glassware for promotional purposes and resale. Our customers for products sold in the business-to-business channel in Latin America and the U.S. and Canada include drink companies and custom decorators of glassware for promotional purposes and resale. Additionally, our products sold in the business-to-business channel include products for candle and floral applications, blender jars and washing machine windows. The craft industries and gourmet food-packing companies are also among our business-to-business glassware consumers.
Seasonality
Our sales and operating income tend to be stronger in the last three quarters of each year and weaker in the first quarter of each year, primarily due to the impact of consumer buying patterns and production activity. This seasonal pattern causes accounts receivable to be higher in the second half of the year and lower during the first half of the year.
We typically build inventory during the first half of the year to allow for optimum customer service and timely delivery in the second half of the year, a higher demand period when orders may exceed short-term production capabilities. We also build inventory to service customers during periods of planned downtime for furnace rebuilds or maintenance. Accounts payable do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis.
Although little information with respect to our competitors is publicly available, we believe that our experience with working capital is generally consistent with the experience of the industry as a whole.
Backlog
As of December 31, 2016, our backlog was approximately $89.7 million, compared to approximately $92.7 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to currency translation effects and reduced order backlog for our retail channel. Backlog includes orders confirmed with a purchase order for products scheduled to be shipped to customers in a future period. Because orders may be changed and/or canceled, we do not believe that our backlog is necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future period and expect that the majority of these orders will be fulfilled within the current year.
Manufacturing and Sourcing
In North America, we currently own and operate three glass tableware manufacturing plants, two of which are located in the United States (one in Toledo, Ohio, and one in Shreveport, Louisiana) and one of which is located in Monterrey, Mexico. In Europe, we own and operate two glass tableware manufacturing plants, one of which is located in Leerdam, the Netherlands, and the other of which is located in Marinha Grande, Portugal. In Asia, we own and operate a glass tableware production facility in Langfang, China.
The manufacture of our tableware products involves the use of automated processes and technologies, as well as manual production. We design much of our glass tableware production machinery, and we continuously refine it to incorporate technological advances to create a competitive advantage. We believe that our production machinery and equipment continue to be adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future, but we continue to invest to further improve our products, gain production efficiencies and reduce our cost profile.

Our glass tableware products generally are produced using one of two manufacturing methods, commonly referred to as "blown" or "pressed". In the case of certain stemware, we may use a combination of these methods. Most of our tumblers, stemware and other glass tableware products are "blown", meaning that they are produced by forming molten glass in molds with the use of compressed air. Our other glass tableware products and the stems of certain stemware are “pressed”, meaning that they are produced by pressing molten glass into the desired product shape.
To assist in the manufacturing process, we employ a team of engineers whose responsibilities include efforts to improve and upgrade our manufacturing facilities, equipment and processes. In addition, they provide engineering required to manufacture new products and implement the large number of innovative changes continuously being made to our product designs, sizes and shapes. See “Research and Development” below for additional information.
Ceramic dinnerware and metal flatware and hollowware are sourced primarily from the Asia Pacific region.
Materials
Our primary materials are sand, lime, soda ash, corrugated packaging and colorants. Historically, these materials have been available in adequate supply from multiple sources. However, there may be temporary shortages of certain materials due to weather or other factors, including disruptions in supply caused by material transportation or production delays. Such shortages have not had, and are not expected in the future to have, a material adverse effect on our operations. Natural gas is the primary source of energy in our production processes, and periodic variability in the price for natural gas has had and could continue to have an impact on our profitability. Historically, we have used natural gas hedging for a portion of our expected purchases to partially mitigate this impact in North America and Europe. We also experience fluctuations in the freight cost to deliver materials due primarily to the cost of diesel fuel to our facilities, and such changes may affect our earnings and cash flow.
Research and Development 
Our research and development efforts focus on developing new, differentiated and innovative products to meet customers' and consumers’ needs. Our product development efforts begin with consumer insights, and we have been investing to strengthen these capabilities. Our focus is to increase the quality of our products, develop innovative new product offerings and enhance the profitability of our business through research and development, including adjacent technology, safety and risk mitigation techniques. We will continue to invest in strategic research and development projects that will further enhance our ability to compete in our core business.
In addition, our core competencies include our glass engineering excellence and world-class manufacturing development techniques. We employ a team of engineers, in addition to external consultants and university collaboration studies in sciences, to conduct research and development. Our expenditures on research and development activities related to new and/or improved products and processes were $4.3 million, $6.1 million and $6.2 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These costs were expensed as incurred.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
Based upon market research and surveys, we believe that our trade names and trademarks, as well as our product shapes and styles, enjoy a high degree of consumer recognition and are valuable assets. We believe that the Libbey®, Libbey Signature®, Masters Reserve®, Syracuse® China, World® Tableware, Crisa®, Royal Leerdam® and Crisal Glass® trade names and trademarks are material to our business.
We have rights under a number of patents that relate to a variety of products and processes. However, we do not consider that any patent or group of patents relating to a particular product or process is of material importance to our business as a whole.
Environmental Matters
Our operations, in common with those of industry generally, are subject to numerous existing laws and governmental regulations designed to protect the environment, particularly regarding plant waste, emissions and solid waste disposal and remediation of contaminated sites. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, and we are not aware of any regulatory initiatives that we expect will have a material effect on our products or operations. See “Risk Factors-We are subject to various environmental legal requirements and may be subject to new legal requirements in the future; these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations.”

We have shipped, and we continue to ship, waste materials for off-site disposal. However, we are not named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any waste disposal site matters pending prior to June 24, 1993, the date of Libbey's initial public offering and separation from Owens-Illinois, Inc. (Owens-Illinois). Owens-Illinois has been named as a potentially responsible party or other participant in connection with certain waste disposal sites to which we also may have shipped wastes prior to June 24, 1993. We may bear some responsibility in connection with those shipments. Pursuant to an indemnification agreement between Owens-Illinois and Libbey, Owens-Illinois agreed to defend and hold us harmless against any costs or liabilities we may incur in connection with any such matters identified and pending as of June 24, 1993, and to indemnify us for any liability that results from these matters in excess of $3.0 million. 
Syracuse China Environmental Matters
On October 10, 1995, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, or APA, Syracuse China Company, our wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired from The Pfaltzgraff Co. (now known as TPC York, Inc., which we refer to as "TPC York") and certain of its subsidiary corporations, the assets operated by them as Syracuse China.
By letter dated October 31, 2008, the DEC and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which we refer to as the EPA, made a demand upon Syracuse China and several other potentially responsible parties, or "PRPs," for recovery of approximately $12.5 million of direct and indirect costs allegedly expended by the DEC and EPA in connection with the lake bottom subsite (which we refer to as the Onondaga Lake Bottom subsite) of the Onondaga Lake Superfund Site. In February 2013, Syracuse China, TPC York and Honeywell International Inc., which we refer to as Honeywell, entered into an agreement to settle certain claims relating to the Onondaga Lake Bottom subsite, which Honeywell previously undertook to remediate. Under that Settlement Agreement, Honeywell has agreed to indemnify Syracuse China with respect to certain claims that may be made by any government or third party with respect to the Onondaga Lake Bottom subsite.

By letter dated October 30, 2009, the EPA notified Syracuse China and several other PRPs of potential liability for response costs in connection with the Lower Ley Creek subsite ("Ley Creek Subsite") of the Onondaga Lake Superfund Site. Since that date, the EPA has completed its Remedial Investigation (RI), Feasibility Study (FS), Risk Assessment (RA) and Proposed Remedial Action Plan (PRAP). The EPA issued its Record of Decision (RoD) on September 30, 2014. The RoD indicates that the EPA's estimate of the undiscounted cost of remediation ranges between approximately $17.0 million (assuming local disposal of contaminated sediments is feasible) and approximately $24.8 million (assuming local disposal is not feasible). However, the RoD acknowledges that the final cost of the cleanup will depend upon the actual volume of contaminated material, the degree to which it is contaminated, and where the excavated soil and sediment is properly disposed. In connection with the General Motors Corporation bankruptcy, the EPA recovered $22.0 million (which we refer to as the "GM Settlement Funds") from Motors Liquidation Company ("MLC"), the successor to General Motors Corporation. If the cleanup costs do not exceed the amount recovered by the EPA from MLC, Syracuse China may suffer no loss. If and to the extent the cleanup costs exceed the amount recovered by the EPA from MLC, it is not yet known whether other PRPs will be added to the current group of PRPs or how any excess costs may be allocated among the PRPs. 
On March 3, 2015, the EPA issued to the PRPs notices and requests to negotiate performance of the remedial design (RD), work. The notices contemplate that any agreement to perform the RD work would be memorialized in an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC). On July 14, 2016, the PRPs entered into an AOC to perform the RD work. The EPA and PRPs anticipate that the RD work will produce additional information from which the feasibility of a local disposal option and the cleanup costs can be better determined. The EPA has declined to advance the GM Settlement Funds for the RD work, instead conditioning use of those funds to reimburse for the RD work upon the successful completion of the RD work and the finalization of an AOC to perform the remedial action work.
To the extent Syracuse China is liable for any costs in connection with the remediation of the Ley Creek Subsite, including without limitation costs to fund the RD work, and to the extent such costs are not reimbursed from the GM Settlement Funds, then pursuant to the APA Syracuse China and TPC York will share such costs up to an aggregate of $7.5 million. We believe that collection of the amounts for which TPC York is liable under that indemnification is probable.
In connection with the above proceedings, an estimated environmental liability of $0.9 million and a recoverable amount of $0.5 million in other long term assets have been recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016. An estimated liability of $1.1 million and a recoverable amount of $0.6 million in other long term assets have been recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015. An immaterial amount, $0.2 million and $0.3 million have been recorded in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding, we believe that it will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
8

Other
We regularly review the facts and circumstances of the various environmental matters affecting us, including those covered by indemnification. Although not free of uncertainties, we do not expect, based upon the number of parties involved at the sites and the estimated cost, based upon known technology and the experience of others, of undisputed work necessary for remediation, to incur material loss for new matters in the future. There can be no assurance, however, that indemnification agreements will be performed in accordance with their terms. We believe that any future expenditures for environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
In addition, occasionally the federal government and various state authorities have investigated possible health issues that may arise from the use of lead or other ingredients in enamels such as those used on the exterior surface of our decorated products. In that connection, Libbey Glass Inc. and numerous other glass tableware manufacturers, distributors and importers entered into a consent judgment on August 31, 2004 in connection with an action, Leeman v. Arc International North America, Inc. et al, Case No. CGC-003-418025 (Superior Court of California, San Francisco County) brought under California's so-called “Proposition 65.” Proposition 65 requires businesses with ten or more employees to give a “clear and reasonable warning” prior to exposing any person to a detectable amount of a chemical listed by the state as covered by this statute. Lead is one of the chemicals covered by that statute. Pursuant to the consent judgment, Libbey Glass Inc. and the other defendants (including Anchor Hocking and Arc International North America, Inc.) agreed, over a period of time, to reformulate the enamels used to decorate the external surface of certain glass tableware items to reduce the lead content of those enamels. To the extent applicable to our products, we comply with these requirements.
Although we continue to modify our manufacturing processes and technologies in an effort to reduce our emissions and increase energy efficiency, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment for environmental control activities were not material during 2016 or 2015 and are not expected to increase significantly in 2017.
Employees
We employed 6,237 persons at December 31, 2016. Approximately 71 percent of our employees are employed outside the U.S. The majority of our employees are paid hourly and covered by collective bargaining agreements. The total number of employees under a collective bargaining agreement expiring within one year is approximately 12 percent of Libbey's total workforce. Our collective bargaining agreements with unionized employees expire on June 30, 2017 in the Netherlands; December 15, 2017 in Shreveport, Louisiana; and September 30, 2019 in Toledo, Ohio. In Mexico collective bargaining agreements have no expiration, but wages are reviewed annually and benefits every two years. In Portugal and China we have no written collective bargaining agreement with our unionized employees, but there are consultations with the unions on various matters. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
