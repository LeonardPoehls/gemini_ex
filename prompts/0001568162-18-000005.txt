Item 1. Business.
We are a diversified REIT with a retail focus. We own a diversified portfolio of commercial properties which are net leased primarily to investment grade and other creditworthy tenants and, as a result of the Mergers (as defined below), a portfolio of retail properties consisting primarily of power centers and lifestyle centers. Prior to the Mergers, we acquired a diversified portfolio of commercial properties comprised primarily of freestanding single-tenant properties that are net leased to investment grade and other creditworthy tenants. We intend to focus our future acquisitions primarily on net leased retail properties. As of December 31, 2017, we owned 540 properties with an aggregate purchase price of $3.4 billion, comprised of 19.4 million rentable square feet, which were 95.2% leased, including 505 of net leased commercial properties (465 which are retail properties) and 35 retail properties which were acquired in the Mergers that are not net leased. 
Incorporated on January 22, 2013, we are a Maryland corporation that elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Substantially all of our business is conducted through American Finance Operating Partnership, L.P. (the “OP”), a Delaware limited partnership, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
On April 4, 2013, we commenced our initial public offering (the “IPO”) on a “reasonable best efforts” basis of up to 68.0 million shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at a price of $25.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts. The IPO closed in October 2013. As of December 31, 2017, we had 105.2 million shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares and shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (the “DRIP”), and had received total proceeds from the IPO and the DRIP, net of share repurchases, of $1.7 billion. In 2017, we issued approximately 38.2 million shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger.
On March 17, 2017, our board of directors approved an estimated net asset value per share of our common stock (“Estimated Per-Share NAV”) equal to $23.37 as of December 31, 2016, which was published on March 20, 2017. We intend to publish an updated Estimated Per-Share NAV as of December 31, 2017 shortly following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, thereafter, periodically at the discretion of the Board, provided that such estimates will be made at least once annually.
We have no employees. We have retained the Advisor to manage our affairs on a day-to-day basis. American Finance Properties, LLC (the “Property Manager”) serves as our property manager. The Advisor and the Property Manager are wholly owned subsidiaries of AR Global, as a result of which, they are related parties of ours, and each have received or may receive, as applicable, compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for services related to managing our business. Lincoln and its affiliates provide services to the Advisor in connection with our retail properties acquired in the Mergers that are not net leased.
On August 8, 2017, our application to list our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “AFIN” (the “Listing”), was approved by NASDAQ subject to our being in compliance with all applicable listing standards on the date our common stock begins trading on NASDAQ. While we intend to list our common stock at a time yet to be determined by our board of directors, there can be no assurance as to when or if our common stock will commence trading or of the price at which our common stock may trade.
Completed Mergers
American Realty Capital — Retail Centers of America, Inc. Merger
On February 16, 2017, the Company and the OP completed (a) the merger of American Realty Capital — Retail Centers of America, Inc. (“RCA”) with and into a subsidiary of the Company referred to as the “Merger Sub,” with the Merger Sub surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”) and (b) the merger of American Realty Capital Retail Operating Partnership, L.P. (the “RCA OP”) with and into the OP, with the OP as the surviving entity (the “Partnership Merger”, and together with the Merger, the “Mergers”). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) entered into by the Company and the OP with RCA, the RCA OP and the Merger Sub, at the effective time of the Mergers on February 16, 2017 (the “Effective Time”), each outstanding share of common stock of RCA, $0.01 par value per share (“RCA Common Stock”) (including any restricted shares of RCA Common Stock and fractional shares), was converted into (x) 0.385 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Stock Consideration”) and (y) cash from the Company, in an amount equal to $0.95 per share (the “Cash Consideration,” and together with the Stock Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”).
1

In addition, at the Effective Time, (i) each unit of partnership interest of the RCA OP designated as an OP unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than those held by RCA as described in clause (ii) below) was automatically converted into 0.424 validly issued units of limited partnership interest of the OP (the “Partnership Merger Consideration”); (ii) each unit of partnership interest of the RCA OP designated as either an OP unit or a GP unit held by RCA and issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was automatically converted into 0.385 validly issued units of limited partnership interest of the OP; (iii) each unit of partnership interest of the RCA OP designated as a Class B Unit held by RCA’s advisor and a sub- advisor issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into the Partnership Merger Consideration (the “Class B Consideration,” and together with the Partnership Merger Consideration and the Merger Consideration, the “Total Merger Consideration”), and (iv) the interest of American Realty Capital Retail Advisor, LLC, the special limited partner of the RCA OP (the “RCA Advisor”), in the RCA OP was redeemed for a cash payment, determined in accordance with the existing terms of the RCA OP’s agreement of limited partnership.
In addition, as provided in the Merger Agreement, all outstanding restricted shares of RCA Common Stock previously issued by RCA became fully vested and entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. 
In 2017, we issued approximately 38.2 million shares of our common stock as consideration in the Merger and paid approximately $94.5 million as Cash Consideration.
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the OP entered into a binding commitment, pursuant to which UBS Securities LLC, UBS AG, Stamford Branch and Citizens Bank, N.A. have committed to provide a $360.0 million bridge loan facility, subject to customary conditions. We did not borrow any funds under the bridge loan facility.
Prior to the Merger, the Company and RCA each were sponsored, directly or indirectly, by AR Global. AR Global and its affiliates provide investment and advisory services to us, and previously provided such services to RCA, pursuant to written advisory agreements. In 2017, in connection with, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, RCA OP units held by AR Global and its affiliates were exchanged for OP Units of the Company and certain special limited partner interests in the RCA OP held by AR Global and its affiliates were, consistent with the terms of the RCA OP partnership agreement, redeemed for a cash payment of approximately $2.8 million.
In addition, on February 16, 2017, we, the OP, and certain other subsidiaries of ours acting as guarantors, entered into an amendment, assumption, joinder and reaffirmation of guaranties to an unsecured amended and restated credit agreement, dated December 2, 2014, by and among the RCA OP to which the OP is successor by merger, BMO Harris Bank N.A., as administrative agent, letter of credit issuer, swingline lender and a lender, and the other parties thereto, relating to a revolving credit facility (the “Amended Credit Facility”).
The Advisor informed us that the Advisor engaged Lincoln as an independent service provider to provide real estate-related services similar to the services provided by Lincoln to the RCA Advisor prior to the Effective Time. Lincoln will continue to provide, subject to the Advisor’s or its affiliates’ oversight, asset management, property management and leasing services for those multi-tenant properties acquired by the Company from RCA in the Mergers. The Advisor informed us that the Advisor agreed to pass through to Lincoln a portion of the fees and/or other expense reimbursements otherwise payable to the Advisor or its affiliates by the Company for services rendered by Lincoln. We have no direct obligation to Lincoln.
Acquisitions and Dispositions
In addition to the properties acquired in the Mergers, we have acquired 75 net leased commercial properties during the year ended December 31, 2017 for an aggregate contract price of $149.2 million, comprised of 0.6 million rentable square feet. These acquisitions were funded through a combination of mortgage debt, draws on the Amended Credit Facility, proceeds from dispositions of properties and available cash on hand.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we closed on the sale of 25 properties, including 18 properties operated by SunTrust, for an aggregate contract price of $291.5 million, excluding closing related costs. In connection with these sales, we repaid $103.0 million of mortgage debt, leaving net proceeds available for other uses of $188.5 million. 
Investment Objectives
We seek to preserve and protect capital, provide attractive and stable cash distributions and increase the value of our assets in order to generate capital appreciation by using the following strategies:

• | Retail Focused Portfolio, Including Single-Tenant Net Leased Properties — Acquiring freestanding single-tenant properties net leased to investment grade and other creditworthy tenants, which are expected to primarily consist of retail properties; however, we will not forgo opportunities to invest in other types of real estate investments that meet our overall investment objectives;


• | Long-Term Leases — With respect to net leased properties, enter into long-term leases with minimum, non-cancelable lease terms of ten or more years;

2


• | Low Leverage — Finance our portfolio opportunistically (taking advantage of opportunities as they arise) at a target leverage level of not more than 45% loan-to-value. Loan to value ratio is a lending risk assessment ratio that is examined before approving a mortgage and is calculated by dividing the mortgage amount by the appraised value of the property; and


• | Diversified Portfolio — Assemble, manage and optimize a well diversified portfolio based on geography, tenant diversity, lease expirations, and other factors.

In addition, the Company may, at its discretion, originate and acquire commercial real estate debt investments. 
Acquisition and Investment Policies
Real Estate Investment Focus
We own a diversified portfolio with a retail focus comprised of commercial properties which are net leased primarily to investment grade and other creditworthy tenants and, as a result of the Mergers, a portfolio of retail properties, consisting primarily of power centers and lifestyle centers.
Our investment objectives are (a) to provide current income for investors through the payment of cash distributions and (b) to preserve and return investors’ capital and to maximize risk-adjusted returns. We do not expect to make investments outside of the United States.
There is no limitation on the number, size or type of properties that we may acquire. The number and mix of properties depend upon real estate market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time of acquisition of properties. 
Investing in Real Property 
We consider relevant real estate and financial factors when evaluating prospective investments in real property, including the location of the property, the leases and other agreements affecting the property, the creditworthiness of major tenants, its income-producing capacity, its physical condition, its prospects for appreciation, its prospects for liquidity, tax considerations and other factors. Our Advisor has substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific investments, subject to board approval. 
The following table lists the tenants (including, for this purpose, all affiliates of such tenants) from which we derive annualized rental income on a straight-line basis constituting 5.0% or more of our consolidated annualized rental income on a straight-line basis for all portfolio properties as of December 31, 2017:

Tenant | December 31, 2017
SunTrust Bank | 11.2% 
Sanofi US | 7.1% 
AmeriCold | 5.3% 

Acquisition Structure
To date, we have acquired fee interests (a “fee interest” is the absolute, legal possession and ownership of land, property, or rights) and leasehold interests (a “leasehold interest” is a right to enjoy the exclusive possession and use of an asset or property for a stated definite period as created by a written lease) in properties. We anticipate continuing to do so if we acquire properties in the future, although other methods of acquiring a property may be utilized if we deem it to be advantageous. For example, we may acquire properties through a joint venture or the acquisition of substantially all of the interests of an entity which in turn owns the real property.
International Investments
We do not intend to invest in real estate outside of the United States or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or make other real estate investments related to assets located outside of the United States. 
Development and Construction of Properties 
We do not intend to acquire undeveloped land, develop new properties, or substantially redevelop existing properties. 
Joint Ventures 
We may enter into joint ventures, partnerships and other co-ownership arrangements (including preferred equity investments) for the purpose of making investments. Some of the potential reasons to enter into a joint venture would be to acquire assets we could not otherwise acquire, to reduce our capital commitment to a particular asset, or to benefit from certain expertise that a partner might have.
3

Our general policy is to invest in joint ventures only when we will have a right of first refusal to purchase the co-venturer’s interest in the joint venture if the co-venturer elects to sell such interest. If the co-venturer elects to sell property held in any such joint venture, however, we may not have sufficient funds to exercise our right of first refusal to buy the other co-venturer’s interest in the property held by the joint venture. If any joint venture with an affiliated entity holds interests in more than one property, the interest in each such property may be specifically allocated based upon the respective proportion of funds invested by each co-venturer in each such property. 
Financing Strategies and Policies 
We may obtain financing for acquisitions and investments at the time an asset is acquired or an investment is made, or at a later time. In addition, debt financing may be used from time to time for property improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other working capital needs. The form of our indebtedness for future financings will vary and could be long-term or short-term, secured or unsecured, or fixed-rate or floating rate. We will not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements for speculative purposes but may do so in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risks on variable rate debt. We expect to be able to secure various forms of fixed- and floating-rate debt financing, including mortgage financing secured by our portfolio, collateralized loan obligation issuances and bank financing.
We will not borrow from our Advisor or its affiliates unless a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction approves the transaction as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable and no less favorable to us than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties. 
We may reevaluate and change our financing policies without a stockholder vote. Factors that we would consider when reevaluating or changing our debt policy include: then-current economic conditions, the relative cost and availability of debt and equity capital, our expected investment opportunities, the ability of our investments to generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service requirements and other similar factors. 
Tax Status
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT. In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)), determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties, and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law by the U.S. President. We are not aware of any provision in the final tax reform legislation or any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a REIT or to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, new legislation, as well as new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions may be introduced, enacted, or promulgated from time to time, that could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is adverse to our qualification as a REIT.
Competition
The net leased property and retail real estate markets are highly competitive. We compete for tenants in all of our markets with other owners and operators of retail real estate. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property’s design to prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties. 
4

In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire and to locate tenants and purchasers for our properties. These competitors include Global Net Lease, Inc. (“GNL”). a REIT sponsored by an affiliate of AR Global, with an investment strategy similar to our investment strategy, other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. There are also other REITs with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours and others may be organized in the future. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants. In addition, these same entities and our Company seek financing through similar channels. Therefore, we compete for financing in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease. 
Competition from these and other third party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us. It also may result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms. 
Regulations 
Our investments are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments. 
Environmental 
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future. We hire third parties to conduct Phase I environmental reviews of the real property that we intend to purchase. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had no employees. The employees of the Advisor and other entities under common control with our Sponsor perform a full range of real estate services for us, including acquisitions, property management, accounting, legal, asset management, wholesale brokerage and investor relations services. 
We are dependent on these companies for services that are essential to us, including asset acquisition decisions, property management and other general administrative responsibilities. In the event that any of these companies were unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to provide such services ourselves or obtain such services from other sources. 
Financial Information About Industry Segments 
Our current business consists of owning, managing, operating, leasing, acquiring, investing in and disposing of real estate assets. Substantially all of our consolidated revenues are from our consolidated real estate properties. We internally evaluate operating performance on an individual property level and view all of our real estate assets as one industry segment, and, accordingly, all of our properties are aggregated into one reportable segment. Our CRE Debt Investments, in aggregate, do not meet any of the consolidated quantitative thresholds that would require us to present their information separately, and thus we do not consider our CRE Debt Investments to be a reportable segment.
