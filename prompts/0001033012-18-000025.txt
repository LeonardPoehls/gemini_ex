ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Where we say "we," "us," "our," the "Company," "Bancorp" or "Flagstar," we usually mean Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. However, in some cases, a reference to "we," "us," or "our," the "Company," or "Flagstar," will include our wholly-owned subsidiary Flagstar Bank, FSB (the "Bank"). See the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms on page 3 for definitions used throughout this Form 10-K.    
Introduction
We are a leading savings and loan holding company founded in 1993. Our business is primarily conducted through our principal subsidiary, the Bank, a federally chartered stock savings bank founded in 1987. Based on our assets at December 31, 2017, we are one of the largest banks headquartered in Michigan, providing commercial, small business, and consumer banking services, and the 5th largest bank mortgage originator in the nation. At December 31, 2017, we had 3,525 full-time equivalent employees inclusive of account executives and loan officers. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol "FBC." As of December 31, 2017, we are considered a controlled company for NYSE purposes, because approximately 62.1 percent of our common stock is owned by MP Thrift Investments, L.P., which is managed by MatlinPatterson, a global asset manager.
We have a unique, relationship-based business model which leverages our full-service bank’s capabilities with our national mortgage customer base to create and build enduring commercial relationships. Our banking network emphasizes the delivery of a complete set of banking and mortgage products and services. We distinguish ourselves by crafting specialized solutions for our customers, local delivery, high quality customer service and competitive product pricing. Our community bank growth model has focused on attracting seasoned bankers with larger bank lending experience who can attract their existing long-term customer relationships to Flagstar. At December 31, 2017, we operated 99 full service banking branches throughout Michigan's major markets where we offer a full set of banking products to consumer, commercial, and government customers. 
We originate mortgages through a wholesale network of correspondents and brokers in all 50 states, as well as through our own loan officers from 89 retail locations in 29 states, representing the combined retail branches of Flagstar Bank, our direct-to-consumer lending team and the Opes Advisors mortgage division. The Bank has the opportunity to expand correspondent relationships by providing warehouse lending, mortgage servicing and other services. Servicing and subservicing of loans provides fee income and generates a stable long-term source of funding through company controlled deposits.
We believe our transformation into a strong commercial bank, our flexible mortgage servicing platform, and focus on service creates a significant competitive advantage in the markets in which we compete. The management team we have assembled is focused on developing substantial and attractive growth opportunities that generate profitable results from operations. We believe our lower risk profile and strong capital level position us to take advantage of opportunities to deliver attractive shareholder returns over the long term.
Operating Segments
Our operations are conducted through our three operating segments: Community Banking, Mortgage Originations and Mortgage Servicing. Additionally, our Other segment includes the remaining reported activities. For further information, see MD&A - Operating Segments and Note 23 - Segment Information.
Competition
We face substantial competition in attracting deposits and making loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from other savings banks, commercial banks and credit unions in our local market areas. Money market funds and full-service securities brokerage firms also compete with us for these funds and, in recent years, many financial institutions have competed for deposits through the Internet. We compete for deposits by offering competitive interest rates and a broad range of high quality customized banking services at a large number of convenient locations. From a lending perspective, there are many institutions including commercial banks, national mortgage lenders, local savings banks, credit unions, and commercial lenders offering mortgage loans, consumer loans, commercial loans and warehouse loans. With respect to those products that we offer, we compete by offering competitive interest rates, fees, and other loan terms through efficient and customized service.

Subsidiaries
At December 31, 2017, our corporate structure consisted of the Bank subsidiary and its wholly-owned subsidiaries along with our wholly-owned non-bank subsidiaries through which we conduct other non-material business or which are inactive. The Bank and its wholly owned subsidiaries comprised 99.7 percent of our total assets at December 31, 2017. For further information, see Note 1 - Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Standards, Note 7 - Variable Interest Entities and Note 24 - Holding Company Only Financial Statements.
Regulation and Supervision
We are subject to regulation under state and federal laws. Regulatory reform and enhanced supervisory requirements have had and could continue to have an impact on how we conduct business. As a result, we continually assess the impact of regulatory changes and implement policies, processes and controls required to comply with new regulations.
As a result of scrutiny and regulation of the banking industry and consumer practices, we may face a greater number or wider scope of examinations, investigations, enforcement actions and litigation, thereby increasing our costs associated with responding to or defending such actions, as well as potentially resulting in costs associated with fines, penalties, settlements or judgments. Additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our businesses, and any required changes resulting from these developments, could reduce our revenue, limit the products or services that we offer or increase the costs thereof, impose additional compliance costs, harm our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. Some of these laws may provide a private right of action allowing a consumer or class of consumers to seek to enforce these laws and regulations.
Both the OCC and the FDIC may take regulatory enforcement actions against any of their regulated institutions that do not operate in accordance with applicable regulations, policies and directives. Proceedings may be instituted against any banking institution, or any "institution-affiliated party," such as a director, officer, employee, agent or controlling person, who engages in unsafe and unsound practices, including violations of applicable laws and regulations. The OCC has authority under various circumstances to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured institution that it regulates, to issue cease and desist orders, to obtain injunctions restraining or prohibiting unsafe or unsound practices, to revalue assets and to require the establishment of reserves. The FDIC has additional authority to terminate insurance of accounts, after notice and hearing, upon a finding that the insured institution is or has engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice that has not been corrected, is operating in an unsafe or unsound condition or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, or order of, or condition imposed by, the FDIC. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the CFPB may have the authority to take regulatory enforcement actions against us or the Bank.
Compliance obligations have exposed us, and will continue to expose us, to additional compliance risks and could divert management’s focus from our business operations. Furthermore, the combined effect of numerous rulemakings by multiple governmental agencies and regulators, and the potential conflicts or inconsistencies among such rules, present challenges and risks to our business and operations. Changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies, cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results. 
Consent Orders and Supervisory Agreements
Supervisory Agreement. On January 28, 2010, we became subject to a supervisory agreement with the Federal Reserve ("the Supervisory Agreement"), which will remain in effect until terminated, modified, or suspended in writing by the Federal Reserve. The failure to comply with the Supervisory Agreement could result in the initiation of further enforcement action by the Federal Reserve, including the imposition of further operating restrictions, and could result in additional enforcement actions against us. We have taken actions which we believe are appropriate to comply with, and intend to maintain compliance with, all of the requirements of the Supervisory Agreement. For further information and a complete description of all of the terms of the Supervisory Agreement, please refer to the copy of the Supervisory Agreement filed with the SEC as an exhibit to our 2016 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Consent Order with CFPB. On September 29, 2014, the Bank entered into a Consent Order with the CFPB ("the Consent Order") which will remain in effect for five years unless extended by the CFPB. The Consent Order relates to alleged violations of federal consumer financial laws arising from the Bank’s residential first mortgage loan loss mitigation practices and default servicing operations dating back to 2011. Under the terms of the Consent Order, the Bank paid $28 million for borrower remediation and $10 million in civil money penalties. The settlement did not include an admission of wrongdoing on the part of the Bank or its employees, directors, officers, or agents. For further information and a complete description of all of

the terms of the Consent Order, please refer to the copy of the Consent Order filed with the SEC as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 29, 2014.
Holding Company Regulation
The Company is a savings and loan holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve and the SEC.
Acquisition, Activities and Change in Control. We are a unitary savings and loan holding company, as defined by federal banking law, as is our controlling stockholder, MP Thrift. We may only conduct, or acquire control of companies engaged in, activities permissible for a savings and loan holding company pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Home Owners' Loan Act and relevant regulations. Without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve, neither we, nor MP Thrift may: (i) acquire control of another savings association or holding company thereof, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets thereof; or (ii) acquire or retain, with certain exceptions, more than 5 percent of the voting shares of a non-subsidiary savings association or a non-subsidiary savings and loan holding company. We are prohibited from acquiring control of a depository institution that is not federally insured or retaining control of a savings association subsidiary for more than one year after the date that such subsidiary becomes uninsured. Similarly, we may not be acquired by a bank holding company, a savings and loan holding company, or any company, unless the Federal Reserve approves such transaction. In addition, the GLBA generally restricts a company from acquiring us if that company is engaged directly or indirectly in activities that are not permissible for a savings and loan holding company or financial holding company.
Limitation on Capital Distributions. Under the Supervisory Agreement, we may not declare or pay any cash dividends or other capital distributions or purchase, repurchase, or redeem, or commit to purchase, repurchase, or redeem any equity stock without the prior written non-objection of the Federal Reserve. The Company does not currently pay dividends, or repurchase or redeem its equity.
Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and/or sponsoring certain "covered funds," including hedge funds and private equity funds. The statutory provision is commonly referred to as the "Volcker Rule." Pursuant to the requirements of the Volcker Rule, we have established a standard compliance program based on the size and complexity of our operations.

Basel III Capital Requirements. The Bank and Flagstar are currently subject to the regulatory capital framework and guidelines reached by Basel III as adopted by the OCC and Federal Reserve. The OCC and Federal Reserve have risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to measure capital adequacy with regard to a banking organization’s balance sheet, including off-balance sheet exposures such as unused portions of loan commitments, letters of credit, and recourse arrangements. 
The Bank and Flagstar have been subject to the capital requirements of the Basel III rules since January 1, 2015. On October 27, 2017, the agencies published a proposed rule to simplify certain aspects of the capital rules, which includes proposed simplifications to the capital treatment for items covered by this final rule. The agencies expect that the capital treatment and transition provisions for items covered by Basel III rules will change once the simplification proposal is finalized and effective. On November 21, 2017, in preparation for forthcoming rules that would simplify regulatory capital requirements to reduce regulatory burden, federal banking regulators approved the extension of the existing transitional capital treatment for certain regulatory capital deductions and risk weights. For additional information, see Note 20 - Regulatory Capital.
Stress Testing Requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act issued by U.S. federal banking agencies, including the OCC and the Federal Reserve, require banking organizations, including savings associations and savings and loan holding companies, with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion to conduct annual company-run stress tests, report the results to their primary federal regulator and the Federal Reserve and publish a summary of the results. Each Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test ("DFAST") must be conducted using certain scenarios (baseline, adverse and severely adverse), which the OCC and Federal Reserve will publish each year. Banking organizations are required to use the scenarios to calculate, for each quarter-end within a nine-quarter planning horizon, the impact of such scenarios on revenues, losses, loan loss reserves and regulatory capital levels and ratios, taking into account all relevant exposures and activities. The rules also require each banking organization to establish and maintain a system of controls, oversight and documentation, including policies and procedures, designed to ensure that the DFAST procedures used by the banking organization are effective in meeting the requirements of the rules.

Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the Federal Reserve’s "source of strength" doctrine and extended it to savings and loan holding companies. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the prudential regulatory agencies are required to promulgate joint rules requiring bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength for any depository institution subsidiary by maintaining the ability to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event that it suffers financial distress.
Durbin Amendment. The Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act altered the competitive structure of the debit card payment processing industry and limited debit card interchange fees for banks with over $10 billion in assets. The final rule establishes standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions. Under the final rule, the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction will be the sum of 21 cents per transaction plus 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. The impact of this amendment was a reduction in fee revenue of approximately $4 million the year ended December 31, 2017.
Collins Amendment. The Collins Amendment to Dodd-Frank established minimum Tier 1 leverage and risk-based capital requirements for insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies, and non-bank financial companies that are supervised by the Federal Reserve. The minimum Tier 1 leverage and risk-based capital requirements are determined by the minimum ratios established by the federal banking agencies that apply to insured depository institutions under the prompt corrective action regulations. The amendment states that certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, may be included in Tier 1 capital for bank holding companies that had total assets below $15 billion as of December 31, 2009. As we were below $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009, the trust preferred securities classified as long term debt on our balance sheet will be included as Tier 1 capital while they are outstanding, unless we complete an acquisition of a depository institution holding company. At our present size, with total assets of $16.9 billion at December 31, 2017, an acquisition with a depository holding company would cause our trust preferred securities totaling $247 million at December 31, 2017 to no longer be included in Tier 1 capital.
Banking Regulation
We must comply with a wide variety of banking, consumer protection and securities laws, regulations and supervisory expectations and are regulated by multiple regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
FDIC Insurance and Assessment. The FDIC insures the deposits of the Bank and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government through the DIF. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing each financial institution an insurance premium. The FDIC defined deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution is equal to the average consolidated total assets during the assessment period, minus average tangible equity. All FDIC-insured financial institutions must pay an annual assessment based on asset size to provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation ("FICO bonds"), a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the Federal Housing Finance Board. 
Affiliate Transaction Restrictions. The Bank is subject to the affiliate and insider transaction rules applicable to member banks of the Federal Reserve as well as additional limitations imposed by the OCC. These provisions prohibit or limit the Bank from extending credit to, or entering into certain transactions with principal stockholders, directors and executive officers of the banking institution and certain of its affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed further restrictions on transactions with certain affiliates and extension of credit to executive officers, directors and principal stockholders.
Limitation on Capital Distributions. The OCC regulates all capital distributions made by the Bank, directly or indirectly, to the holding company, including dividend payments. As a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, the Bank must file a notice and receive approval from the OCC at least 30 days prior to each proposed capital distribution before declaring any dividends. Additionally, the Bank may not pay dividends to the Bancorp if, after paying those dividends, the Bank would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk-based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements. Payment of dividends by the Bank also may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the OCC if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice.

Loans to One Borrower. Under the Home Owners Loan Act ("HOLA"), savings associations are generally subject to the national bank limits on loans to one borrower in excess of 15 percent of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital plus any portion of the allowance for loan losses not included in Tier 2 capital, which was $251 million as of December 31, 2017. For further information, see MD&A - Risk Management.
Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations
The Bank is subject to a number of federal consumer protection laws and regulations. These include, among others, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, electronic funds transfer laws, redlining laws, predatory lending laws, laws prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, or sale of consumer financial products or services, and the GLBA regarding customer privacy and data security. 
The Bank is subject to supervision by the CFPB, which has responsibility for enforcing federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad and unique rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to financial institutions that offer covered financial products and services to consumers, including prohibitions against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service including regulations related to the origination and servicing of residential mortgages. The CFPB has finalized significant rules and guidance that impact nearly every aspect of the life cycle of a residential mortgage and continues to revise these rules and propose new rules. The Bank is subject to the CFPB’s supervisory, examination and enforcement authority with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations. As a result, we could incur increased costs, potential litigation or be materially limited or restricted in our business, product offerings or services in the future. 
As a result of bank regulator’s focus on consumer compliance, portions of our lending operations which most directly deal with consumers, including mortgage and consumer lending, may pose particular challenges. While we are not aware of any material compliance issues related to our mortgage and consumer lending practices, the focus of regulators may increase our compliance risks. Despite the supervision and oversight we exercise in these areas, failure to comply with these regulations could result in the Bank being liable for damages to individual borrowers or other imposed penalties.
Additionally, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit financial institutions from engaging in discriminatory lending practices. The Department of Justice, CFPB, and other agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in class action litigation. A successful challenge to the Bank's performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact the Bank's rating under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in a wide variety of sanctions or penalties or limit certain revenue channels.
Incentive Compensation
The U.S. bank regulatory agencies issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of U.S. banks do not undermine safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The U.S. bank regulatory agencies review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of U.S. banks that are not "large, complex banking organizations." These reviews are tailored to each bank based on the scope and complexity of the bank’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. 
Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering
The Bank is subject to the BSA and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act. The BSA requires all financial institutions to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes various record keeping and reporting requirements such as cash transaction and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence requirements. The Bank is also required to comply with U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, individuals, entities and others.
