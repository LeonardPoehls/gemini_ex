ITEM 1. BUSINESS
1.1 BACKGROUND
   The address of our principal executive office is Kintyre House, 209 Govan Road, Glasgow G511HJ, Scotland, United Kingdom. Our telephone number is +44 141 370 0321. The Company’s web-site is http://www.hciviocare.com.
   Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets Inc. owned and operated Inter-dealer Quotation System (“OTCQB”) under the symbol "VICA".
   We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 26, 2007 as a company intending to sell medical devices in the northern regions of China. Our intent was to seek strategic relationships with medical device manufacturers both in China and North America with the aim to be their sales and distribution agent in northern China. We also intended to assist Chinese medical device manufacturers on the development of the North American market. The Company did not find suitable relationships with which to progress its business until it undertook a change in management in September 2013. With the change in management, the Company determined that it would initially concentrate on the development and marketing of medical devices in Europe, more particularly initially in Scotland, where management had identified several opportunities for entry into the markets for prosthetics and orthotics. We are currently engaged in healthcare innovation in the fields of prosthetics and orthotics (P&O), and we intend to be engaged in the operation of P&O total rehabilitation clinics. We have two wholly-owned Scottish subsidiaries: HCi Viocare Technologies Limited and HCi Viocare Clinics UK Limited.
   On December 27, 2013, pursuant to approval of the Board of Directors and the majority stock holder on November 28, 2013 and November 29, 2013 respectively, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of the Company for the purpose of clearly providing the directors of the Company with the authority to issue both common and preferred stock without approval by the stockholders and to grant the authority of the directors of the Company to issue such shares of common and/or preferred stock in one or more series, with such voting power, designation, preferences and rights or qualifications, limitations or restrictions as they may determine by resolution of the Board of Directors.
   On January 13, 2014, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. The Certificate of Designation sets forth the rights, preferences and privileges of a class of the Company’s preferred stock. Such class shall be designated as the “Series A Preferred Stock” and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 5,000,000 shares. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to a preference over all of the shares of the Company’s common stock. The holders of common stock and the holders of Series A preferred stock vote together as a single class with the holders of the Series A preferred stock having 50 votes per share of Series A preferred stock and the holders of common stock having 1 vote per share of common stock. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting. No shares of Series A preferred stock have been issued as of the filing date of this report.
   On the 15th of January, 2014, we formed our wholly-owned subsidiary, HCi Viocare Technologies Limited (“Viocare Technologies”), a corporation incorporated pursuant to the laws of Scotland, under registration number SC467480. Viocare Technologies undertakes research, development and commercialization of state of the art, new, innovative medical devices, methods and products in the fields of prosthetics, orthotics, rehabilitation, bioengineering, mobility, diabetes, diabetic foot, tissue mechanics, ultrasonics, medical signal processing and analysis, medical technology, orthopedics and robotic surgery. Viocare Technologies also plans to expand its research and development reach, to create a stable pipeline of new products and upgrades in the fields of prosthetics, orthotics, and diabetes.
   On the 12th of February, 2014 we acquired intellectual property rights ("IPR”) over an innovative medical technology entitled ‘SocketFit’ from our Board Member Dr. Christos Kapatos, as well as over any additional technologies under development or that may be developed in the future. Consideration for the acquisition of the exclusive, perpetual, revocable, transferable, royalty free worldwide ownership of the IPR, and know how to develop and exploit the IPR was the issuance of 3,500,000 shares of the common stock of the Company to Kapatos. SocketFit is a system that will help overcome technical and resource hurdles endemic to the prosthetic sector. The system has been designed with the aim of offering optimally fitted prosthetic sockets that will reduce the number of prostheses made for, resulting in a reduced number of visits by the patient to the prosthetic, and also assisting in the rehabilitation of amputees.
   On March 21, 2014, the Company’s name changed from China Northern Medical Device, Inc. to HCi Viocare in regard to actions taken on November 28, 2013, when the Board of Directors of the Company approved, and recommended to the majority stockholder that they approve the name change. On November 29, 2013, the majority stockholder approved the name change by written consent in lieu of a meeting, in accordance with Nevada State Law. FINRA approved the name change with an effective date of March 21, 2014. Our trading symbol is “VICA”. We filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada changing our name to HCi Viocare to be effective on March 21, 2014.
   On April 17, 2014, the Company, through our Scottish subsidiary, HCi Viocare Technologies Limited, entered into an acquisition agreement with Dr. Christos Kapatos, a director of both the Company and HCi Viocare Technologies (“Kapatos”), to acquire all rights and interest in and to the background IPR for a developing technology now known as “Flexisense”. Kapatos has conceived and been working on a Smart Insole System which is believed to be a state-of-the-art, pressure and shear force sensing insole with an incorporated real-time global display application and a fully featured support web-space that suggests to the user and his podiatrist/physiotherapist when inappropriate or dangerous conditions are developing on the feet. The product is being designed to help mitigate diabetic foot complications, such as ulceration, infection and amputation

A. | The Sensor Technology
---+----------------------

    As part of our ongoing development efforts stemming from R&D related to our base technologies acquired in fiscal 2014 from Dr. Christos Kapatos, notably the Smart Insole technology, HCi Viocare has developed a sensor system that can be incorporated into any thin, flexible, bendable material and is capable of measuring direct force applied vertically and shear forces applied horizontally. Each sensor can connect with other sensors, creating a network, in order to monitor an entire area.
   Due to the nature of the technology used, which is currently being kept confidential, the sensor is unaffected by bending, temperature, humidity and excess pressure, load, making it suable for medical applications, wearable devices and on-body applications. The sensor system has been designed to be used in insoles, in shoes, in cushions, seats, mattresses, saddles and any other wearable devices such as smart apparel and sports equipment. A key feature of the sensor system is its low cost, with the components for each one sensing point measuring pressure and shear forces at a cost of US$1.10, which is an order of magnitude lower than conventional pressure-only sensing solutions such as capacitance, resistance or strain gauges.
   The sensor system has been integrated into a prototype of an insole which is an autonomous, non-invasive, stand-alone unit, with its own rechargeable power supply, microcontroller and wireless communication unit. The insole can connect with smartphones, tablet pcs and pcs, through a mobile application, in order to transmit the data collected to the end user. End users could be a diabetic patient, to monitor pressure and shear forces for the prevention of diabetic foot ulcers, athletes interested in the impact on their knees of their running style or wanting to monitor the totality of their golf swing, or clinicians such as physiotherapists, orthotists and prosthetists needing to evaluate a person’s gait.
   The Company believes that there are applications for its force sensing technology in many fields within healthcare and sports, as well as more industrial fields due to its relative low cost vs conventional pressure sensing, its ability to measure shear forces in addition to pressure, its bendability and its reliability in a wide range of environments.
   During fiscal 2016 the Company branded its unique area of sensor based technologies, “FlexisenseTM”.   Please visit http://flexisense.hciviocare.com.
   Flexisense is a thin, flexible, bendable, sensor drone micro-electro-mechanical system capable of measuring direct force applied vertically on both its sides, shear force applied on its surface and 3D position and velocity of the object attached to it. The sensor is an autonomous, non-invasive, stand-alone unit, with its own rechargeable power supply, micro-controller and wireless communication unit. The drone can wirelessly connect with other drones, creating a network, in order to monitor an entire area. It can also connect with smartphones, tablet and computers, through an application which has also been developed, in order to transmit the data collected to the end user.
   Flexisense is unaffected by bending, temperature, humidity and excess pressure, load and shear, and completely insulated, making it suitable for medical applications, wearable devices and on-body applications. The drone can be made in a plethora of shapes and sizes, to fit any application/situation. The drone has been designed to be used in insoles, in shoes, in cushions, seats, mattresses, saddles and any other wearable devices such as smart apparel and sports equipment.
   Flexisense has application in every operation that a “fusion” force/pressure, shear and 3D position and velocity sensor is required. However, it was designed and developed specifically as a non-invasive medical sensor to be used in wearable devices, smart garments, training apparatus and for medical applications such as on-body, non-invasive, real time force, pressure, shear and 3D position and velocity measurements. For example, such a sensor can be invaluable for use in the monitoring of a person’s gait providing data about the pressures applied on the foot, the interaction between shoe and foot and the forces applied in the system and the angles of the joints and posture position.
   The Company concentrated its R&D efforts during early fiscal 2016 on the expansion of the commercial development of Flexisense and the second half of 2016 on seeking licensing partners for Flexisense and mattress application of the technologies, with conversations taking place with various industry partners.  During fiscal 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Carilex Medical Inc. a leading medical mattresses manufacturer.  Under the terms of the agreement the Company received a technology access fee, and will receive certain staggered success fee payments as each commercialized product under the scope of the agreement is completed.  In addition, there are product based royalty fees payable to the Company on a sliding scale based on production levels for all commercial products sold into the marketplace.
   In addition, we have entered into several cooperative agreements with industry partners across several other areas of application for our technologies and we have customized prototypes under review with various commercial partners for commercialization in fiscal 2017.
   Flexisense Application: Diabetic Insole
   The Company has developed a prototype for a smart insole measuring pressure and shear forces that can communicate wirelessly to smartphones and could be worn by diabetic patients to alert them to risky behavior and provide them and their clinicians with information to help prevent the diabetic foot ulcers that can ultimately result in amputation.
   Many complications can be associated with diabetes. Diabetes disrupts the vascular system, affecting many areas of the body such as the eyes, kidneys, legs, and feet. People with diabetes are more prone to infection. They can also develop neuropathy (damaged nerves) or peripheral vascular disease (blocked arteries) of the legs. This can cause diminished feeling in the feet leading to unnoticed cuts, scratches, and tissue breakdown. This may result in ulceration and infection. Infection and foot ulceration, alone or in combination, often lead to amputation.
     
 13
 
 
In terms of market size of the opportunity: foot complaints are the leading cause of hospitalisation of people with diabetes and is estimated that 30% of all diabetics will develop a serious foot complaint at some time (http://www.who.int/topics/diabetes_mellitus/en/). In the USA alone the value of the diabetic foot ulcers therapeutics market in 2011 was $1.53 billion, showing continuous growth.
   (http://www.companiesandmarkets.com/News/Healthcare-and-Medical/Diabetic-foot-ulcers-therapeutics-market-expected-to-maintain-a-moderate-growth/NI3941
   It is widely understood that pressure and shear forces on the feet cause ulcerations and due to diabetic patients having neuropathy (resulting in loss of sensation in the feet), feet are not offloaded or taken care of appropriately.
   It is very important for diabetics to take the necessary precautions to prevent all foot related injuries. Due to the consequences of neuropathy, daily observation of the feet is critical. Theoretically, if diabetes is well controlled and monitored it should be possible to avoid these foot problems. However, whilst clinical advice to diabetics is to ‘mind their feet’ and monitor them daily, they are not provided with a usable tool to measure the stresses and strains on their feet where there is some loss of sensation. This is what the insole intends to address.
   The resulting product(s) will be a Class 1 medical device, depending on claims and disclaimers. While default alert settings would be provided, based on existing academic and clinical research, users would be encouraged to get their physician to set parameters.
   The Company is not alone in recognizing the importance of measuring pressure on the feet of diabetics. Orpyx in Canada has launched a consumer product priced at $2,400, which requires an additional on-shoe component and a dedicated watch vs. HCi Viocare’s fully integrated insole which could be marketed at <$500. A few other start-up companies (FeetMe, Sensoria) and research groups are working on diabetic foot monitoring insoles, but all only measure pressure, ignoring shear forces which can greatly impact ulceration, and use conversional pressure sensing (capacitive or resistive technology) which the Company feels may not be as reliable in the hot and humid environment of a shoe. Because HCi Viocare’s technology measures all three forces (pressure and 2 horizontal shear forces) we are able to model with reasonable accuracy the calorific expenditure of the wearer, thereby potentially contributing to the diabetic patient’s glucose management.
   The Company is presently seeking licensing partners in respect of the diabetic insole application. The license partner could be any company marketing products to diabetics (e.g. blood glucose monitors and lancets) or wearable technologies company wanting to extend its healthcare reach (iHealth, Samsung) or foot specialist already catering to diabetic foot market (eg Dr. Scholl).

Flexisense Application: Medical gait analysis insoles
   Orthotists, podiatrists, physiotherapists and prosthetists all require a good understanding of a patient’s gait in order to diagnose biomechanical issues, provide appropriate rehabilitation and ensure appropriate alignment of the body when using orthoses (such as braces) or prosthetic limbs. Equally, researchers in these fields and biomedical engineering more generally are interested in the forces involved in gait and their impact on the body.
   Academic and commercial researchers may have force plates at their disposal: metal plates built into the floor, which can capture the forces of a person walking or running over them. However, there are prohibitively priced (>$40,000) for most clinicians. There are therefore different systems on the market addressing clinicians and researchers:
    
· | optical gait analysis: whilst these can show movement very well, they do not yield any information on forces 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | pressure mats: these measure pressure but have a small surface meaning that one can only capture a snapshot of the gait


· | pressure sensing insoles: which can measure pressure more realistically over a larger distance
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Presently we are aware of 3 devices that compete directly with the insole intended for clinical use only, each priced at in excess of $4,000: from Algeos (www.algeos.co.uk) which attaches sensors directly to the foot; and insoles from Tekscan (www.tekscan.com) , from Novel, (www.novel.de) and Moticon (www.moticon.de).
   Management believes its medical insole would be unique in its ability to measure shear forces, and to operate for longer periods of time reliability and accurately due to limitations of the competing technologies (eg in humidity, when bent). Moreover, unlike the HCi Viocare prototype, existing insoles are not stand-alone, requiring ancillary componentry to communicate with the data capture unit and therefore making their use restricted to in-clinic. A cheaper, stand-alone insole could be given to patients to take away and record gait over time and over different surfaces.
   The medical insole can also be expanded to become a combined 3D motion capture and gait analysis system for use by physiotherapists, orthotists, athletes and possibly in film and gaming.
   Flexisense Application: Athletic insoles
   Sports and fitness wearable devices have been in the market for more than 30 years. However, in the last 3 years the application of micro-electronics, wireless technology and the explosion of smartphones and mobile applications has revolutionised the market, with many established, as well as new, companies offering products applications for a wide range of sports.
   Wearable wireless devices in the Sports, Fitness and Wellness market measure sports performance, daily activity, sleep patterns, and other related physical parameters. Another key factor that distinguishes this market is its consumer focus and that, unlike devices in the other healthcare markets, these devices usually do not require regulatory approval as a medical device.
   The consumer market for wearable devices is exploding, and people appear to have an insatiable appetite for data to analyse their fitness and athletic performance. Nearly 50 million sports performance monitors were sold in 2014 and Worldwide revenue is forecast to reach $2.3 billion in 2017.  http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/396065/file-2568104498-pdf/Blog_Resources/IHS-Wearable-Technology.pdf?t=1427903372862
   Companies like Adidas-Salomon Ag, Nike Inc., Garmin, New Balance and Suunto invest millions of dollars every year for the development of wearable devices and material, and the market is booming as demand is ever increasing. The focus for most of these companies seems to be in the running shoes, apparel and equipment sector, as this sector is the fastest growing sports and fitness sector world-wide with billions of dollars of revenue every year. Under Armour has just launched its first smart shoe, monitoring only cadence.
     
 15
 
 
The Company’s sensor technology can be used in an insole or built into shoes to provide information to the wearer. It is the only pressure sensing technology that can work accurately in a warm and moist environment and with significant bending, like that experienced during running.
   In keeping with the attractiveness of the market, there are a number of relatively new companies intending to launch insoles to give information to runners, together with coaching ‘Apps’. Some of these measure only contact or movement (e.g., www.ambiorun.com) and others do measure pressure, usually not fully wireless/stand-alone (Medhab www.medhab.com; Arion www.ato-gear.com). Another competitor is Sensoria which markets a smart textile sock that measures pressure and pace. It also has a ‘running coach’ App. It requires an anklet to be worn, to house the battery and communication modules, and the socks require washing, potentially reducing their life span.
   Note that the resistive or capacitive technologies used by competition struggle with bending and hot/humid environments and are therefore considered to be less reliable. Also, due to the cost associated with pressure sensing, competitors usually only have a small number of sensing points, limiting the value of the information. The Company’s more cost effective sensing technology would permit a much greater number of points.
   A further important differentiator from the competition is that the Company’s sensor technology measures forces in three directions, giving not just plantar pressure information but also making the system capable of using industry accepted biomechanical modelling capabilities to project the impact on the knee of the wearer’s running style. And the knee is an area of great focus for runners, who frequently experience injuries.
   The athletic insoles could be coupled with other devices to give wearable performance information across a number of sports, including the high value tennis and golf markets. Golfers, for example would be able to link their swing (from an on-club sensor) to their weight displacement to optimise their performance. Currently on-racket or on-club sensors exist but fail to address this critical weight placement / foot force element for the athletes.
   The Company is presently seeking licensing partners in respect of the athletic insole applications, with a number of discussions with market leaders in their fields ongoing and additional commercial prototypes under review.
  Smart Mattress
   Ulceration and skin (soft tissue) breakage is very common to people with tetraplegia or paraplegia and to most patients with limited movability that spend time in a bed, or in a wheelchair. It is caused by low continued pressure over time and/or high (peak) pressure points. The most commonly used method in a clinical environment, to avoid ulceration in such patients, is for a nurse to “turn” them, in better words; to change the position in which they lay in bed, frequently. This practice is supported by specialist therapeutic support surfaces (mattresses and overlays) to attempt to reduce pressure points. The more modern surfaces are powered air mattresses. There are different types of powered air mattresses, which can alternate pressure in their air cells on a pre-defined timetable.
   In terms of market opportunity, hospitals are under tremendous pressure to address decubitus, particularly in the US where payers are moving away from covering “never events”. Pressure ulcers affect a million patients in the USA alone each year and it costs the US healthcare system alone an est. $12 billion in direct treatment costs, not counting associated costs such as medical malpractice lawsuits;
     
 16
 
 
Existing market solutions:
    
• | Adoption of pressure relieving overlays is increasing; these are generally not ‘active’ and merely made of a suitable material to reduce pressure, resulting in a lower cost; Whilst there is no direct clinical evidence for their effectiveness, there is a widespread belief and acceptance that they can reduce pressure ulcers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Winncare's Axensor system is an example of an inflatable mattress with sections which goes through a standard cycle of in-/deflation to relieve pressure; these are increasingly common for high risk patients and are supplied by all leading therapeutic support surface manufacturers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Israeli start-up Wellsense has the first pressure sensing mattress cover and their clinical evidence shows that the monitoring of pressure alone is already effective; however, it has low adoption because it is not breathable (which could aggravate ulcer formation) and it is costs >$3,000.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With the Company’s sensor technology incorporated into mattresses and overlays, for which a prototype exists, technology licensees could develop a range of products with the following: lower production costs, sensors not affecting the properties of the mattresses, ability to measure shear in addition to pressure (shear forces being a recognized key contributor to ulceration).
   Furthermore, with the sensor integrated into an inflatable mattress itself, we have developed a smart mattress that can respond intelligently to the pressure and shear data and inflate and deflate the mattress compartments automatically to reduce the risk of ulceration for patients, in between nursing interventions.  This dynamic smart mattress adapts to the specific need of every patient and provides relief and adjustment only where and when is needed, maximising the effectiveness of the treatment. This would be classed as a Class 1 medical device, and the license partner would need to pursue such registration prior to launch.
   As noted above the Company has entered into an agreement with Carilex Medical Inc. a leading medical mattresses manufacturer where under the Company receives technology access fees and additional fees for each commercialized product under the scope of the agreement when completed. Further there are product based royalty fees payable to the Company on a sliding scale based on production levels for all commercial products sold into the marketplace.
   Wheelchairs and medical chairs
   The same technology as the Mattress can be used to provide pressure and shear monitoring integrated into wheelchair cushions and medical day-chairs to help prevent ulceration. This may be licensed to the same license partner as the mattress solutions.
   Automotive
   By incorporating the HCi Viocare sensor technology into automotive seating, professional drivers could be monitored automatically for posture, projected blood circulation, pressure and shear. Posture is important as back pain is a leading cause of absenteeism in the workplace, but in a driving environment, positioning can be an indicator of fatigue, a leading cause of accidents. Adoption of such technology could be driven by health and safety considerations and/or the insurance industry.
   The Company is seeking partners in the automotive industry to discuss the potential of incorporating the technology into their vehicles.
 
 
B. | SocketFit
---+----------

    The Company will build on the work done by Dr. Kapatos in developing a scanning device to determine the optimal shape of an amputee’s socket, capturing the internal geometry and the biomechanical properties of the tissues in the residual limb. This SocketFit technology was acquired in 2014. The intention is to partner with a leading scanning provider or manufacturer in the P&O market, through a development and license agreement, to produce a socket system for use by prosthetists worldwide.
     
 17
 
 
Market opportunity
   The number of amputees world-wide is estimated to be 20 million, and for most amputees finding a well-fitted prosthesis is far from easy. Traditional methods of design, manufacture and fitting of a prosthetic socket are typically carried out by “artisan” techniques but unfortunately often result in ill-fitting devices that make wearing a prosthesis almost intolerable for a large number of amputees.
   A prosthetic socket is a custom-made “cone” that connects the rest of the prosthesis (foot, shank and knee) to an amputee’s residual limb. Sockets generally need to be replaced every other year, though more frequently in the initial stages after amputation when the residual limb can still change shape significantly. While many significant technological advances have been made with the design and manufacture of prosthetic components, such as electronic knee assemblies and feet, socket design has not kept up. Over the past 20 years a great deal of research has been undertaken to automate the process of socket design and manufacturing, but it has been met with limited success. Most sockets continue to be created with hand-sculpted plaster moulds made by the Prosthetist or a technician hours or days after examining the amputee. The result is that, typically, one in four sockets are discarded because of their poor fit.
   Many prosthetists, (if not all), are frustrated by the lack of an objective method that would ensure an optimum fit of the socket. This ‘need’ for assistance instigated the advent of industrial sector technologies to be taken up in the field, even though these systems, in reality, lack the necessary ‘ingredient’ to allow the optimum socket to be produced. They merely attempt to replicate current practices in a digital manner (CAD-CAM systems), without taking into account the biomechanical or anatomical characteristics of the residual limb.
   The key element of the project is work done by Dr. Christos Kapatos to improve the nature of the data used in socket modeling software. Finite element analysis (FEA) has been used widely in a variety of applications, including prosthetics. But its prosthetics applications have suffered from the fact that only external boundary data and limited information on the nature of the internal tissue was provided. The results were not promising. By including far more data on the nature of the internal anatomy as well as, for the first time ever (to our knowledge) data on the bio-mechanical properties of the tissue to the FEA, a system can be created that enables Prosthetists to build a socket that evenly distributes weight, provides enhanced comfort, and raises the bar across the industry on socket creation.
   SocketFit is a digital system for assessing an amputee’s residual limb and for the production of truly functional and comfortable prosthetic sockets. It takes account of the external and internal geometry of the amputee’s stump, the biomechanical properties of each individual soft tissue layer i.e. skin, fat, muscle and bone, and the boundary and loading conditions of a complete prosthesis to generate a virtual 3D model of the residual limb. It is then possible to produce an accurate, functional and comfortable prosthetic socket.
   By minimising the time and cost of socket production and by reducing the number of faulty sockets (it has been reported that a quarter of all prostheses are currently rejected due to poor fit), there will be a reduction in costs incurred by health services and insurance companies worldwide as well as great benefits to the amputee.
   The technology
   The intended Socket-Fit device consists of three modules:
    
1. | The Ring - a device to scan the residual limb and export data, which uses ultrasound technology. The external geometry of the medium under examination, is acquired by the position data from the stepper instruments and the use of the rotary position sensors; as the ring moves vertically, spinning at the same time, the spring-supported arms comes in contact with the entire residual limb, mapping every detail and transmitting it to a PC. The internal geometry is acquired with the use of the on-board ultrasound transducers. Information on the mechanical properties of the tissues has also been captured. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Data Tools – software to analyse and collate the data into intelligible information. All the data are sent to the control box for onward transmission to the PC. Software generates a 3D image of the stump’s external and internal geometry. 


3. | Socket Modelling – FEA simulation FEA and optimisation software generate the optimum design for the socket in order to obtain the best pressure distribution, and therefore the most comfortable prosthesis for the amputee. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

    
 18
 
 

The process to getting to an optimized socket shape is shown in figure 2 and a schematic of the system in figure 3.
 

  Figure 2: Process map of system
 
     Figure 3: Schematic of the system
 
      
 19
 
 

The greatest value provided by the acquired SocketFit technology rests in the algorithms that transform the data captured by the ultrasound transducers on the Ring to sanitized, usable data about the biomechanical properties of the tissues scanned. Specifically, the algorithms use data derived from the scans to generate stress-strain curves for the tissue layers within the limb.
   This data is then used by the FEA software to simulate pressures onto the residual limb, similar to those experienced when walking, for different shapes of sockets, until the ultimate shape is found – meaning, the shape that provides uniform pressure where needed and avoids known pain areas (eg bone) to create a socket designed to have superior comfort in use.
   Current Status of SocketFit
   We plan to first find a commercialization partner, to help fund and/or conduct the required research and development and to launch the product within two years of commencement of the proposed research and development. This is to minimise risk but also because the technology could be designed to (retro-)fit into the partners’ existing product suite, minimizing effort. While the Company focuses attention on its immediately marketable Sensor Technology and its varying applications, any additional development work for SocketFit is currently on hold.
    
C. | Other technology opportunities
---+-------------------------------

    Blood flow visualization:
   The Company has developed a proof of concept device that permits the visualization of peripheral blood flow. This could be incorporated into a smart ‘mat’ for the diagnosis and progression monitoring of diabetic foot conditions. Diabetic patients can suffer from reduced peripheral blood flow in their feet. This contributes to neuropathy but also prevents the healing of diabetic foot ulcers, which can lead to amputation. Such a mat could shift the monitoring of diabetic foot care to primary care, away from podiatry specialists, but also provide essential health information to podiatrists which they would otherwise not have. With a relatively low manufacturing cost, patients could even monitor their own condition at home. It is hoped the product would be prescribed/reimbursed.
   Sleep apnea device (BiPAP)
    
• | The company has developed an early prototype of a small, silent, portable bidirectional airway device to assist sufferers of sleep apnea

    Robotic surgical assist
    
• | Working (miniature) prototype of robotic device to assist in orthopaedic surgery, reducing number of staff in OR; uses proprietary sensor technology also used in Digital Health products
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Adaptive socket
    
• | The ‘Holy Grail’ of prosthetic sockets, this technology would utilise our proprietary pressure and shear sensors to signal a smart material inside the socket to adapt its shape to the wearer’s gait and daily fluctuations in the size and shape of the stump.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Photo acoustic imaging
    
• | The team is exploring a theory that would remove the barriers currently preventing the human adoption of photo acoustic imaging, producing a relatively low-cost non-contact, non-invasive methodology. This would be a substantial project but with the potential to transform medical imaging.

D. | Intellectual property
---+----------------------

    We have acquired exclusive ownership of the innovative medical device ‘SocketFit’. Dr. Kapatos in conjunction with another development company had prior filed a patent application which has been abandoned. Significant development of the technology has been undertaken since the filing of the abandoned patent and, after corresponding with our patent agents, it was deemed in the best interests of the Company not to revive the old patent, but to apply for new – multiple patents on the technology, and use the old patent as background technology, as new innovations have sprang out of the initial patent and additional fields of application have been identified.
   We have acquired all rights and interest in and to the background IPR for a developing technology now known as “Flexisense”. Dr. Kapatos has conceived and been working on various applications of Flexisense including a Smart Insole System which is believed to be a state-of-the-art, pressure and shear pressure sensing insole with an incorporated real-time global display application and a fully featured support web-space that tells the user and his podiatrist/physiotherapist when inappropriate or dangerous conditions are developing on the feet. The product is being designed to mitigate diabetic foot complications, such as ulceration, infection and amputation, as well as improve the total health of a person with diabetes, by incorporating the readings from the insole system to a specialized web-space that will help the user monitor not just the health of his feet but also his diabetes by looking after his diet and exercise. The Company has also identified various other applications.  Presently we have filed three patents in the UK in respect of this IPR:
   British Patent Application No. 1421952.1, HCI VIOCARE TECHNOLOGIES LTD. (abandoned December 2015)
   - The first patent based on development of the “Insole” IP relates to the Company’s pressure sensing system technology, which supports the development of very low cost, flexible and scalable pressure sensing devices in a range of sectors including wearable devices, Prosthetics & Orthotics, medical devices (e.g. for the diabetic foot), and automotive health and safety.
   British Patent Application No. 1421950.5, HCI VIOCARE TECHNOLOGIES LTD. (abandoned December 2015)
   - The second patent, also based on additional development of the “Insole” IP relates to the Company’s ground-breaking shear sensing system technology, which is supports the development of low cost, flexible and scalable sensor systems in a range of sectors including wearable devices, medical devices (e.g. diabetic foot), Prosthetics & Orthotics and automotive health and safety
   British Patent Application No. 1421953.9, HCI VIOCARE TECHNOLOGIES LTD. (abandoned December 2015)
   - The third patent application also follows additional in-house development of the “Insole” intellectual property (IP) and relates to pioneering low-cost, portable motion capture and gait analysis technology, which has applications in a range of sectors, including athletic wearable devices, physiotherapy, orthotics and potentially also gaming and film.
   International Patent Application No. PCT/GB2015/053785, HCI VIOCARE TECHNOLOGIES LTD.
   On December 10, 2015 the Company through its subsidiary HCi Viocare Technologies Ltd. filed an international application according to the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) which received a PCT application number PCT/GB2015/053785.  The filed international patent covers over 140 countries around the world. The new patent builds on the company’s three UK patent applications filed in December 2014 (as set out above), with further advances made to the sensor systems, and a wider range of applications in products that touch people’s everyday lives.
   The Company has drafted and performed preliminary patent searches on two new innovations during fiscal 2016, with intent to progress into full patent applications in 2017.

E. | Regulatory Requirements
---+------------------------

    The Company’s business model of licensing technology to commercialization partners means that it is the partner, who will be the manufacturer of the eventual products and therefore subjected to the regulations of manufacturing and marketing devices. However, as the Company will support its licensing partner in the development of the final products it has ensured that in understands the eventual requirements, and has identified suitable consultants to provide support, where required.
   The products are expected to be marketed worldwide, with an initial commercialization in Europe and the USA, depending on the partner. Their regulatory systems are highlighted below, together with the anticipated implications for the products that may result from our technologies.
   Europe
   Products that will be marketed in Europe will be required to comply with the EU Directives regarding medical devices, which apply to all EU member states. The basic relevant EU Directive which applies to our case is Directive 93/42/EEC (as amended by 2007/47/EC) regulating medical devices, as well as Directive 98/68/EEC that requires the manufacturers to place CE marking on their products to demonstrate compliance with the above regulations.
   The Directive on medical devices also lays down rules in Annex IX for the classification of devices based essentially on the potential risks involved, with class III devices having the highest potential risk and class I device the lowest.
   With reference to the stated Rules to determine a product’s classification, the anticipated classification of the products that could arise from the Company’s technology are listed below. It is important to note that classification is determined only at the stage of a final product and with reference to its features and the claims made by the manufacturer. Hence, there classifications are dependent on the decisions of the license partner and may be subject to change:

· | Diabetic and Medical Insoles: Class I 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | SocketFit: Class IIa – because of the use of ultrasound, which applies energy to the body. This is the usual classification for imaging devices.


· | Photoacoustic imaging: Class IIa – because energy is applied to the body 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Blood Flow visualization: Class IIs – because energy is applied to the body


· | BiPAP: Class IIb – as it is relied upon for breathing
--+------------------------------------------------------

    The Notified Body of the country in which the products are marketed will need to notified by the manufacturer, and their specific processes for registration and audit will need to be adhered to.
   USA Regulations
   Medical devices are subject to the general controls of the Federal Food Drug & Cosmetic (FD&C) Act which are contained in the final procedural regulations in Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 800-1200 (21 CFR Parts 800 - 1299). These controls are the baseline requirements that apply to all medical devices necessary for marketing, proper labeling and monitoring its performance once the device is on the market.
   Much like in Europe, the license partner will be required to determine how FDA may classify our devices - which one of the three classes the device may fall into. Unless exempt, FDA will classify our devices. Classification identifies the level of regulatory control that is necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of a medical device. Most importantly, the classification of the device will identify, unless exempt, the marketing process (either premarket notification [510(k)] or premarket approval (PMA)) the manufacturer must complete in order to obtain FDA clearance/approval for marketing.
   The Company will need to review the development of data and/or information necessary to submit a marketing application, and to obtain FDA clearance to market. For some [510(k)] submissions and most PMA applications, clinical performance data is required to obtain clearance to market. In these cases, conduct of the trial must be done in accord with FDA's Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulation, in addition to marketing clearance.

1.3 OUR CLINICS
    
A. | Market and Industry
---+--------------------

    It is estimated that the global health market is growing by 6-8% per annum, which suggests it will double in the next 10 years. The global Orthopedic Prosthetics market seems to be following the same pattern, as it is growing rapidly, and is projected to exceed US$ 4.5 billion by 2017, according to the 2011 Global Data’s report “Orthotics and Prosthetics - Global Pipeline Analysis, Competitive Landscape and Market Forecasts to 2017”.
   Demand for orthopedic prosthetics products is driven by a multitude of factors, including:
    
· | growing elderly population: The percentage of people aged 65 and older will increase at a rate three times that of younger generations. Subsequently, the frequency of vascular diseases and diabetes – diseases that often lead to amputation – will increase considerably; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | causes of amputation: the most common causes of amputation are prosperity diseases related to diseases, such as diabetes and vascular diseases. Accidents account for only 26% of all amputations in developed countries. Indicatively, it is estimated that the number of people with diabetes worldwide (382 million as of November 2013) is expected to reach 592 million by 2035. As a result of the general increase in diabetes and vascular diseases, the number of amputations in the western world is also likely to continue to increase;


· | rising incidence of degenerative joint diseases, such as osteoporosis and arthritis, and increasing numbers of sports injuries; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | social demands: the growing desire of more and more disabled individuals – especially young people – to become independent, lead active lifestyles, and go about their daily routines without outside help;


· | renewal: the lifetime of traditional prosthetic devices used by previous generations is three to five years. Also prosthetic sockets require replacement after three to six months; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | market niche: reorganization of healthcare services has led to increased pressure to lower costs within the health sector, which in turn increases the demand for the efficiency of the solutions chosen; and


· | the growing demand for orthopedic prosthetics products is also driving the development of innovative medical devices forward. Advancements in biological science and stem cells technology, as well as rapid technological advances in medical science and development of durable and improved materials and implants have led to large number of people requiring physical rehabilitation, thus contributing to the market’s growth.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Overall, the market is set to grow significantly as the incidence of amputation increases. The number of amputees living in developing countries is estimated by the World Health Organization to have reached 300 million with up to 95% lacking access to prosthetic devices, thereby creating an increasing consumer base in need for affordable and reliable orthopedic prosthetics products and services that will improve the amputees’ long-term health and well-being.
   Current solutions are inadequate, however, as state-of-the-art solutions from the US and Europe are cost-prohibitive, while low-cost devices run the risk of poor quality and/or unreliable performance. Especially in low-income areas and in developing countries, where the P&O industry is highly fragmented and poorly organized, with significant disparities in terms of clinical infrastructure, provision of medical rehabilitation and assistive devices, demographics (such as gender and/or socioeconomic inequalities), and funding.

B. | Clinics:
---+---------

    On January 15, 2014, we formed our other wholly-owned Scottish subsidiary, HCi Viocare Clinics UK Limited with registration number SC467486 (“Viocare Clinics”), with the intent to create the first state-of-the-art chain of Prosthetic and Orthotic (P&O) and diabetic foot clinics with global reach, while capitalizing on the aforementioned internally developed technologies. Viocare Clinics will establish and/or acquire movement rehabilitation clinics, limb fitting centers and diabetic foot centers, in the UK, Europe and the Middle East, initially. These centers will offer standardized and specialized rehabilitation and consultation services for the physically impaired, as well as for their families, friends, their workplaces and companies that employ or work with them. Some of the sections that will be covered by the centers are:
    
· | Prosthetic rehabilitation;
--+---------------------------
· | Orthotic rehabilitation; 


· | Diabetic foot; 
--+------------------------------------------------------
· | Foot congenital disorder and musculoskeletal defects;


· | Movement assisting devices;
--+----------------------------
· | Gait analysis; 


· | Pediatric movement analysis and consultation; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Living and working spaces design and consultation for people with disabilities;


· | Walking training and body strengthening following amputation, stroke or accident;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Phantomlimb syndrome consultation; 


· | Workshops and educational and training programs; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Expert opinion mediation with insurance companies and organizations.

      
  
 24
 
 
  
The primary customers will be the physically impaired:
    
· | Amputees; 
--+------------------------
· | People with spasticity;


· | People with walking difficulties; 
--+-----------------------------------
· | People with genetic abnormalities;


· | People with deformities; 
--+----------------------------------
· | People with musculoskeletal pain;


· | People with diabetes; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | People with flat foot problems or just pain caused by long working hours or hard labor; and


· | Companies or organizations that employ or work with people with disabilities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  However, the market is not limited to these people; our customers will be families with children with disabilities and businesses that employ disabled persons.
   Viocare Clinics operates in accordance with the standard mandated by the British Association of Prosthetist Orthotists and the International Society of Prosthetics and Orthotics.
   In the next 3-4 years we target to establish a chain of 5 prosthetic, orthotic and diabetic foot rehabilitation centres in Europe and 2 centres in the Middle East through JVs, under the Viocare brand.
    
• | Glasgow: Existing Prosthetic practice acquired and being expanded to include Orthotics; serves as the centre of reference and training ground for our other clinics. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Mediterranean: The Mediterranean is prime location for medical and wellbeing tourism. It has also been used in governmental aid, e.g. Libya’s amputees, which we would seek to re-start. Targeted locations: Athens, Spain, Portugal.

Glasgow Clinic
    
· | The private practice of William Spence, WD Spence Prosthetics Ltd was acquired in June 2014, a profitable venture that was established in 2006, operating part-time with borrowed premises;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | New premises of 5300 ft2 were secured in Spring 2015, to increase the capacity of the clinic, provide an on-site workshop to improve turnaround times and also to house our R&D staff, thereby facilitating the exchange of ideas;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The clinic was refurbished and reopened in September 2015 and is currently being actively marketed, with patient lead coming via:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Personal injury solicitors (road traffic and workplace accidents)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Word of mouth or internet searches
--+-----------------------------------


- | Social media marketing
--+-----------------------


- | Print advertisement
--+--------------------


· | Due to the high quality care of the National Health Service, the market for private P&O provision is small, however, the clinic is the only private P&O clinic in the whole of Scotland;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | It attracts patients from England also, where the market leader is Dorset Orthopedics (owned by Otto Bock) with a number of full-service and satellite clinics. However, provision in the North continues to be very limited.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Glasgow clinic has recently completed its first full year of operations since relocation to a larger state of the art faculty.  As a result the Clinic has experienced substantive year over year revenue growth as we begin to establish a presence in the UK market.  The Company anticipated continued growth in the future as the clinic’s level of service and facility benefits become more well known in the UK market.
 
Competition
   Hanger (www.hanger.com) dominates the prosthetic and orthotic clinic market in the USA, with over 1300 clinicians across over 740 clinics. However, in the rest of the world, provision of P&O services is extremely fragmented. Otto Bock, the market leading manufacturer of prosthetic components and vertically integrated to also provide clinical services at their headquarters and through clinics that have been acquired over time, focusing on Northern, Western Europe.  Ossur, the Icelandic company which has roughly 20% of the P&O componentry market, has also expanded into clinic in Northern Europe.
   The Company’s focus is on areas that are under-served both in terms of capacity and in the quality of service. Competition varies location by location ranging from the very fragmented to the very concentrated.
   The Viocare clinics will seek to differentiate through high quality care, staff trained to British and International standards, modern systems and processes and a wide range of products from low- to high end. They will also provide a more holistic suite of services, to include physiotherapy, mental health and lifestyle rehabilitation. Also, our scientific team will lead the technological diversification of the clinics, thereby setting them apart from the competition. We will capitalize on our Scientific Board’s vast network of connections to attract customers from neighboring nations and will seek cooperation with global Medical Tourism operators.
