We plan to generate revenues through the sale of our premium package services, which allows members of other popular social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, to join our website with their current username without the need to register as new members on our website, at a cost of $12.50 to $125.00 per year and (ii) advertising space on our website.
 
We plan to focus our efforts on driving visitors to our website by promoting our website with Google Adwords and making our website more accessible to visitors from other social networks such as Facebook and Twitter and by adding language translations to foreign visitors. We will also attempt to generate revenues by negotiating agreements with third-party merchants to display their goods on our site and pay us a commission if our visitors purchase their products. We have identified some merchants who currently offer their products through our online store, but plan to identify and enter into selling arrangements more merchants, though there can be no assurance that we will be able to once we reach this stage in our business development.
 
Provided we raise sufficient proceeds from the offering, although there can be no assurance at the present time, we expect to start generating revenues within 4 to 6 months following launch.
 
We are in the early stage of our business plan. We currently have little revenues and few premium members of our website. Our activities to date have been limited to organizational matters, development of our business plan, development of our website, and efforts related to becoming a publicly traded company.
 
Our offices are currently located at 11801 Pierce St., 2nd Floor, Riverside, California 92505.
