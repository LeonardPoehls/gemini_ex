Item 1.    Business. 
Our Company 
We are the preeminent and most integrated provider of residential real estate services in the U.S. We are the world's largest franchisor of residential real estate brokerages with some of the most recognized brands in the real estate industry, the largest owner of U.S. residential real estate brokerage offices, one of the largest U.S. and a leading global provider of outsourced employee relocation services and a significant provider of title and settlement services. 
Our revenue is derived on a fee-for-service basis, and given our breadth of complementary service offerings, we are able to generate fees from multiple aspects of a residential real estate transaction. Our operating platform is supported by our portfolio of industry leading franchise brokerage brands, including Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, ERA®, Sotheby's International Realty® and Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate. We also own and operate Corcoran®, Citi HabitatsSM and ZipRealty® brands. Our multiple brands and operations allow us to derive revenue from many different segments of the residential real estate market, in many different geographies and at varying price points.
Segment Overview 
We report our operations in four segments, each of which receives fees based upon services performed for our customers: Real Estate Franchise Services ("RFG"), Company Owned Real Estate Brokerage Services ("NRT"), Relocation Services ("Cartus®") and Title and Settlement Services ("TRG"). See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the financial statements, including the notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further information on our reportable segments.
Real Estate Franchise Services. We are the largest franchisor of residential real estate brokerages in the world through our portfolio of well-known brokerage brands, including Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, ERA®, Sotheby's International Realty® and Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate. At December 31, 2016, our real estate franchise systems (inclusive of our company owned brokerage operations) had approximately 14,100 offices worldwide in 112 countries and territories. This included approximately 6,000 brokerage offices in the U.S. and approximately 273,200 independent sales associates worldwide, including approximately 186,300 independent sales associates operating under our franchise and proprietary brands in the U.S. The average tenure among U.S. franchisees is approximately 21 years as of December 31, 2016. Our franchisees pay us fees for the right to operate under one of our trademarks and to enjoy the benefits of the systems and business enhancing tools provided by our real estate franchise operations. In addition to highly competitive brands that provide unique offerings to our franchisees, we support our franchisees with dedicated national marketing and servicing programs, technology including the Zap® technology platform described below, training and education to facilitate our franchisees in growing their business and increasing their revenue and profitability. We believe 
4

that one of our strengths is the strong relationships that we have with our franchisees, as evidenced by our 98% retention rate as of December 31, 2016. Our retention rate represents the annual franchisee gross commission income for the year ended December 31, 2015 generated by our franchisees that remain in our franchise systems as of December 31, 2016, measured against the annual gross commission income of all franchisees for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, ZapLabs LLC (which changed its name from ZipRealty LLC in 2016) is the developer of our proprietary technology platform for the real estate brokerages and independent sales associates in our franchise system as well as their customers. During 2016, we rolled out ZapLabs' comprehensive, integrated Zap technology platform to approximately 1,110 franchisees, bringing the total enrolled to 1,500 at December 31, 2016 of our approximately 2,600 franchisees. Consistent with our previously disclosed plan, we anticipate rolling this product out to a majority of our remaining franchisees within the next twelve months. We believe the Zap technology platform will increase the value proposition to franchisees, independent sales associates and customers as well as improve the productivity of independent sales associates.
Company Owned Real Estate Brokerage Services. We own and operate the largest residential real estate brokerage business in the U.S. under the Coldwell Banker®, Corcoran®, Sotheby's International Realty®, ZipRealty® and Citi HabitatsSM brand names. We offer full-service residential brokerage services through approximately 790 company owned brokerage offices with approximately 47,500 independent sales associates in more than 50 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas of the U.S. NRT, as the broker for a home buyer or seller, derives revenues primarily from gross commission income received at the closing of real estate transactions. NRT also has relationships with developers, primarily in major cities, to provide marketing and brokerage services in new developments. To complement its residential brokerage services, NRT offers home ownership services that include comprehensive single-family residential property management in many of the nation's largest rental markets. In addition, we participate in the mortgage process through our 49.9% ownership of PHH Home Loans LLC ("PHH Home Loans"), our home mortgage venture with PHH. See Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" under the heading "Recent Developments" for information regarding the formation of our new mortgage origination joint venture.
Relocation Services. We are a leading global provider of outsourced employee relocation services. We are one of the largest providers of such services in the U.S. and also operate in key international relocation destinations. We offer a broad range of world-class employee relocation services designed to manage all aspects of an employee's move to facilitate a smooth transition in what otherwise may be a complex and difficult process for the employee and employer. Our relocation services business serves corporations, including 56% of the Fortune 50 companies. We also service affinity organizations such as insurance companies and credit unions that provide our services to their members. In 2016, we assisted in approximately 163,000 corporate and affinity relocations in nearly 150 countries for approximately 800 active clients. As of December 31, 2016, our top 25 relocation clients had an average tenure of approximately 20 years with us. Member brokers of the Cartus Broker Network, including certain franchisees and NRT, receive referrals from the relocation services, affinity services and from each other in exchange for a referral fee. 
Title and Settlement Services. We assist with the closing of real estate transactions by providing full-service title and settlement (i.e., closing and escrow) services to customers, real estate companies, including our company owned real estate brokerage and relocation services businesses, as well as a targeted channel of large financial institution clients. In 2016, TRG was involved in the closing of approximately 204,000 transactions of which approximately 60,000 related to NRT. In addition to our own title and settlement services, we also coordinate a nationwide network of attorneys, title agents and notaries to service financial institution and relocation clients on a national basis. We also serve as an underwriter of title insurance policies in connection with residential and commercial real estate transactions.

Industry Trends 
Industry definition.  We primarily operate in the U.S. residential real estate industry, which is approximately a $1.7 trillion industry based on 2016 transaction volume (i.e. average homesale price times number of new and existing homesale transactions) and derive substantially all of our revenues from serving the needs of buyers and sellers of existing homes rather than those of new homes. Residential real estate brokerage companies typically realize revenues in the form of a commission that is based on a percentage of the price of each home sold. As a result, the real estate industry generally benefits from rising home prices and increasing homesale transactions (and conversely is adversely impacted by falling prices and lower homesale transactions). We believe that existing homesale transactions and the services associated with these transactions, such as mortgage origination, title services and relocation services, represent one of the most attractive segment of the residential real estate industry for the following reasons:

• | the existing homesales segment represents a significantly larger addressable market than new homesales. Of the approximately 6.0 million homesales in the U.S. in 2016, NAR estimates that approximately 5.5 million were existing homesales, representing approximately 91% of the overall sales as measured in units; 


• | existing homesales afford us the opportunity to represent either the buyer or the seller and in some cases both the buyer and the seller; and


• | we are able to generate revenues from ancillary services provided to our customers.

We also believe that the traditional broker-assisted business model compares favorably to alternative channels of the residential brokerage industry, such as discount brokers and "for sale by owner" for the following reasons:

• | a real estate transaction has certain characteristics that we believe are best suited for full-service brokerages, such as:


◦ | the average homesale transaction size is very high and generally is the largest transaction one does in a lifetime;


◦ | homesale transactions occur infrequently;


◦ | there is a compelling need for personal service as home preferences are unique to each buyer;


◦ | a high level of support is required given the complexity associated with the process;


◦ | there is a high variance in price, depending on neighborhood, floor plan, architecture, fixtures, and outdoor space; and


◦ | there is a need for specific marketing and technology services and support given the complexity of the transaction.


• | while substantially all homebuyers start their search for a home using the internet, according to NAR, 88% of homes were sold using an agent or broker in 2016 compared to 79% in 2001. We believe that the enhanced service and value offered by a traditional agent or broker is such that using a traditional agent or broker will continue to be the primary method of buying and selling a home in the long term. 

Cyclical nature of industry.  The U.S. residential real estate industry is cyclical, but has historically shown strong growth over time. Based on information published by NAR, existing homesale units increased at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 2.0% from 1972 through 2016, with 28 annual increases, versus 16 annual decreases. During that same period, median existing homesale prices increased at a CAGR of 4.9% (not adjusted for inflation) from 1972 through 2016, a period that included four economic recessions. According to NAR, the existing homesale transaction volume (median homesale price times existing homesale transactions) grew at a CAGR of 7.0% from 1972 through 2016. 
Commencing in the second half of 2005 and continuing through 2011, the U.S. residential real estate industry was in a significant and lengthy downturn. Based upon data published by NAR from 2005 to 2011, the number of annual U.S. existing homesale transactions declined by 40% and the median existing homesale price declined by 24%. 
Beginning in 2012, the U.S. residential real estate industry began its recovery with the first two years—2012 and 2013—showing double digit volume growth with single digit annual growth thereafter. Based upon data published by NAR from 
6

2011 to 2016, the number of annual U.S. existing homesale units and the median existing homesale price improved by 28% and 41%, respectively. 
Long-term demographics.  We believe that long-term demand for housing and the growth of our industry is primarily driven by affordability, the economic health of the U.S. economy, demographic trends such as population growth, increases in the number of U.S. households, low interest rates, increases in renters that qualify as homebuyers and locally based factors. We believe that the residential real estate market will benefit over the long term from expected positive fundamentals, including the following factors: 

• | based on U.S. Census data and NAR, from 1991 through 2016, the average number of existing homesale transactions as a percentage of U.S. households was approximately 4.4%, compared to an average of approximately 3.9% from 2007 through 2016. During the same period, the number of U.S. households grew from 94 million in 1991 to 126 million in 2016; and 


• | according to the 2016 State of the Nation's Housing Report compiled by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, household growth is projected to average over 1.3 million annually over the coming decade. The millennial generation is poised to form millions of new households over the next decade. 

Participation in Multiple Aspects of the Residential Real Estate Market
We participate in services associated with many aspects of the residential real estate market. Our four complementary businesses and mortgage joint venture work together, allowing us to generate revenue at various points in a residential real estate transaction, including the purchase or sale of homes, corporate relocation and affinity services, settlement and title services, and franchising of our brands. The businesses each benefit from our deep understanding of the industry, strong relationships with real estate brokers, sale associates and other real estate professionals and expertise across the transactional process. Unlike other industry participants who offer only one or two services, we can offer homeowners, our franchisees and our corporate and affinity clients ready access to numerous associated services that facilitate and simplify the home purchase and sale process. These services provide further revenue opportunities for our owned businesses and those of our franchisees. Specifically, our brokerage offices and those of our franchisees participate in purchases and sales of homes involving relocations of corporate transferees and affinity members using Cartus® relocation services and we offer customers (purchasers and sellers) of both our owned and franchised brokerage businesses convenient title and settlement services. These services produce incremental revenues for our businesses and franchisees. In addition, we participate in the mortgage process through our 49.9% ownership of PHH Home Loans. All four of our businesses and our mortgage joint venture can derive revenue from the same real estate transaction.

Real Estate Franchise Services 
Our primary objectives as the largest franchisor of residential real estate brokerages in the world are to sell new franchises, retain and expand existing franchises and most importantly, provide branding and support to our franchisees. At December 31, 2016, our real estate franchise systems had approximately 14,100 offices worldwide in 112 countries and territories in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Australia, including approximately 6,000 brokerage offices in the U.S.
We derive substantially all of our real estate franchising revenues from royalties received under long-term franchise agreements with our domestic franchisees (typically ten years in duration) and NRT. These royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees' sales commission earned from closed homesale sides (either the "buy" side and/or the "sell" side of a real estate transaction), which we refer to as gross commission income. Our franchisees pay us royalties, net of volume incentives achieved (other than NRT), for the right to operate under one of our trademarks and to utilize the benefits of the franchise systems. We provide our franchisees with systems and tools that are designed to help our franchisees serve their customers, attract new or retain existing independent sales associates, and support our franchisees with servicing programs, technology including the Zap® technology platform described under "Marketing and Technology," and education, as well as branding-related marketing which is funded through contributions by our franchisees and us (including NRT). We operate and maintain an Internet-based reporting system for our domestic franchisees which generally allows them to electronically transmit listing information and other relevant reporting data to our websites. We also own and operate websites for each of our brands for the benefit of our franchisees.

RFG's domestic annual net royalty revenues from franchisees other than our company owned brokerages can be represented by multiplying (1) that year's total number of closed homesale sides in which those franchisees participated by (2) the average sale price of those homesales by (3) the average brokerage commission rate charged by these franchisees by (4) RFG's net effective royalty rate. The net effective royalty rate represents the average percentage of our franchisees' commission revenues paid to us as a royalty, net of volume incentives achieved and does not include the effect of non-standard incentives granted to franchisees. Non-standard incentives may be used as consideration for new or renewing franchisees, however, most of our franchisees do not receive these non-standard incentives. In addition, in contrast to royalties and volume incentives, they are not homesale transaction based. We have accordingly excluded the non-standard incentives from the calculation of the net effective royalty rate. The domestic royalty revenue from NRT is calculated by multiplying homesale sides by average sale price by average brokerage commission rate by 6% royalty rate. NRT does not receive volume incentives or non-standard incentives. In addition to domestic royalty revenue, RFG earns revenue from marketing fees, the preferred alliance program, international affiliates and upfront international fees. The following chart illustrates the key drivers for revenue earned by RFG:
We believe one of our strengths is the strong relationships that we have with our franchisees as evidenced by the retention rate of 98% as of December 31, 2016. Our retention rate represents the annual franchisee gross commission income for the year ended December 31, 2015 generated by our franchisees that remain in our franchise systems as of December 31, 2016, measured against the annual gross commission income of all franchisees for the year ended December 31, 2015. On average, our domestic franchisees' tenure with our brands was approximately 21 years as of December 31, 2016. During 2016, none of our franchisees (other than NRT) generated more than 1% of our real estate franchise business revenues.
The franchise agreements impose restrictions on the business and operations of the franchisees and require them to comply with the operating and identity standards set forth in each brand's policy and procedures manuals. A franchisee's failure to comply with these restrictions and standards could result in a termination of the franchise agreement. The franchisees generally are not permitted to terminate the franchise agreements prior to their expiration, and in those cases where termination rights do exist, they are very limited (e.g., if the franchisee retires, becomes disabled or dies). Generally, new domestic franchise agreements have a term of ten years and require the franchisees to pay us an initial franchise fee for the franchisee's principal office plus, upon the receipt of any commission income, a royalty fee in most cases equal to 6% of their commission income. Each of our franchise systems (other than Coldwell Banker Commercial®) offers a volume incentive program, whereby each franchisee is eligible to receive a refund of a portion of the royalties paid upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The volume incentive is calculated for each eligible franchisee as a progressive percentage of each franchisee's annual gross revenue (paid timely) for each calendar year. Under the current form of the franchise agreements, the volume incentive varies for each franchise system, and generally ranges from zero to 3% of gross revenues. We provide a detailed table to each franchisee that describes the gross revenue thresholds required to achieve a volume incentive and the corresponding incentive amounts. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the percentage and/or dollar amounts in the table on an annual basis, subject to certain limitations. Our company owned brokerage offices do not participate in the volume incentive program.
Each franchise system requires all franchisees and company owned offices to make monthly contributions to marketing funds maintained by each brand. These contributions are used primarily for the development, implementation, production, placement and payment of national and regional advertising, marketing, promotions, public relations and/or other marketing-related activities, such as lead generation, all to promote and further the recognition of each brand and its independent franchisees. In addition to the contributions from franchisees and company owned offices, the Real Estate Franchise Services group is generally required to make contributions to one of the marketing funds and may make discretionary contributions (at its option) to any of the marketing funds.

The 2014 acquisition of ZipRealty reflects the Company's ongoing commitment to enhancing the value proposition we provide to our franchisees, including technology-enabled solutions. During 2016, we continued the roll out of our ZapLabs' comprehensive, integrated Zap technology platform and at December 31, 2016 had approximately 1,500 of our approximately 2,600 franchisees using the platform. Consistent with our previously disclosed plan, we anticipate rolling this product out to a majority of our remaining franchisees over the next twelve months. ZapLabs has developed the Zap technology platform from a real estate brokerage perspective to enhance the real estate transaction experience for customers, independent sales associates and our franchisees. We believe the Zap technology platform will increase the value proposition to our franchisees, their independent sales associates and their customers by: 

• | aiding in obtaining additional homesale transactions for our franchisees and their independent sales associates;


• | connecting those associates to a predictive customer relationship management (CRM) tool; and


• | informing them with valuable client insight to help those associates increase their productivity.

Under certain circumstances, we extend conversion notes (development advance notes were issued prior to 2009) to eligible franchisees for the purpose of providing an incentive to join the brand, to renew their franchise agreements, or to facilitate their growth opportunities. Growth opportunities include the expansion of franchisees' existing businesses by opening additional offices, through the consolidation of operations of other franchisees, as well as through the acquisition of independent sales associates and offices operated by independent brokerages. Many franchisees use the proceeds from the conversion notes to change stationery, signage and marketing materials, upgrade technology and websites, or to assist in acquiring companies or recruiting agents. The notes are not funded until appropriate credit checks and other due diligence matters are completed and the business is opened and operating under one of our brands. Upon satisfaction of certain revenue performance based thresholds, the notes are forgiven ratably over the term of the franchise agreement. If the revenue performance thresholds are not met, franchisees may be required to repay all or a portion of the outstanding notes.
In addition to offices owned and operated by our franchisees, we, through NRT, own and operate approximately 750 offices under the Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial® and Sotheby's International Realty® brand names. NRT pays intercompany royalty fees and marketing fees to our Real Estate Franchise Services Segment in connection with its operation of these offices. These fees are recognized as income or expense by the applicable segment level and eliminated in the consolidation of our businesses.
In the U.S., we employ a direct franchising model whereby we contract with and provide services directly to independent owner-operators.  Elsewhere, for all brands other than Sotheby's International Realty, we generally employ a master franchise model, whereby we contract with a qualified third party to build a franchise network in the country or region in which franchising rights have been granted. In the case of Sotheby's International Realty, a direct franchising model is generally utilized. Under both the direct and the master franchise model, we typically enter into long-term franchise agreements (often 25 years in duration) and receive an initial area development fee and ongoing royalties.  Under the master franchise model, the ongoing royalties we receive are generally a percentage of the royalties received by the master franchisor from its franchisees with which it contracts. Under the direct franchise model, a royalty fee is paid to us on transactions conducted by our franchisees in the applicable country or region. 
We also offer third-party service providers an opportunity to market their products to our franchisees and their independent sales associates and customers through our preferred alliance program. To participate in this program, service providers generally agree to provide preferred pricing to our franchisees and/or their customers or independent sales associates and to pay us a combination of an initial licensing or access fee, subsequent marketing fees and/or commissions based upon our franchisees' or independent sales associates' usage of the preferred alliance vendors. 
We own the trademarks Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, ERA® and related trademarks and logos, and such trademarks and logos are material to the businesses that are part of our real estate franchise segment. Our franchisees and our subsidiaries actively use these trademarks, and all of the material trademarks are registered (or have applications pending) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as well as with corresponding trademark offices in major countries worldwide where these businesses have significant operations.
We have an exclusive license to own, operate and franchise the Sotheby's International Realty® brand to qualified residential real estate brokerage offices and individuals operating in eligible markets pursuant to a license agreement with SPTC Delaware LLC, a subsidiary of Sotheby's ("Sotheby's"). Such license agreement has a 100-year term, which consists of an initial 50-year term ending February 16, 2054 and a 50-year renewal option. We pay a licensing fee to Sotheby's for the use of the Sotheby's International Realty® name equal to 9.5% of the net royalties earned by our Real Estate Franchise

Services Segment attributable to franchisees affiliated with the Sotheby's International Realty® brand, including our company owned offices.
In October 2007, we entered into a long-term license agreement to own, operate and franchise the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand from Meredith. The license agreement between Realogy and Meredith is for a 50-year term, with a renewal option for another 50 years at our option. We pay a licensing fee to Meridith for the use of the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand name equal to 9.0% of the net royalties earned by our Real Estate Franchise Services Segment, subject to a minimum annual licensing fee. 
Each of our brands has a consumer website that offers real estate listings, contacts and services. Century21.com, coldwellbanker.com, coldwellbankercommercial.com, sothebysrealty.com, era.com and bhgrealestate.com are the official websites for the Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, Sotheby's International Realty®, ERA® and Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate franchise systems, respectively. The contents of these websites are not incorporated by reference herein or otherwise a part of this Annual Report. 
Company Owned Real Estate Brokerage Services 
Through our subsidiary, NRT, we own and operate a full-service real estate brokerage business in more than 50 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our company owned real estate brokerage business operates under the Coldwell Banker® and Sotheby's International Realty® franchised brands as well as proprietary brands that we own, but do not currently franchise, such as Corcoran®, ZipRealty® and Citi HabitatsSM. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 790 company owned brokerage offices, approximately 5,200 employees and approximately 47,500 independent sales associates working with these company owned offices.
Our company owned real estate brokerage business derives revenue primarily from gross commission income received serving as the broker at the closing of real estate transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our average homesale broker commission rate was 2.46% which represents the average commission rate earned on either the "buy" side or the "sell" side of a homesale transaction. Gross commission income is also earned on non-sale transactions such as home rentals. NRT, as a franchisee of RFG, pays a royalty fee of 6% per transaction to RFG from the commission earned on a real estate transaction. The following chart illustrates the key drivers for revenue earned by NRT:
In addition, as a full-service real estate brokerage company, we promote the complementary services of our relocation and title and settlement services businesses, as well as PHH Home Loans. We believe we provide integrated services that enhance the customer experience.
When we assist the seller in a real estate transaction, independent sales associates generally provide the seller with a full-service marketing program, which may include developing a direct marketing plan for the property, assisting the seller in pricing the property and preparing it for sale, listing it on multiple listing services, advertising the property (including on websites), showing the property to prospective buyers, assisting the seller in sale negotiations, and assisting the seller in preparing for closing the transaction. When we assist the buyer in a real estate transaction, independent sales associates generally help the buyer in locating specific properties that meet the buyer's personal and financial specifications, show properties to the buyer, assist the buyer in negotiating (where permissible) and preparing for closing the transaction.
At December 31, 2016, we operated approximately 90% of our offices under the Coldwell Banker® brand name, 5% of our offices under the Sotheby's International Realty® brand name and 5% of our offices under the Corcoran®, Citi HabitatsSM and ZipRealty® brand names combined. Our offices are geographically diverse with a strong presence in the east and west coast areas, where home prices are generally higher. We operate our Coldwell Banker® offices in numerous regions throughout the U.S., our Sotheby's International Realty® offices in several regions throughout the U.S, and Corcoran® offices in New York City, the Hamptons (New York), and Palm Beach, Florida.
We intend to grow our business both organically and through strategic acquisitions. To grow organically, we will focus on working with office managers to attract, retain and effectively coordinate with independent sales associates who can 
11

successfully engage and promote transactions from new and existing clients. To complement our residential brokerage services, NRT offers home ownership services that include comprehensive single-family residential property management in many of the nation's largest rental markets.
We are continuously evaluating acquisitions that will allow us to enter into new markets and to profitably expand our existing markets through "tuck-in" acquisitions. Following the completion of an acquisition, we tend to consolidate the newly acquired operations with our existing operations. By consolidating operations, we reduce or eliminate duplicative costs, such as advertising, rent and administrative support. By utilizing our existing infrastructure to coordinate with a broader network of independent sales associates and revenue base, we can enhance the profitability of our operations. We also seek to enhance the profitability of newly acquired operations by strategies that increase the productivity of the newly affiliated independent sales associates. We offer these independent sales associates supplemental tools and marketing information that are often unavailable at smaller firms, such as access to sophisticated information technology and ongoing technical support, increased brand advertising and brand marketing support, relocation referrals, and a wide offering of brokerage-related services.
Our real estate brokerage business has a contract with Cartus under which the brokerage business provides brokerage services to relocating employees of the clients of Cartus. When receiving a referral from Cartus, our brokerage business seeks to assist the relocating employee in completing a homesale or home purchase. Upon completion of a homesale or home purchase, our brokerage business receives a commission on the purchase or sale of the property and is obligated to pay Cartus a portion of such commission as a referral fee. We believe that these fees are comparable to the fees charged by other relocation companies.
PHH Home Loans, our home mortgage venture with PHH, a publicly traded company, has a 50-year term, subject to earlier termination. We own 49.9% of the home mortgage venture and PHH owns the remaining 50.1%. All mortgage loans originated by the venture are sold to PHH or other third-party investors after a hold period, and PHH Home Loans does not hold any mortgage loans for investment purposes or perform servicing functions for any loans it originates. Accordingly, we have no mortgage servicing rights asset risk. See Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" under the heading "Recent Developments" for information regarding the formation of our new mortgage origination joint venture.
Relocation Services 
Through our subsidiary, Cartus, we are a leading global provider of outsourced employee relocation services. We primarily offer corporate clients employee relocation services, such as:

• | homesale assistance, including:


◦ | the valuation, inspection, purchasing and selling of a transferee's home;


◦ | the issuance of home equity advances to transferees permitting them to purchase a new home before selling their current home (these advances are generally guaranteed by the client);


◦ | certain home management services;


◦ | assistance in locating a new home; and


◦ | closing on the sale of the old home, generally at the instruction of the client;


• | expense processing, relocation policy counseling, relocation-related accounting, including international assignment compensation services, and other consulting services;


• | arranging household goods moving services, approximately 64,000 domestic and international shipments in 2016, and providing support for all aspects of moving a transferee's household goods, including the handling of insurance and claim assistance, invoice auditing and quality control;


• | coordinating visa and immigration support, intercultural and language training, and expatriation/repatriation counseling and destination services; and


• | group move management services providing coordination for moves involving a large number of transferees to or from a specific regional area over a short period of time.

The wide range of our services allows our Cartus clients to outsource their entire relocation programs to us.
In 2016, we assisted in approximately 163,000 corporate and affinity relocations in nearly 150 countries for approximately 800 active clients, including 56% of the Fortune 50 companies as well as affinity organizations. Cartus has 
12

operations in the U.S. and internationally in the United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, India, Brazil, Germany, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
Substantially all homesale service transactions for clients are classified as "no risk." Under "no risk" business, the client is responsible for reimbursement of all direct expenses associated with the homesale. Such expenses include, but are not limited to, appraisal, inspection and real estate brokerage commissions. The client also bears the risk of loss on the resale of the transferee's home. Clients are responsible for reimbursement of all other direct costs associated with the relocation including, but not limited to, costs to move household goods, mortgage origination points, temporary living and travel expenses. Generally, we fund the direct expenses associated with the homesale as well as those associated with the relocation on behalf of the client and the client then reimburses us for these costs plus interest charges on the advanced funds. This limits our exposure on "no risk" homesale services to the credit risk of our clients rather than to the potential fluctuations in the real estate market or to the creditworthiness of the individual transferring employee. Historically, due to the credit quality of our clients, we have had minimal losses with respect to these "no risk" homesale services.
The "at risk" business that we conduct is minimal. In "at risk" homesale service transactions, we acquire the home being sold by relocating employees, incur the cost for all direct expenses (acquisition, carrying and selling costs) associated with the homesale and bear any loss on the sale of the home.
Substantially all of our contracts with our relocation clients are terminable at any time at the option of the client and are non-exclusive. If a client terminates its contract, we will be compensated for all services performed up to the time of termination and reimbursed for all expenses incurred to the time of termination.
There are a number of different revenue streams associated with relocation services. We earn referral commissions primarily from real estate brokers and household goods moving companies that provide services to the transferee. Clients may also pay transactional fees for the services performed. We also earn net interest income which represents interest earned from clients on the funds we advance on behalf of the transferring employee net of costs associated with the securitization obligations used to finance these payments. Cartus measures operating performance based on initiations, which represent the total number of transferees and affinity members we serve, and referrals, which represent the number of referrals from which we earn revenue from real estate brokers. 
About 15% of our relocation revenue in 2016 was derived from our affinity services, which provides real estate services, including home buying and selling assistance, as well as mortgage assistance to organizations such as insurance companies and credit unions that have established members who are buying or selling a home. Often these organizations offer our affinity services to their members at no cost and, where permitted, provide their members with a financial incentive for using these services. These member benefits and services help the organizations attract new members and retain current members.
We also manage the Cartus Broker Network, which is a network of real estate brokers consisting of our company owned brokerage operations, select franchisees and independent real estate brokers who have been approved to become members. Cartus requires experienced brokers and independent sales associates and obtains background checks on all members of the network. Member brokers of the Cartus Broker Network receive referrals from our relocation services, affinity business and each other in exchange for a referral fee. The Cartus Broker Network closed approximately 79,000 real estate transactions in 2016 related to relocation, affinity, and broker-to-broker activity. 
The following chart illustrates the key drivers for revenue generated by Cartus:

Title and Settlement Services 
Our title and settlement services business, TRG, provides full-service title and settlement (i.e., closing and escrow) services to real estate companies and financial institutions. We act in the capacity of a title agent and sell title insurance to property buyers and mortgage lenders. We are licensed as a title agent in 42 states and Washington, D.C., and have physical locations in 25 states and Washington, D.C. We issue title insurance policies on behalf of large national underwriters as well as through our Dallas-based subsidiary, Title Resources Guaranty Company ("Title Resources"). Title Resources is a title insurance underwriter licensed in 29 states and Washington, D.C. We operate mostly in major metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 439 offices, approximately 221 of which are co-located within one of our company owned brokerage offices.
Virtually all lenders require their borrowers to obtain title insurance policies at the time mortgage loans are made on real property. The terms and conditions upon which the real property will be insured are determined in accordance with the standard policies and procedures of the title underwriter. When our title agencies sell title insurance, the title search and examination function is performed by the agent. The title agent and underwriter split the premium. The amount of such premium "split" is determined by agreement between the agency and underwriter, or is promulgated by state law. We derive revenue through fees charged in real estate transactions for rendering the services described above, fees charged for escrow and closing services, and a percentage of the title premium on each title insurance policy sold. We have entered into underwriting agreements with various underwriters, which state the conditions under which we may issue a title insurance policy on their behalf. For policies issued through our agency operations, assuming no negligence on our part, we are not typically liable for losses under those policies; rather the title insurer is typically liable for such losses. 
Our company owned brokerage operations are the principal source of our title and settlement services business for homesale transactions. Other sources of our title and settlement services homesale business include our real estate franchise business, Cartus and unaffiliated brokerage operations. For refinance transactions, we generate title and escrow revenues from PHH and other financial institutions throughout the mortgage lending industry. Many of our offices have subleased space from, and are co-located within, our company owned brokerage offices. The capture rate of our title and settlement services business from company owned brokerage operations was approximately 41% in 2016.
We coordinate a national network of escrow and closing agents (some of whom are our employees, while others are attorneys in private practice and independent title companies) to provide full-service title and settlement services to a broad-based group that includes lenders, home buyers and sellers, developers and independent real estate sales associates. Our role is generally that of an intermediary managing the completion of all the necessary documentation and services required to complete a real estate transaction.
Our title and settlement services business measures operating performance based on purchase and refinance closing units and the related title premiums and escrow fees earned on such closings. In addition, we measure net title premiums earned for title policies issued by our underwriting operation. 
The following chart illustrates the key drivers for revenue generated by our title and settlement services business:
We intend to grow our title and settlement services business by attracting title and escrow sales associates in existing markets and by completing acquisitions to expand our geographic footprint or complement existing operations. We also intend to continue to increase our capture rate of title business from our NRT homesale sides. In addition, we expect to continue to grow and diversify our lender channel and our underwriting businesses by expanding and adding clients and increasing our agent base, respectively.

Competition 
Real Estate Brokerage Industry. The residential real estate brokerage industry is highly competitive with low barriers to entry for new participants. Recruitment and retention of independent sales associates and independent sales associate teams are critical to the business and financial results of a brokerage—whether or not they are affiliated with a franchisor. Most of a brokerage's real estate listings are sourced through the sphere of influence of their independent sales associates, notwithstanding the growing influence of internet-generated leads. Competition for independent sales associates in our industry is high and has intensified particularly with respect to more productive independent sales associates.  Competition for independent sales associates is generally subject to numerous factors, including remuneration (such as sales commission percentage and other financial incentives paid to independent sales associates), other expenses charged to independent sales associates, leads or business opportunities generated for the independent sales associate from the brokerage, independent sales associates' perception of the value of the broker's brand affiliation, marketing and advertising efforts by the brokerage, the office manager, staff and fellow independent sales associates with whom they collaborate daily and technology, continuing professional education, and other services provided by the brokerage. See "Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Drivers" for a discussion of the various compensation models being utilized by real estate brokerages to compensate their independent sales associates. 
According to NAR, approximately 41% of individual brokers and independent sales associates are affiliated with a franchisor. Competition among the national real estate brokerage brand franchisors to grow their franchise systems is intense. We believe that competition for the sale of franchises in the real estate brokerage industry is based principally upon the perceived value that the franchisor provides to enhance the franchisee's ability to grow its business and improve the recruitment, retention and productivity of its independent sales associates. The value provided by a franchisor encompasses many different aspects including the quality of the brand, tools, technology, marketing and other services, such as the availability of financing, provided to the franchisees, and the fees the franchisees must pay. Our largest national competitors in this industry include, but are not limited to, three large franchisors: Keller Williams Realty, Inc.; HSF Affiliates LLC (a joint venture controlled by HomeServices of America that operates Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, Prudential Real Estate and Real Living Real Estate); and RE/MAX International, Inc. 
Our Company owned brokerages compete with national independent real estate brokerages, franchisees of national and regional real estate franchisors -- including our own brands and the other national franchisors described in the preceding paragraph -- regional independent real estate brokerages and discount and limited service brokerages. We and others within the industry also encounter competition from companies employing technologies intended to disrupt the traditional brokerage model including the elimination of brokers or agents from the transaction. 
The ability of our real estate brokerage franchisees and our company owned brokerage businesses to successfully compete is important to our prospects for growth. Their ability to compete may be affected by the performance of independent sales associates, the location of offices and target markets, the services provided to independent sales associates, the fees charged to independent sales associates, the number and nature of competing offices in the vicinity, affiliation with a recognized brand name, community reputation, technology and other factors. A franchisee's success may also be affected by national, regional and local economic conditions.
We estimate that our U.S. market share of all existing homesale transaction volume was approximately 15.7% in 2016, a decline of approximately 1.0% since 2014 and that our U.S. market share for all existing homesale transactions was approximately 13.5% in 2016, a decline of approximately 0.4% since 2014. We measure our market share transaction volume by the ratio of (a) the existing homesale transaction volume in which we and our franchisees participate to (b) NAR's existing homesale transaction volume—calculated by doubling the number of existing homesale transactions reported by NAR to account for both the buy and sell sides of a transaction multiplied by average sales price. Transaction market share is calculated similarly but without including average sales price in either the numerator or denominator. 
Relocation Business. Competition in our relocation business is based on capabilities, price and quality. We compete primarily with global and regional outsourced relocation services providers. The larger outsourced relocation services providers that we compete with include Brookfield Global Relocation Services, SIRVA, Inc. and Weichert Relocation Resources, Inc. As the relocation business continues to become more global in nature with greater emphasis on relocation of employees throughout the world, we expect to face greater competition from firms that provide global services.
Title and Settlement Business. The title and settlement business is highly competitive and fragmented. The number and size of competing companies vary in the different areas in which we conduct business. We compete with other title insurers, title agents and vendor management companies. The title and settlement business competes with a large, fragmented group of smaller underwriters and agencies. In addition, we compete with the various brands of national 
15

competitors including Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, First American Title Insurance Company, Stewart Title Guaranty Company and Old Republic Title Company.
Marketing and Technology 
Real Estate Franchise Operations. Each of our franchise brands operates a marketing fund that is funded by our franchisees and us. The primary focus of each marketing fund is to build and maintain brand awareness, which is accomplished through a variety of media, including increased use of Internet advertising. Our Internet presence, for the most part, features our entire listing inventory on our brand websites in our regional and national markets, plus community profiles, home buying and selling advice, relocation tips and mortgage financing information. Each brand manages a comprehensive system of marketing tools, systems and sales information and data that can be accessed through free-standing brand intranet sites to assist independent sales associates in becoming the best marketer of their listings. In addition to the Sotheby's International Realty® brand, a leading luxury brand, our franchisees and our company owned brokerages also participate in luxury marketing programs, such as Century 21 Fine Homes & Estates®, Coldwell Banker Previews International®, ERA® International Collection and Better Homes and Gardens® real estate Distinctive Collection.
According to NAR, among buyers who used the Internet during their home search, 89% of buyers found photos and 85% found detailed information about properties for sale very useful. Advertising is primarily used by the brands to drive consumers to their respective websites. Significant focus is placed on developing websites for each brand to create value to the real estate consumer. Each brand website focuses on streamlined, easy search processes for listing inventory and rich descriptive details and multiple photos to market the real estate listing. Additionally, each brand website serves as a national distribution point for independent sales associates to market themselves to consumers to enhance the customer experience. We also place significant emphasis on distributing our real estate listings with third-party websites to expand a homebuyer's access to such listings, at times enhancing the presentation of the listings on third-party websites to make the listings more attractive to consumers. Consumers seeking more detailed information about a particular listing on a third-party website are able to click through to a brand website or a company owned brokerage website or telephone the franchisee or company owned brokerage directly.
In order to improve our response times to buyers and sellers seeking real estate services, we developed LeadRouter™, our proprietary patented lead management system. We believe LeadRouter provides a competitive advantage by improving the speed at which a brokerage can begin working with a customer. The system converts text to voice and transfers the lead to our agents within a matter of seconds, providing our agents with the ability to quickly respond to the needs of a potential home buyer or seller. Additionally, LeadRouter provides the broker with an accountability tool to manage their associates and evaluate productivity.
The 2014 acquisition of ZipRealty reflects the Company's ongoing commitment to enhancing the value proposition we provide to our franchisees, including technology-enabled solutions. During 2016, we continued the roll out of our ZapLabs' comprehensive, integrated Zap technology platform and at December 31, 2016 had approximately 1,500 of our approximately 2,600 franchisees using the platform. Consistent with our previously disclosed plan, we anticipate rolling this product out to a majority of our remaining franchisees over the next twelve months. We believe the Zap technology platform will increase the value proposition to our franchisees, their independent sales associates and their customers by: 

• | aiding in obtaining additional homesale transactions for our franchisees and their independent sales associates;


• | connecting those associates to a predictive customer relationship management (CRM) tool; and


• | informing them with valuable client insight to help those associates increase their productivity.

ZapLabs has developed the Zap technology platform from a real estate brokerage perspective to enhance the real estate transaction experience for customers, independent sales associates and our franchisees.
Company Owned Brokerage Operations. Our company owned brokerages sponsor a wide array of marketing programs, materials and opportunities to complement the sales work of our affiliated independent sales associates and increase brand awareness. The effectiveness and quality of marketing programs play a significant role in attracting and retaining independent sales associates.
NRT's sponsored marketing programs and initiatives primarily focus on attracting potential new home buyers and sellers to NRT's affiliated independent sales associates. These programs and initiatives also complement the awareness of our brands by increasing the local recognition of our agents and local brokerages.
16

Much of our marketing efforts are geared toward showcasing the inventory of our real estate listings and the affiliated independent sales associates who are the selling agents of these listings. In addition to prominently placing the listing property and related selling agent information on numerous real estate websites, we promote the selling agents and their properties on social media sites and offer tools and systems intended to enhance the home buying and home selling experiences of our customers. We also offer the independent sales associates broad-based advertising, mailings and other campaigns to generate leads, interest and recognition.
The Internet has become the primary advertising channel in our industry and we have sought to become a leader among full-service residential real estate brokerage firms in the use and application of marketing technology. We place our property listings on hundreds of real estate websites and we operate a variety of our own websites.
NRT also utilizes both proprietary and third-party technology to offer independent sales associates tools that may enhance their productivity and increase their understanding of their local markets and the impact of their marketing efforts. Some of these tools include the HomeBase Transaction Management and InTouch CRM systems, as well as MarketQuest and e-Marketing reporting tools.
Education
Each real estate brand provides continuing education materials to its franchisees to assist them in ongoing business operations. Each brand's engagement program contains different materials and delivery methods. The marketing materials include a detailed description of the services offered by our franchise systems (which will be available to the independent sales associate). Live instructors at conventions and orientation seminars deliver some engagement modules while other modules can be viewed by brokers anywhere in the world through virtual classrooms over the Internet. Most of the programs and materials are then made available in electronic form to franchisees over the respective system's private intranet site. Many of the materials are customizable to allow franchisees to achieve a personalized look and feel and make modifications to certain content as appropriate for their business and marketplace.
Employees 
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 11,800 employees, including approximately 830 employees outside of the U.S. None of our employees are represented by a union. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Government Regulation 
Franchise Regulation. In the U.S., the sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws, as well as by the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"). The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. A number of states require registration and/or disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales. In addition, several states have "franchise relationship laws" or "business opportunity laws" that limit the ability of the franchisor to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. The states with relationship or other statutes governing the termination of franchises include Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands also have statutes governing termination of franchises. Some franchise relationship statutes require a mandated notice period for termination and some require a notice and cure period. In addition, some require that the franchisor demonstrate good cause for termination. These statutes do not have a substantial effect on our operations because our franchise agreements generally comport with the statutory requirements for cause for termination, and they provide notice and cure periods for most defaults. When the franchisee is granted a statutory period longer than permitted under the franchise agreement, we extend our notice and/or cure periods to match the statutory requirements. In some states, case law requires a franchisor to renew a franchise agreement unless a franchisee has given cause for non-renewal. Failure to comply with these laws could result in civil liability to the affected franchisees. While our franchising operations have not been materially adversely affected by such existing regulation, we cannot predict the effect of any future federal or state legislation or regulation. Internationally, many countries have similar laws affecting franchising.
Real Estate Regulation.  RESPA and state real estate brokerage laws restrict payments which real estate brokers, title agencies, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers and other settlement service providers may receive or pay in connection with the sales of residences and referral of settlement services (e.g., mortgages, homeowners insurance and title insurance). Such laws may to some extent impose limitations on preferred alliance and other arrangements involving our real estate franchise, real estate brokerage, settlement services and relocation businesses or the business of our mortgage origination joint venture. In addition, with respect to our company owned real estate brokerage, relocation and title and settlement services businesses 
17

as well as our mortgage origination joint venture, RESPA and similar state laws require timely disclosure of certain relationships or financial interests with providers of real estate settlement services. 
RESPA and related regulations do, however, contain a number of provisions that allow for payments or fee splits between providers, including fee splits between brokers and agents and market-based fees for the provision of actual goods or services.  In addition, RESPA allows for referrals to affiliated entities, including joint ventures, when specific requirements have been met.  We rely on these provisions in conducting our business activities and believe our arrangements comply with RESPA.  RESPA compliance, however, has become a greater challenge in recent years for most industry participants offering settlement services, including mortgage companies, title companies and brokerages, because of changes in the regulatory environment and expansive interpretation of RESPA or similar state statutes by certain courts. 
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank"), administration of RESPA has been moved from the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"). The CFPB has taken a much stricter approach toward interpretation of RESPA and related regulations than HUD and has significantly increased the use of enforcement proceedings.  In the face of this changing regulatory landscape, various industry participants, while disagreeing with the CFPB’s narrow interpretation of RESPA, have nevertheless decided to modify or terminate long-standing business arrangements to avoid the risk of protracted and costly litigation defending such arrangements. Beyond the CFPB enforcement practices, the new practices have triggered private RESPA litigation, including an action filed against us, our joint venture and PHH that is described in Note 14, "Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation", to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, and narrower interpretations of state statutes similar to RESPA and enforcement proceedings of those statutes by state regulatory authorities.
Our company owned real estate brokerage business is also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that contain general standards for and limitations on the conduct of real estate brokers and sales associates, including those relating to the licensing of brokers and sales associates, fiduciary and agency duties, administration of trust funds, collection of commissions, restrictions on information sharing with affiliates, fair housing standards and advertising and consumer disclosures. Under state law, our company owned real estate brokers have certain duties to supervise and are responsible for the conduct of their brokerage businesses. Although real estate sales associates historically have been classified as independent contractors, newer rules and interpretations of state and federal employment laws and regulations, including those governing employee classification and wage and hour regulations, may impact industry practices and our company owned brokerage operations. Real estate licensing laws generally permit brokers to engage sales associates as independent contractors but require that the broker supervise their activities. 
Regulation of Title Insurance and Settlement Services. Many states license and regulate title agencies/settlement service providers or certain employees and underwriters through their Departments of Insurance or other regulatory body. In many states, title insurance rates are either promulgated by the state or are required to be filed with each state by the agent or underwriter, and some states promulgate the split of title insurance premiums between the agent and underwriter. States sometimes unilaterally lower the insurance rates relative to loss experience and other relevant factors. States also require title agencies and title underwriters to meet certain minimum financial requirements for net worth and working capital. In addition, the insurance laws and regulations of Texas, the jurisdiction in which our title insurance underwriter subsidiary, TRGC, is domiciled, generally provide that no person may acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a Texas domiciled insurer, unless the person has provided required information to, and the acquisition is approved or not disapproved by, the Texas Department of Insurance. Generally, any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 10% or more of our voting securities would be presumed to have acquired indirect control of our title insurance underwriter subsidiary unless the Texas Department of Insurance, upon application, determines otherwise. Our insurance underwriter is also subject to a holding company act in its state of domicile, which regulates, among other matters, investment policies and the ability to pay dividends.
Certain states in which we operate have "controlled business" statutes which impose limitations on affiliations between providers of title and settlement services, on the one hand, and real estate brokers, mortgage lenders and other real estate service providers, on the other hand. We are aware of the states imposing such limits and monitor the others to ensure that if they implement such a limit that we will be prepared to comply with any such rule. "Controlled business" typically is defined as sources controlled by, or which control, directly or indirectly, the title insurer or agent. Pursuant to legislation enacted in the State of New York in late 2014 requiring the licensing of title agents, the New York Department of Insurance has issued regulations that provide that title agents with affiliated businesses may not accept referrals from affiliated sources unless they also have significant and multiple sources of non-affiliated business. We are not aware of any other recent or pending controlled business legislation. A company's failure to comply with such statutes could result in the non-renewal of 
18

the Company's license to provide title and settlement services. We provide our services not only to our affiliates but also to third-party businesses in the geographic areas in which we operate. Accordingly, we manage our business in a manner to comply with any applicable "controlled business" statutes by ensuring that we generate sufficient business from sources we do not control. We have never been cited for failing to comply with a "controlled business" statute.
Dodd-Frank Act. Dodd-Frank endows the CFPB with rule making, examination and enforcement authority involving consumer financial products and services, including mortgage finance.  The CFPB has issued a myriad of proposed and final rules which could materially and adversely affect the mortgage and housing industries.  Dodd-Frank establishes new standards and practices for mortgage originators, including determining a prospective borrower's ability to repay its mortgage and restricting the fees that mortgage originators may collect.
