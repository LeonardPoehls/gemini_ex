ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
 
BACKGROUND
 
Duo World, Inc. (“we,” the “Company” or “Duo World”) is an information technology and software solutions company, focused on bringing value to its clients through customer interactions.
 
Duo World has its registered office in Nevada, United States, and its development center in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Duo World specializes in communication and collaboration platforms for customers who require any form of engagement with their clients, including, but not limited to, customer life cycle management, customer care, and contact center management. The Company also provides cloud-based subscription management and billing systems and a business intelligence and data visualization tool. Duo World has served its customers in many ways, including improved efficiency, cost reduction, revenue optimization and value added product and service offerings.
 
Duo World’s communications and collaboration platform is used by some of the largest banks, retail chains, Pay-TV operators, financial conglomerates, and taxi hailing startups in Sri Lanka. India’s largest digital cable TV operator and Indonesia’s growing direct-to-home (“DTH”) operators benefit by implementing Duo World’s Subscriber Management and Billing System for their operations.
 
Duo World, Inc. was formed as a Nevada corporation in 2014 for the purpose of acquiring three operating entities: (i) Duo Software (Pvt.) Limited, a Sri Lankan company (“Duo Software Sri Lanka”), from Mr. Muhunthan Canagasooryam, Duo World’s President and founder, in exchange for 28,000,000 shares of our common stock and 5,000,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock; (ii) Duo Software (Pte.) Limited, a Singaporean company (“Duo Software Singapore”), from Ms. Koshala Nishaharan, in exchange for 2,000,000 shares of our common stock; and (iii) Duo Software India (Private) Limited, an India company (“Duo Software India”). Duo Software India is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Duo Software Singapore. These acquisitions were accomplished as of December 3, 2014.
 
Duo Software Sri Lanka was incorporated on September 22, 2004 in the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, as a limited liability company under the Sri Lanka Companies Act No. 17 of 1982, and was subsequently reregistered under the Sri Lanka Companies Act No. 7 of 2007, in compliance with the New Companies Act, which came into effect in 2007.
 
Duo Software Singapore was incorporated on June 5, 2007 in the Republic of Singapore under the Companies Act (Cap 50. 1994 Rev. Ed).
 
Duo Software India was incorporated on August 30, 2007, under the Companies Act of 1956 in the Republic of India and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Duo Software Singapore.

Our Business and Products 
 
Duo World is a software product development company focused on providing enterprise solutions simplified through our cloud offering and by use of cutting edge technology.
 
The experience and market insight gained by Duo World through its more than a decade of existence in the software industry caused us to think globally and futuristically to focus on new product development to cater to ever evolving and growing business needs.
 
Eventually, our Customer Life Cycle Management and Contact Center solution transformed into a futuristic cloud Communication and Collaboration Platform. Our Subscription Management and Billing System, which was primarily catering to the large digital Pay-TV operators, transformed into an Application Program Interface (“API”) driven cloud Subscription Management and Billing System.
 
“FaceTone” is a cloud communications and collaborations platform which is being offered through public/private cloud and on site implementations as per business preferences.
 
Our FaceTone enterprise version was launched in October 2016 and the product has gained momentum in the market by acquiring the largest home grown taxi hailing start up, the largest private bank, one of the largest financial conglomerate which became the most profitable listed company in 2017, and the largest private telecommunication service provider in Sri Lanka to its client portfolio.

FaceTone has also been implemented at some of the existing clients of Duo World, which include the largest government bank, some of the medium size private banks, the largest fixed telecommunication providers and the largest retail chain in Sri Lanka.
 
FaceTone showcased its excellence by winning the Gold Award under the “Communications Applications” category in The National Best Quality ICT Awards 2016 (NBQSA), an annual event organized by the BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT Sri Lanka, qualifying to participate in Asia Pacific ICT Awards (APICTA) hosted by Asia Pacific ICT Alliance Awards 2016 held in Taipei, Taiwan where FaceTone won a merit award in reinforcing itself as an innovative solution once again.
 
“CloudCharge” is an API driven Cloud Subscription Management and Billing System that caters to any business that operates in the space of subscription economy. CloudCharge is to be commercially launched by the fourth quarter of 2018
 
Duo World commercially launched the enterprise version of DigIn in Sri Lanka in June 2017, and the SaaS version of DigIn is to be launched during the fourth quarter of 2018.
 
Other ancillary product of Duo World that is in completion, and to be launched is, Smoothflow. We plan to launch Smoothflow in the fourth quarter of 2018.
 
All of the products are initially launched in Sri Lanka (as a test bed) and then taken to other countries
 
Most of our product development, research and development, global support center, project management, business process and implementation, finance and treasury and human resource management functions are conducted and managed through Duo Software Sri Lanka.
 
Duo Software Singapore was established primarily for the purpose of marketing of our enterprise versions DuoSubscribe and DuoCLM when they were launched in 2008. Duo Software Singapore has been highly instrumental in generating successful sales leads through its presence at trade exhibitions and in following up sales leads in the region.
 
Duo Software India was established for the purposes of having a dedicated team in India to promote and support the enterprise versions of DuoSubscribe and DuoCLM when it was launched in 2008. India is the world’s second most populated country and has a large number of Pay TV operators in the subscription economy in India.
 
Duo Software India has been successful in penetrating the Pay TV industry, and enterprise versions of DuoSubscribe and DuoCLM are being employed as the operation platform by some of the dominant Pay TV operators in New Delhi, and Kolkata, India, such as DEN Networks Limited, India’s largest cable TV distribution company serving 13 million homes in over 200 cities.
 
At present, Duo Software India has curtailed promoting DuoSubscribe and DuoCLM, and is at the verge of launching FaceTone in India, primarily to the Telecommunication industry.
 
Industry and Market
 
While Duo World initially developed its software for use by clients as an enterprise or on premises model, the information technology climate is changing in dramatic fashion as a result of cloud based, SaaS solutions and technology. Duo World fully grasps these changing dynamics and market forces, and intends to use its technical expertise, technology and other resources to exploit cloud based, SaaS solutions in order to compete within our industry.
 
The communication and collaboration software is where the solution facilitates hosted applications via private/public clouds or through an on premise implementation model.

While Duo World would primarily focus on the cloud model to acquire the market influencers and startups where the revenue will be on a monthly/annually subscription model, the on premise solution will be made available for brick and mortar companies, who have their own infrastructure to implement the system in house. For the on premise version, our pricing would be based on either a one-time investment pricing with annual support fee or a monthly/annual user license subscription basis as preferred by the customer.
 
Communication and Collaboration will facilitate running a comprehensive modern age customer support system featuring omni-channel delivery. It provides sales teams the convenience of contacting their customers from anywhere and on any device, add their own task and manage a customer’s profile. FaceTone would also enable efficient internal communication between teams through its voice, messaging and collaboration platform.
 
FaceTone proves to be a solution for any industry and organization to uplift their communication with external stakeholders such as clients and internal communication within teams; hence, the market size promises to be significantly large and unfolds bigger opportunities for Duo World to achieve market leadership with the right product at the right time.
 
The subscription based software industry is an industry where software applications are hosted on a public or private cloud platform and services are provided on a monthly subscription model known as “Software as a Service” or “SaaS.” SaaS is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted on the cloud by independent software vendors or application service providers. Unlike traditional software applications which are conventionally sold as a perpetual license with an up-front fee and an annual fee charged for support, SaaS providers price their applications using a subscription fee, payable monthly or on a transaction basis. The subscription model allows organizations to access the applications without having to pay a large upfront fee, thereby increasing the potential user base.
 
The subscription industry has recently experienced phenomenal growth and is forecasted to continue to grow in the future. Subscriptions are no longer limited to cable TV, newspapers and magazines. During the past ten years, there has been a dramatic shift in the way both consumers and companies do business and more companies are using the subscription model to offer everything from music, movies and textbooks to even automobiles for a monthly fee. Many traditional organizations are joining the subscription economy in response to changing consumer habits, as many consumers today value the convenience and flexibility of subscribing for services or access to products more than having to purchase products or services.
 
Our Products and Our Transformation to Cloud Based, SaaS Solutions
 
In response to the changing dynamics discussed under “Industry and Market,” above, we have been diligently transforming our business model by developing new products and enhancing our current products for the cloud-based, Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) market.
 
With Duo World transforming its business toward cloud-based, SaaS, product deployments, we are employing a strategic market approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant and consistent content to attract new and retain a clearly defined clientele with the goal of ultimately driving profitable customer action via content marketing.
 
While we move toward cloud-based solutions, Duo World will continue to cater all of our products to the profitable enterprise segments, as well. And, as is the case with most of our products, the enterprise version will be launched first in Sri Lanka and the region (as a test bed), prior to being launched in other countries and as a SaaS.
 
In addition, our cloud-based solutions will reduce implementation and change request costs, while improving product profitability. Duo World will focus more on product innovation than on deploying our resources and efforts on solving customer specific issues and accepting additional development requests from individual customers.

Instead of catering our products to limited industries in a particular region or country, our new products will allow us to cater to a more diversified audience that can be reached through our cloud presence, which can be accessed by any user via the internet, regardless of where they are located. We believe that our transformation from on premises/enterprise solutions to cloud based, SaaS solutions will expose us to a greater number of potential customers and reduce our reliance on a few large enterprise customers.
 
Our transformation to a cloud-based, SaaS business is not without some small degree of risk, as we could lose some of the personal interaction with our customers, as all of our services will be offered via digital communications (e.g., email, blogs, service tickets and telephone), which could impact customer loyalty. In order to overcome this risk, we are investing in improving our global support operation and ensuring that proper attention and very professional services are provided to our customers as and when the need arises to provide additional customer support. However, our management does not believe that such risk is material.
 
FaceTone
 
In the past, we offered DuoCLM as an enterprise or on-premise solution to large organizations that have dedicated customer support call centers to maintain their customer relationships. It was designed to manage the entire customer life cycle from the initial contact point with a customer to ongoing support.
 
We launched FaceTone in October 2016 to offer a significantly enhanced model of DuoCLM. As a result, we no longer market DuoCLM. FaceTone is a communication and collaboration platform that provides the capability of operating on-premise or cloud-based PABX, IVR or call center, efficiently. A PABX is a private automatic branch exchange and automatic telephone switching system. An IVR is an interactive voice response system that interacts with callers, gathers information and routes calls to the appropriate recipients.
 
FaceTone for PABX provides advanced features such as call conferencing, call parking, call forwarding, voicemail and more. FaceTone for call centers provides the capability to run a fully functional contact center with added features such as call routing and chat-based collaboration like Facebook, Viber and Skype. FaceTone also uses artificial intelligence to facilitate automated customer communication.
 
The on-premise and Partner versions of FaceTone were launched in 2016. The Partner solution is a hosted solution that operates similarly to a SaaS product from the client’s perspective. Under the Partner solution, we partner with leading telecom operators who host our FaceTone solution in their data center and offer the solution to their enterprise customers as a value added subscription service, with sales and support then provided by the telecom partner on an ongoing basis.
 
We expect to launch the separate SaaS version of FaceTone by the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We are also currently developing an add-on feature for FaceTone, which will utilize blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and authenticity of contracts entered into and maintained by our customers.
 
CloudCharge
 
Our DuoSubscribe product, offered as an enterprise or on-premise solution, specialized in invoicing customers on a monthly, recurring basis and managing the services of the customer. We no longer market DuoSubscribe. Instead, we plan to commercially market CloudCharge, our enhanced SaaS solution beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Currently the Beta version of CloudCharge is available.

CloudCharge offers a range of features that would help organizations improve their operations and maximize their revenues. CloudCharge’s key features are:
 

● | customer profiling and portfolio management; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | order taking and provisioning; 
● | invoicing and payment processing; 
● | subscription management and billing; 
● | social media integration; 
● | marketing campaign and sales lead management; 
● | payment gateway integration; 
● | notifications and payment reminders; 
● | easy to use interface; and 
● | open application program interface (“API”) for third party integration. 

 
CloudCharge can also be used for one-time billing by supermarkets, gas stations and other retailers where bills will be generated one time for one or more products and services. CloudCharge also provides tools to manage inventory and multiple stores or sales outlets. CloudCharge is targeted toward small (including sole proprietors) and medium-sized businesses.
 
DigIn
 
DigIn is an end-to-end data visualization and analytics platform that allows the user to analyze structured and unstructured data in one place.
 
DigIn has two business models: cloud-based and on-premise. DigIn supports social media analytics, real time dashboard, data modeling, forecasting, and “what if” analysis, which is a highly valued feature in the present industries. The analysis can be made for several data sources and attributes, such as determining the products that experienced highest sales in a particular season or selling period. This data can be used to predict future sales of the products during specific seasons or time periods. By using social media analytics, a company can analyze its reach in social media and review the comments received about its products, both positive and negative.
 
Our DigIn enterprise version was launched in June 2017, and we expect to market the SaaS version by the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
 
SmoothFlow
 
SmoothFlow is a workflow designing tool that allows the user to create, edit, save and publish workflows, and is similar to Microsoft Workflow Designer, which we previously used to build workflows. If a user needs to build a web-based system, such as an online point of sale, the user can design the processes of the system using SmoothFlow and integrate the process with the interface the user has already designed.
 
SmoothFlow is targeted toward developers who require a workflow designing tool for their development. SmoothFlow’s simple and intuitive drag and drop interface can be used by both new and experienced users with ease. SmoothFlow is expected to launch in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 primarily by integrating with JIRA, an issue tracking and project management tool developed by Atlassian. SmoothFlow is available on the Atlassian marketplace providing access to the users of over 75,000 organizations using Atlassian tools.

New Product Marketing
 
We intend to take our message to as many of the prospective customers as possible by conducting a robust marketing campaign for our new products. Having products that our potential customers would be excited about and willing to pay for, we will pursue a mixed approach of digital and traditional marketing channel to lure customers.
 
We intend to market our new products in various ways and through various channels, including press releases in international online and print media about product development, release dates for new and updated versions of our software and products, new personnel hiring and other news about our company, our achievements and our products.
 
We also intend to advertise via entrepreneur magazines and Gartner publications, and product placement with other leading products. Gartner, Inc., based in Stanford, CT, in the United States, is one of the world’s leading information technology and advisory companies.
 
We also intend to actively market our products via online/social media marketing, such as content marketing via Google and LinkedIn, blogs, forums and video tutorials.
 
We have attended and participated in tradeshows and exhibitions in the past and we intend to participate in the Gartner Business Intelligence & Analytics Summit, and developer conferences, as a sponsor and exhibitor.
 
Duo World will conduct promotional activities jointly with the partners who would be reselling the on premise model of the products and these promotions will be localized based on the country and target market.
 
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
The Company does business with a few major customers. Major customers are defined as those customers whose annual revenue contributions to the Company are greater to or equal to 10% of the Company’s annual revenue. Net sales for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, include sales to the following major customers:

Our Intellectual Property
 
We have no patents. Our trademarks are registered in Sri Lanka and will be registered in the United States shortly. Our trade secrets, copyrights and our other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and we generally control access to and distribution of proprietary information. These agreements generally provide that any confidential information developed by us or on our behalf be kept confidential. Further, we require all employees to execute written agreements assigning to us all rights in all inventions, developments, technologies and other intellectual property created by our employees.
 
There are events that are outside of our control that pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our services are made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our propriety rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming.
 
Employees
 
The Company currently has approximately seventy (70) employees. We have employment agreements with our employees, and our officers. We do not anticipate any of our employees being union members.
Legal Proceedings 
 
We are not involved in any legal proceedings.
 
Competitive Conditions 
 
The subscription management and billing and customer lifecycle management businesses are intensely competitive. We have numerous competitors in the United States and abroad, many of whom have greater financial and human resources than we have. If we are unable to compete effectively and efficiently with our competitors, then we may not generate sufficient revenues and profits to stay in business, in which case investors in our common stock could lose part or all of their investments in the Company.
Business and Legal Developments Regarding Climate Change
 
We do not believe our business will be affected by business and legal developments regarding climate change.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 or “JOBS Act.” We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) March 31, 2022 (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, (3) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the prior three-year period.

11
--

 

As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of reduced or “scaled” disclosure requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These reduced or scaled disclosure requirements include, but are not limited to:
 

1. | being permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report; 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | being able to take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | being exempt from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Annual Report and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in our future filings with the SEC. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have irrevocably elected to not avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
Compliance after Termination of Emerging Growth Company Status
 
After our emerging growth company status is terminated, we will not be able to take advantage of the reduced or scaled disclosure requirements described in subparagraphs 1. and 4., above. However, in the event we are a “smaller reporting company,” as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, after our emerging growth company status has terminated, we will still be able to take advantage of the reduced or scaled disclosure requirements described in subparagraphs 2. and 3., above, for as long as we continue to have smaller reporting company status.
