Please refer to the discussion in NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES under Item 8 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our organization structure and operating subsidiaries.
 
Industry Overview
 
Supported by the Chinese government’s endorsement and driven by its focus on petroleum resource independence, environmental protection and the “Made in China 2025” industrial upgrade, the electric vehicle sector is the most promising segment in the Chinese auto industry. China has become the largest new energy vehicle market in the world. According to a government forecast, China’s new energy vehicle sales are projected to grow to 2.1 million units in 2020, and its penetration is expected to reach 7% by 2020.
 
The fast growth of the electric vehicle sector in China is supported by the Chinese government’s policies. The Chinese government endorses new energy vehicle long-term development. The electric vehicle boom was initiated by government efforts; including tax deductions and subsidies. China is the largest producer of and market for new-energy vehicles. There are over a million new-energy vehicles on China’s roads, or half the world’s total, and we expect China will soon become a global leader in the new energy vehicle sector.
 
Competitive Landscape
 
In general, our EV business faces the competition from two groups of competitors: one is the competition with traditional vehicle manufacturers and the other is the competition against other EV manufacturers.
 
In terms of the competition with the conventional fuel vehicle manufacturers, many of them are much larger in terms of size, having greater manufacturing capabilities, customer bases and financial, marketing and human resources than we do. However, the conventional fuel automobiles face many challenges, including but not limited to environmental pollution and energy scarcity, which provide great opportunities for the rapid development of EV industry in China. With the government’s strong support and various policy incentives, the electric vehicle industry in China has great potential for growth in the future. We believe our exclusive focus on pure electric vehicles products and parts are the basis on which we can compete in the Chinese automotive market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition.
 
There are many companies in China that engage in the research, production and distribution of electric vehicles. Competitions within the electric vehicle market is intensive as we have to compete with many domestic and global, established and new EV manufactures nationwide, some of which have greater brand recognition and resources than we do. As one of the front runners in the Chinese electric vehicle industry, we believe our innovative business model, deep industry knowledge; technological innovation, competitive pricing, and service options allow us to develop the best suitable products and solutions for our targeted customers in our niche market. In particular, the innovative MPT program that we have been advocating for years has been well received by our customers and praised by the Chinese government, which helps us to gain additional market share and compete effectively against other EV manufacturers.

Our Opportunities and Growth Strategy
 
Local governments in China are pushing for new electric vehicle adoption with strong policy support, due to worsening air pollution and concerns about petroleum resource independence. Benefiting from the new energy vehicle industry take-off, Kandi has become one of the front runners in China’s electric vehicle industry, given its technology innovation with integrated solutions and operation experience.
 
Our business strategy includes efforts to provide customers with high-quality products, to expand our footprint in new and existing markets, and to advance our profile and the market demand through the further innovations in the Service Company’s MPT Project and the JV Company’s direct sales channel. To further these initiatives, we are working with our business partners to build an innovative system of public EV sharing stations to provide energy-efficient, convenient travel options for local citizens and tourists. We also provide EV products to end users through our distributors. We anticipate that our pure EV product business in China, through the operations of the JV Company and with the support of new Chinese subsidy policies, will continue to develop and grow in the future.
 
Today, cities in China face four critical challenges in the traffic environment, including pollution, traffic congestion, insufficient parking availability, and growing scarcity of energy supplies, which are mainly the result of ever growing volume of gas-powered private cars. The best solution to solve these problems is to increase more affordable public transportation for urban residents. Currently, subway and bus are the most popular public transportation options available. Subway and bus form the main artery of urban public transportation but such system is lack of capillary. In this regard, we introduced the car-share program by using pure electric vehicles, which is called “Micro Public Transportation” (“MPT”) program. Urban public transportation system can be improved with the MPT program,
 
Since its inception, the MPT program has made impressive progress. As of the end of 2017, the MPT program had been launched in more than 30 cities, including many first-tier, second-tier, third-tier and fourth-tier cities in China such as Hangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Changsha, Kunming, Tianjin, Chongqing, Haikou, Shenzhen, etc.
 
In order to further improve the urban MPT program, based on the learning and experiences in the past years, we introduced a new timeshare car-share brand “QuanTianHou” (Car Share 24/7) in early 2017. As one of the most active practitioners of sharing economy model in today’s China, this innovative business model provides a total solution to EV sharing and can be characterized by “Six No”: no service station, no driving worry, no charging facility, no staff attended, no place restricted, and no environment pollution. No service station: users can pick up, use and return vehicles in any parking spot, which breaks the shackles of the difficulties of building stations in the past and the inconvenience of locating sites by users. No driving worry: platform remotely monitors battery usage of each vehicle and takes initiatives of battery exchange to low-power vehicles to ensure users have sufficient power and dispel their mileage concerns. No charging facility: by using professional operation truck for mobile battery exchange with added cleaning services to idle vehicles, users are hand free during the process, which enhances user experience. No staff attended: by using internet of vehicles big data platform for smart operation and mobile phone APP interactive operation, lease and return vehicles are conducted in entire self-service mode. No place restricted: we will put in large-scale vehicles in a place to achieve full coverage without dead ends. No environment pollution: by adopting a unified low battery constant temperature slowly charging technology, the use life of battery can be effectively increased to achieve true green energy saving. In addition, combined with the formation of “ground help little brother” team, we provide shuttle bus and vehicle scheduling services to achieve service extension to car-share industry chain. From vehicle delivery, self-service use, mobile battery exchange, to vehicle scheduling, QuanTianHou model achieves a perfect closed-loop of all aspects of car-share. We have reason to believe that this reinventing business model advocated by Kandi and practiced by the Service Company will become the benchmark of urban car-share and play a significant role in the development of China’s urban travel ecosphere.

To the knowledge of the management, Kandi’s products comply with applicable emission standards and regulations in China, the United States, Europe and Canada. However, in the event any of our current standards and regulations are amended or interpreted differently in the future, we cannot evaluate the impact on our business such changes may bring.
 
Product Safety and Regulation
 
Safety Regulation
 
The U.S. federal government and individual states have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations relating to the use and safety of Kandi’s products. The federal government is the primary regulator of product safety. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to ATVs and off-road vehicles. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to off-road vehicles.
 
In August 2008, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (the “Product Safety Act”) was passed. The Product Safety Act requires all manufacturers and distributors who import into or distribute ATVs within the United States to comply with the American National Standards Institute/Specialty Vehicle Institute of America (“ANSI/SVIA”) safety standard, which previously had been voluntary. The Product Safety Act also requires the same manufacturers and distributors to have ATV action plans filed with the CPSC that are substantially similar to the voluntary action plans that were previously in effect. Kandi currently complies with the ANSI/SVIA standard.
 
Kandi’s off-road vehicles are subject to federal vehicle safety standards administered by NHTSA. Kandi’s off-road vehicles are also subject to various state vehicle safety standards. Kandi believes that its off-road vehicles comply with safety standards applicable to off-road vehicles.
