To complete the acquisition, the Company must incur expenditures of not less than USD$50,000 on or before June 1, 2017, and not less than USD$225,000 on or before July 12, 2018. Thereafter the claims will be subject to a royalty equal to two percent (2%) Net Smelter Return (NSR) for as long as the Company holds any interest in the claims, subject to a right to repurchase a 1% NSR for $1,250,000 at any time up to when a production decision is made.
 
Our Current Business
 
iWeedz.com
 
On November 29, 2016 we issued a news release announcing our intention to relaunch our proprietary iWeedz.com search engine and e-commerce platform which was originally launched in February 2014.  The iWeedz.com search engine is a cannabis information resource that connects consumers with vendors or likeminded individuals. iWeedz.com for vendors will be a cloud based solution to manage inventory, post daily deals, attract new customer with proximity marketing via mobile phones, engage with customers via email & text messaging and offer payment processing. We intend to operate this technology platform through a relaunched Website located at www.iWeedz.com, and through mobile application for Apple iPhone operating system (iOS) and Android operating systems. As of the date of this report, our website is not fully functional and our application for Apple iOS and Android operating systems has not been released.

Our decision to revitalize the iWeedz platform comes at a time when several U.S. States have legalized and regulated, or are in the process of legalizing and regulating, medical marijuana.  The states of Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington have also legalized marijuana for recreational use.  Additionally, the Government of Canada has been engaged in an ongoing process of regulating medical marijuana, and is expected to introduce legislation for the legalization of recreational marijuana in the spring of 2017.
 
iWeedz will generate revenue by charging member cannabis vendors a monthly fee and by selling banner space on its website and application to these vendors. The banners will be viewable by iWeedz consumer members who are within the vendor’s geographic location and who indicate an interest in the vendor or its products, based on the member’s profile or specific user information gathered by the iWeedz technology.  We believe iWeedz’s targeted market intelligence will allow us to charge a premium for ad space. As of the date of this report, we have not yet determined the cost to our vendors for banner space.
 
Target Market
 
Our target market includes both businesses and consumers in the local marijuana industry. iWeedz is intended for all types of cannabis consumers including those new to cannabis, medical marijuana patients, or recreational consumers, if recreational use is legally permitted in the consumer’s state of residence. iWeedz also targets both medicinal and recreational dispensaries, depending on whether the specific geographical location legally permits recreational marijuana use.
 
Our target market further includes consumers who are frequent users of the internet, mobile phones and other mobile devices to locate retailers, conduct online research and act on promotions such as daily deals, coupons or discounts.
 
 Our Mineral Exploration Business
 
Our mineral exploration strategy is focused on the acquisition, and development of Cobalt, nickel, and lithium resources properties to capitalize on the growing energy storage (battery) market associated with the popularization of electric vehicles.
 
 On February 24, 2017, we entered into an Option/Purchase Agreement dated February 23, 2017 (the “Agreement”) with Diamond Hunter Ltd. (the “Optionor”) pursuant to which we acquired an exclusive option to purchase a 100% interest in the Gochagar Lake Nickel-Copper-Cobalt project claims.

Thereafter the claims will be subject to a royalty equal to two percent (2%) Net Smelter Return (NSR) for as long as the Company holds any interest in the claims, subject to a right to repurchase a 1% NSR for $1,250,000 at any time up to when a production decision is made.
 
The Gochagar Lake Nickel-Copper-Cobalt Project
 
The Gochagar Lake project, consists of four claims covering 3,759 hectares and is located in northern Saskatchewan approximately 75 km north of the town of La Ronge.  The claims include the following tenures:

Tenure No. | Hectares | Expiry/Renewal Date
-----------+----------+--------------------
S-110897 | 229 | 9/12/2018 
S-110898 | 2,702 | 9/12/2018

Historical exploration has identified semi-massive and massive Ni-Cu deposits with significantly elevated levels of Cobalt, a vital component in the manufacture of the latest generation of lithium ion batteries.  The terms “semi-massive” and “massive” do not refer to size, but rather refer to mineral deposits associated with or created by the warming of subsurface water by volcanic events.

Background and Technical Summary
 
Nickel-copper-cobalt sulphide mineralization was discovered at Gochagar Lake, located in the La Ronge meta-volcanic belt, in the mid-1960s with subsequent exploration carried out mainly by the Scurry-Rainbow Oil Company Limited.  Exploration activities included soil sampling, trenching of gossans, geophysical surveys and diamond drilling.  A total of 85 mostly vertical drill holes (total of 27,400 m) delineated the mineralized Gochagar A-Zone (or Main Zone) with a strike length of 330 meters, widths of up to 120 meters, and depths of up to 305 meters. The Gochagar A-Zone mineralization consists of disseminated mm-cm size blebs of sulphide, net-textured sulphide and, in places, semi-massive to massive sulphide pods. Assay grades of up to 3.1% Ni, 0.28% Cu, and 0.22% Co were reported.  Saskatchewan government records (Mineral Property # 0880) reported assay values as high as 3.92%Ni, 0.70% Cu and 2.86% Co.
 
Examination of the available geological and geophysical data, plus first-hand experience on the property by a senior Ni-Cu-PGE consultant, indicates the property has some very positive exploration attributes not previously recognized.  These include:
 
 
1. | The semi-massive and massive sulphide concentrations in the Gochagar mineralized zone have high Ni/Cu ratios (>10), and Pd/Ir ratios (6-11). Since 1980, it has been speculated that komatiitic nickel sulphide mineralization and potential ores should exist in the central La Ronge meta-volcanic belt because of the recognition of komatiite lavas in the belt.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Research has clearly demonstrated that the komatiitic composition of the massive sulphides in the Gochagar Lake deposit are not compatible with the host rock and rock forming mineral compositions that the sulphides reside in. This suggests that these high grade Ni-Cu-Co sulphides were introduced through an interconnected mineralized plumbing system that was tapping into a much more primitive mineralized komatiitic system at depth or proximal to the main deposit. This is further corroborated by discoveries in the Gochagar Lake area of discrete high grade massive Ni-Cu-Co sulphides in the surrounding country rock. These sulphides are devoid of any mafic or ultramafic rock material like that hosting the Gochagar Lake deposit. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | The Gochagar Lake area and deposit sit on the boundary between the Rottenstone Domain and the La Ronge Domain. It is well known that structural boundaries between two major geological terranes are an excellent geological environment for the formation of Ni-Cu deposits.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | The area is extensively covered with glacial debris and muskeg, so surface geological prospecting should not reveal any new gossans or outcrop showings, as was the case in the early exploration of the 1960’s. However, a 2,284 km deep penetrating state of the art airborne electromagnetic and magnetic survey (VTEM) was flown in June 2008 and identified numerous potential targets that have yet to be investigated.

Exploration Plan
 
US Lithium’s initial work plan will involve a digital compilation of all available data into a comprehensive data base, reprocessing of all geophysical data and a complete reinterpretation of the geology.  A new 3-D model will be generated which will allow the Company to better visualize the deposit’s potential size and geometry and prepare its Phase 2 drilling plan.
Elon Claims, Esmeralda County Nevada
 
 On April 25, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with Rangefront whereby Rangefront granted us the option to acquire 100% of the title, interest and right in and to four mineral claims, known as the Elon claims, located in Esmerelda County, NevadaIn exchange for the grant of the Option by Rangefront, we paid $3,500 to Rangefront on signing of the agreement and issued an aggregate of 200,000 restricted common shares of our company to Brian Goss as the authorized representative of Rangefront.  
 
The Elon claim block consists of four 20-acre placer claims and is located in Esmerelda County, Nevada. Clayton Valley is home to the only mine producing lithium from brine in North America. As at the date of this report, we have not conducted any exploration on the Elon Claims. On August 25, 2016, we renewed the Elon claims until September 1, 2017. We plan to maintain the claims for the foreseeable future but have no plans to conduct exploration on the property during fiscal 2017.

Competition
 
The mining industry is intensely competitive. We aim to compete with numerous individuals and companies, including many major mining companies, which have substantially greater technical, financial and operational resources and staffs. Accordingly, there is a high degree of competition for access to investment funds to support acquisition, exploration and development. There are other competitors that have operations in the areas in which our properties are located, and the presence of these competitors could adversely affect our ability to compete for financing and obtain the service providers, staff or equipment necessary for the exploration and exploitation of our properties.
Compliance with Government Regulation
 
Regulation related to iWeedz.com
 
We are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future regulations and laws could impede the growth of the Internet or other online services. These regulations and laws may involve taxation, tariffs, subscriber privacy, anti-spam, data protection, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, the provision of online payment services and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet or e-commerce. In addition, it is possible that government entities or public interest groups may seek to censor content available on our website and application or may even attempt to completely block our emails or access to our websites. Adverse legal or regulatory developments could substantially harm our business. In particular, in the event that we are restricted, in whole or in part, from operating in certain locations, our ability to increase our customer base may be adversely affected. Currently, we believe we are in compliance with such government regulations and laws.
 
Additionally, a variety of federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. The existing privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. In addition, various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws regarding privacy matters. For example, recently there have been Congressional hearings and increased attention to the capture and use of location-based information relating to users of smartphones and other mobile devices. We intend to post privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of member data on our website and application. Several Internet companies have incurred substantial penalties for failing to abide by the representations made in their privacy policies and practices. In addition, several states have adopted legislation that requires businesses to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect sensitive personal information and to provide notice to consumers in the event of a security breach. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related consent orders, Federal Trade Commission requirements or orders or other federal or state privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles, could result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, a failure or perceived failure to comply with industry standards or with our own privacy policies and practices could result in a loss of consumer members or vendors and adversely affect our business. Federal and state governmental authorities also continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the use of third party web “cookies” for behavioral advertising. The regulation of these “cookies” and other current online advertising practices could adversely affect our business.
 
Marijuana Regulation
 
At least 24 States in the USA, and the federal government of Canada have passed some form of legislation related to the permission to grow, cultivate, sell or use marijuana either for medical purposes or for recreational or “adult use” purposes; or both. The various state legislation is not necessarily harmonious with one another, leading to potential conflicts between state laws. It is most often not legal to transport cannabis-related products across state lines and national borders.
  7
 
 

We do not intend to directly hold, handle, or distribute any marijuana products in any location within or outside of the USA. We intend to comply with federal law that provides for certain exemptions for agricultural (industrial) hemp and certain byproducts to be manufactured and sold in the US. Our technology may have applications within the legal marijuana sector and we may seek to license that technology to companies that have met and comply with state regulations for the sale or distribution of cannabis related products in any particular jurisdiction.
 
Mineral Exploration
 
Any operations at our mineral exploration properties will be subject to various federal, state, or provincial laws and regulations in the US or Canada which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We will be required to obtain those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct exploration and other programs. There are no current orders or directions relating to us or to our lithium properties with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. Such compliance may include feasibility studies on the surface impact of our proposed operations, costs associated with minimizing surface impact, water treatment and protection, reclamation activities, including rehabilitation of various sites, on-going efforts at alleviating the mining impact on wildlife and permits or bonds as may be required to ensure our compliance with applicable regulations. It is possible that the costs and delays associated with such compliance could become so prohibitive that we may decide to not proceed with exploration, development, or mining operations on any of our mineral properties. We are not presently aware of any specific material environmental constraints affecting our properties that would preclude the economic development or operation of our optioned property.
Environmental Regulations
 
We are not aware of any material violations of environmental permits, licenses or approvals that have been issued with respect to our operations. We expect to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to our business, and at this time, we do not anticipate incurring any material capital expenditures to comply with any environmental regulations or other requirements.
 
While our intended projects and business activities do not currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
Research and Development
 
We have not incurred any research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our company acquired an exclusive license to use certain patents, technical information and trademarks for a term of 500 years, pursuant to the license agreement with Windward dated March 12, 2014, including the domain names www.iWeeds.com, www.iWeedz.com and the platform that powers iWeeds.com.
