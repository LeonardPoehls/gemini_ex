Overview of Corporate History
 
ABV Consulting, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “ABVN” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on October 15, 2013. At formation, the Company authorized 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. In connection with our formation, the Company’s founder, Andrew Gavrin, received 5,000,000 shares of common stock as founder shares, and Mr. Gavrin served as the Company’s chief executive officer, chief financial officer and sole director from the time of incorporation until August 22, 2016. 
 
In June 2014, we completed a Regulation D Rule 506 offering in which we sold 533,000 shares of common stock to 34 investors, at a price per share of $0.10 per share for an aggregate offering price of $53,300. On December 23, 2014, our Registration Statement on Form S-1 became effective, under which the investors referenced in the preceding sentence were able to sell their shares of common stock. 
 
On August 22, 2016, in connection with the sale of a controlling interest in the Company, Mr. Gavrin sold to Ms. Ping Zhang the entire amount of his 5,000,000 shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $228,400 (the “Change of Control Transaction”). In connection with the Change of Control Transaction, Mr. Gavrin agreed pay $25,186.25 of debts of the Company in addition to the cancellation of $35,000 worth of debt owed to him by the Company. Concurrent with the Change of Control Transaction, Mr. Gavrin resigned from all corporate officer and director roles, and was replaced in all roles by Mr. Wai Lim Wong. 
 
On December 19, 2016, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of the Company’s common stock from 100,000,000 to 3,000,000,000 shares, par value $0.0001. We effected this amendment for the purposes of providing sufficient capital stock to use as consideration for our business strategy explained below in this Item 1, and for other reasons. 
 
Because the business of the Company changed materially following the Change of Control Transaction, this Item 1 will include a brief summary of the Company’s business prior to the Change of Control Transaction and will focus primarily on the business of the Company following the Change of Control Transaction. 
 
Summary of Business Prior to the Change of Control Transaction
 
The Company was originally formed to engage in merchandising and consulting services to craft beer brewers and distributors, as well as providing additional branding and marketing support within the craft beer industry to retailers and other organizations. The Company’s customer base consisted of alcohol beverage manufacturers, distributors, retailers, beer festival operators and other organizations involved in the sale and marketing of craft beer. 
 
We focused our early efforts on pro bono engagements and secured one paid engagement for $2,000 by the close of our second quarter in 2016.

Overview of Current Business
 
Following the Change of Control Transaction, our new management decided to pursue a strategic acquisition strategy focused on acquisition target companies with operations located primarily in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, the People’s Republic of China (including Hong Kong and Macau) (the “PRC”), Taiwan and other jurisdictions within Asia. In connection with this new strategy, we moved our corporate headquarters from Pennsylvania to Hong Kong. We believe that the PRC’s “One Belt, One Road” (“OBOR”) regional cooperation initiative will be a significant driver for strategic investment opportunities throughout Asia. 
“One Belt, One Road”
 
Between September and October 2013, the PRC government disclosed its plan to pursue a regional trade, investment, infrastructure and cultural exchange program incorporating approximately sixty countries located along the historic silk road trading route connecting Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Central and East Asia—called the “Silk Road Economic Belt”—and also nations located in the South China Sea, the South Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean—called the “Maritime Silk Road.” The initiative has since been labeled “One Belt, One Road” or “OBOR” for short, and in 2014 the Chinese foreign minister identified OBOR as the single most important feature of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s foreign policy.
 
The PRC government intends to invest at least $4 trillion over an indefinite time period on projects located within OBOR constituent countries, and hundreds of projects worth approximately $1 trillion have been approved to date. 
 
OBOR-Related Investment Opportunities 
 
We anticipate that entities based in Hong Kong will continue their historic gatekeeping function as financial and advisory intermediaries between the PRC and the world at large, and Asia in particular. We intend to avail ourselves of this strategic advantage to pursue strategic co-investments with entities deploying OBOR-related funds and to invest into companies and assets that are well positioned to benefit from OBOR-related investments. 
Objectives and Strategies
 
We explored a number of strategic investment opportunities following the Change of Control Transaction, but we did not enter into any definitive agreements by the end of FY2016. See our Current Report on Form 8-K, dated March 2, 2017, for a description of our recent acquisition of Allied Plus (Samoa) Limited (“APSL”), which closed on February 28, 2017. APSL is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 
 
In pursuing our acquisition strategy, we are guided by our core objective of maximizing stockholder value by sourcing and acquiring assets with stable cash flow and/or significant growth potential connected to OBOR-related investment and trade and our ability to assist the investment target with securing economic and financial resources. 
 
Allied Plus (Samoa) Limited
 
APSL primarily engages in the business of providing services to agents and financial advisers in Southeast Asia. The management of APSL possesses certain knowledge of investment criteria of OBOR-related investment entities, and provides consulting services to regional consultants and brokers with regard to their efforts to source and promote attractive investment opportunities.

Marketing and Sales Efforts, Pricing
 
We engage in no marketing or sales efforts. APSL secures clients primarily on a word-of-mouth basis, due to its management’s reputation for having a broad network and industry-specific knowledge base which appeals to regional consultants and brokers. 
 
APSL charges regional consultants and brokers a flat fee over a contract period of 90 days, after which the contract expires. We have not identified any specific customers of APSL on which we rely to a material degree for the continued business of APSL. 
 
As of the date hereof, we intend to continue with APSL’s current line of business, and we will consider providing other kinds of services and generating revenues from other activities. 
 
Governmental Approvals and Environmental Laws
 
As a service company, APSL does not produce or sell any products, and apart from regular business licenses in the jurisdiction in which we operate, the Company is not currently subject to material governmental approvals or environmental regulations. 
Competition
 
We face substantial competition from individuals and entities that seek to invest into Asia. Although we feel that the personal relationships developed by our management and business partners provide us with a competitive advantage in sourcing, analyzing, and approving optimal deals, we compete with corporate strategic investors, financial investors like private equity funds, wealth management offices, high net worth individuals and ultra high net worth individuals, sovereign wealth funds, and any entities which engage in investment activities in Asia. Our management and the management of APSL compete primarily on the basis of reputation for honest and thoughtful business practices, as well as quality of network and strategic relationships. 
Intellectual Property and Other Contracts
 
We currently do not have any patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements, or labor contracts. 
 
Employees 
 
We have two paid full-time employees who provide services on an at-will basis.
