ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
We are a fully-integrated, biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of transformative and well-tolerated targeted small molecule drugs to treat patients afflicted with cancer and other high-burden diseases. We market in the United States BRAFTOVITM (encorafenib) capsules in combination with MEKTOVI® (binimetinib) tablets for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutation. Our lead clinical programs, encorafenib and binimetinib, are being investigated in over 30 clinical trials across a number of solid tumor indications, including a Phase 3 trial in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC). Our pipeline includes several additional programs being advanced by us or current license-holders, including selumetinib (partnered with AstraZeneca), larotrectinib (partnered with Loxo Oncology), ipatasertib (partnered with Genentech), tucatinib (partnered with Seattle Genetics) and ARRY-797 (being developed by Yarra Therapeutics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Array), all of which are currently in registration trials. Ganovo® (danoprevir, partnered with Roche and licensed by Roche to Ascletis Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. in China) was recently approved in China for the treatment of viral hepatitis C.

BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI
On June 27, 2018, the FDA approved BRAFTOVI capsules in combination with MEKTOVI tablets for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. BRAFTOVI is not indicated for the treatment of patients with wild-type BRAF melanoma.
BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI were available for sale beginning on July 2, 2018, and patients began receiving the combination therapy that same week. 
We have exclusive rights to BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI in the U.S. and Canada. Array has granted Ono Pharmaceutical exclusive rights to commercialize both products in Japan and South Korea, Medison exclusive rights to commercialize both products in Israel and Pierre Fabre exclusive rights to commercialize both products in all other countries, including those in Europe, Asia and Latin America.
BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI are not approved outside of the U.S. The European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Swiss Medicines Agency (Swissmedic) and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) are currently reviewing Marketing Authorization Applications submitted by Pierre Fabre. On July 27, 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA adopted a positive opinion recommending approval of BRAFTOVI in combination with MEKTOVI for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAFV600 mutation. This recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission (EC), which has the authority to approve medicines for the European Union (EU). The final EC decision, expected by the end of September 2018, will be applicable to all 28 EU member states, as well as Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway. Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency has accepted the Manufacturing and Marketing Approval applications submitted by Ono Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd. 
The U.S. and international regulatory submissions were based on findings from the pivotal Phase 3 COLUMBUS trial. 
On July 16, 2018, Array submitted supplementary New Drug Applications (sNDA) to seek inclusion of overall survival (OS) data from the Phase 3 COLUMBUS trial in the BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI labels.
Also, on July 13, 2018, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) updated the Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Melanoma to include BRAFTOVI in combination with MEKTOVI as a Category 1 first-line and second-line treatment option for patients with BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K-mutant metastatic or unresectable melanoma. A Category 1 recommendation indicates that, based upon high-level evidence, there is uniform NCCN consensus that the intervention is appropriate.
Encorafenib and Binimetinib 
On March 2, 2015 (the "Effective Date"), we regained development and commercialization rights to binimetinib under the Termination and Asset Transfer Agreement with Novartis Pharma AG and Novartis Pharmaceutical Ltd. and to encorafenib under the Asset Transfer Agreement with Novartis Pharma AG (which we collectively refer to as the “Novartis Agreements”). Along with global ownership of both assets, the Novartis Agreements transferred to Array a low single digit royalty obligation payable based on net sales of encorafenib and we received an upfront payment of $85.0 million from Novartis. We believe these programs present significant opportunity to us in the area of oncology. 
Novartis continues to fund ongoing trials with encorafenib and binimetinib that were active or planned as of the close of the Novartis Agreements in 2015.  As of June 30, 2018, the level of spend associated with these studies continues to decrease as the studies progress through their later life cycle. As patients have continued to receive treatment under certain trials for longer than initially anticipated, we may hit certain reimbursement limits for select trials, including the COLUMBUS Phase 3 trial. Reimbursement revenue from Novartis was approximately $81.0 million for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018.

PIERRE FABRE AGREEMENT
We entered into a Development and Commercialization Agreement ("the PF Agreement") with Pierre Fabre in 2015 pursuant to which we granted Pierre Fabre rights to commercialize encorafenib and binimetinib in all countries except for the United States, Canada, Japan, Korea and Israel. The PF Agreement satisfied our commitment to secure a development and commercialization partner for the European market for both encorafenib and binimetinib acceptable to European Commission regulatory agencies made in connection with the Novartis Agreements.
The PF Agreement closed in December 2015. All clinical trials involving encorafenib and binimetinib that were ongoing or planned at the Effective Date, including the COLUMBUS trial and other then active Novartis sponsored and investigator sponsored clinical studies, continue to be conducted pursuant to the terms of the Novartis Agreements. Additional worldwide development activities of encorafenib and binimetinib will be governed by a Global Development Plan (GDP) with Pierre Fabre. Pierre Fabre and Array jointly fund worldwide development costs under the GDP, with Array covering 60% and Pierre Fabre covering 40% of such costs. The initial GDP includes multiple trials, including the BEACON CRC trial, we and Pierre Fabre have agreed to commit at least €100 million in combined funds for these studies in colorectal cancer (CRC) and melanoma.
Pierre Fabre is responsible for seeking regulatory and pricing and reimbursement approvals in the European Economic Area and its other licensed territories. We have also entered into a Clinical Supply Agreement and a Commercial Supply Agreement with Pierre Fabre pursuant to which we will supply or procure the supply of clinical and commercial supplies of drug substance and drug product for Pierre Fabre, the costs of which will be borne by Pierre Fabre. We have also agreed to cooperate with Pierre Fabre to ensure the supply of companion diagnostics for use with encorafenib and binimetinib in indications as needed.
Each party has agreed not to distribute, sell or promote competing products in each party’s respective markets during a period of exclusivity. Each party has also agreed to indemnify the other party from certain liabilities specified in the Agreement.
In connection with the PF Agreement, we received $30.0 million as a non-refundable up-front payment during the year ended June 30, 2016. The PF Agreement contains substantive potential milestone payments of up to $25.0 million for achievement of two regulatory milestones relating to European Commission marketing approvals for two specified indications and of up to $390.0 million for achievement of seven commercialization milestones if certain net sales amounts are achieved for any licensed indications. We are also entitled to double-digit royalties based on net sales under the agreement.
ONO AGREEMENT
Effective May 31, 2017, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement (the “Ono Agreement”) with Ono, a company duly organized and existing under the laws of Japan, pursuant to which we granted Ono exclusive rights to commercialize encorafenib and binimetinib in Japan and the Republic of Korea (the “Ono Territory”), along with the right to develop these products in the Ono Territory. We retain all rights outside the Ono Territory as well as the right to conduct development and manufacturing activities in the Ono Territory, except for rights we have granted to Pierre Fabre under the PF Agreement. 

Under the terms of the Ono Agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront cash payment of ¥3.5 billion, or $31.2 million. We are entitled to receive potential milestone payments of up to ¥900.0 million for the achievement of two remaining development milestones, ¥5.0 billion for the achievement of eight regulatory milestones and ¥10.5 billion for the achievement of five commercialization milestones if certain annual net sales targets are achieved. A portion of these milestones is related to the advancement the Phase 3 BEACON CRC trial in the Ono Territory. We are further eligible for tiered double-digit royalties on annual net sales of encorafenib and binimetinib in the Ono Territory, starting at 22% for annual net sales under ¥10.0 billion and increasing to 25% for annual net sales in excess of ¥10.0 billion subject to certain adjustments. As of June 30, 2018, ¥1.0 billion was the equivalent of approximately $9.0 million.

All ongoing clinical trials involving encorafenib and binimetinib, including the BEACON CRC and COLUMBUS trials, continued as planned as of the effective date of the Ono Agreement, and Ono is entitled to the data derived from such studies. As part of the Ono Agreement, Ono obtained the right to participate in any future global development of encorafenib and binimetinib by contributing 12% of the future costs of such development. Ono is responsible for seeking regulatory and marketing approvals for products in the Ono Territory and for any development of encorafenib and binimetinib specifically necessary to obtain such approvals. We will furnish clinical supplies of drug substance to 
7

Ono for use in Ono’s development efforts, and Ono may elect to have us provide commercial supplies of drug product to Ono pursuant to a commercial supply agreement to be entered into by us and Ono, in each case the costs of which will be borne by Ono. We have also agreed to discuss and agree with Ono on a strategy to ensure the supply of companion diagnostics to Ono for use with encorafenib and binimetinib in certain indications in the Ono Territory. Each party has agreed not to distribute, sell or promote competing MEK or RAF products in the Ono Territory during the term of the Ono Agreement.
The Ono Agreement will continue in effect on a product-by-product, country-by-country basis for a period that expires ten years after the later of expiration of patent protection or marketing exclusivity for the applicable product. The Ono Agreement may be terminated by either party for breach of the Agreement by the other party, in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party, by Ono with 180 days’ prior notice after the fifth year after first commercial sale of either binimetinib or encorafenib in the Ono Territory, or by Ono on a product-by-product basis for certain safety reasons.

COLUMBUS PHASE 3 TRIAL
The COLUMBUS trial is a two-part, international, randomized, open label Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib compared to vemurafenib and encorafenib monotherapy in 921 patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAFV600 mutation. All secondary efficacy analyses, including overall survival, are descriptive in nature. Over 200 sites across North America, Europe, South America, Africa, Asia and Australia participated in the trial. 
COLUMBUS Median Overall Survival Results
On June 4, 2018, we announced updated results from the Phase 3 COLUMBUS trial in BRAF-mutant advanced melanoma as part of an oral presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting. The median overall survival (mOS) was 33.6 months for patients treated with the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib compared to 16.9 months for patients treated with vemurafenib as a monotherapy. The combination reduced the risk of death compared to treatment with vemurafenib alone hazard ratio (HR) of 0.61, [95% CI 0.47, 0.79, p <0.0001]. The data showed limited use of post-trial immunotherapy, which is consistent with other published pivotal trials of BRAF and MEK-inhibitors in BRAF-mutant advanced melanoma.
As previously reported, the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib was generally well-tolerated. Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) that occurred in more than 5% of patients receiving the combination were increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) (9%), increased blood creatine phosphokinase (CK) (7%) and hypertension (6%). Full safety results of COLUMBUS Part 1 were published in The Lancet Oncology.
BEACON CRC PHASE 3 TRIAL
BEACON CRC is a randomized, open-label, global trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of BRAFTOVI, MEKTOVI and cetuximab in patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic CRC whose disease has progressed after one or two prior regimens. BEACON CRC is the first and only Phase 3 trial designed to test a BRAF/MEK combo targeted therapy in BRAF-mutant advanced CRC. Thirty patients were treated in the safety lead-in and received the triplet combination (BRAFTOVI 300 mg daily, MEKTOVI 45 mg twice daily and cetuximab, an anti-EGFR antibody, per label). Of the 30 patients, 29 had a BRAFV600E mutation. MSI-H, resulting from defective DNA mismatch repair, was detected in only one patient. As previously announced, the triplet combination demonstrated good tolerability, supporting initiation of the randomized portion of the trial.
The randomized portion of the BEACON CRC trial is designed to assess the efficacy of BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab with or without MEKTOVI compared to cetuximab and irinotecan-based therapy. Approximately 615 patients are expected to be randomized 1:1:1 to receive triplet combination, doublet combination (BRAFTOVI and cetuximab) or the control arm (irinotecan-based therapy and cetuximab). The primary endpoint of the trial is overall survival of the triplet combination compared to the control arm. Secondary endpoints address efficacy of the doublet combination compared to the control arm, and the triplet combination compared to the doublet therapy. Other secondary endpoints include PFS, ORR, duration of response, safety and tolerability. Health related quality of life data will also be assessed. The trial is being conducted at over 200 investigational sites in North America, South America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. 
8

We are the global sponsor of the trial. Pursuant to the PF Agreement, Pierre Fabre has elected to co-fund 40% of the cost of the BEACON CRC trial. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, is the owner of cetuximab outside the United States and Canada and will supply cetuximab to all trial sites outside the United States and Canada as part of the collaboration. If successful, results would support regulatory submissions for all three parties as well as Ono.
On August 7, 2018, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to BRAFTOVI in combination with MEKTOVI and cetuximab for the treatment of patients with BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic CRC as detected by an FDA-approved test, after failure of one to two prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease. FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation is an FDA process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that they may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.
Based on consultation with the FDA and EMA, we plan to amend the BEACON CRC protocol to allow for an interim analysis of trial endpoints. Should a planned analysis based primarily on confirmed overall response rate (ORR) and durability of response be supportive, we plan to use it to seek accelerated approval in the U.S. The interim analysis may also support regulatory submissions in other regions. The Company anticipates topline results from this analysis in the first half of 2019. This timing allows for the subset of patients required for the interim analysis of ORR to achieve an objective response and for the durability of responses to be appropriately evaluated.
The BEACON CRC trial continues to enroll well. Based on the updated data presented at the 20th World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer (ESMO World GI), excitement among global investigators continues to increase. As a result of recent FDA approval for BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI in BRAF-mutant melanoma, we have made the decision to conclude U.S.-specific patient enrollment in the BEACON CRC trial. This action was based on the recommendation of the trial Steering Committee and we expect this will help to avoid introducing unwanted informative censoring into the trial, as U.S. patients and investigators now have the potential to access encorafenib and binimetinib via commercial supply. As the number of active global sites has continued to increase since the beginning of the year, we do not believe this decision will have a material impact on our plan to complete enrollment of the trial around the end of 2018.
We announced updated safety and efficacy results, including OS, from the safety lead-in of the BEACON CRC trial evaluating the triplet combination of encorafenib, binimetinib and cetuximab, in 29 patients with BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic CRC during an oral presentation at ESMO World GI on June 23, 2018. At the time of analysis, the OS data were fully mature through 12.6 months and the median OS had not yet been reached. The observed one-year OS rate for this cohort was 62%. The mPFS for patients treated with the triplet was 8 months [95% CI 5.6-9.3] and is similar between patients receiving one prior line of therapy and patients receiving two prior lines of therapy. The triple combination was generally well-tolerated with no unexpected toxicities. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events seen in at least 10% of patients were fatigue (13%), anemia (10%), increased blood creatine kinase (10%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (10%).
IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY COLLABORATIONS WITH BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB, MERCK AND PFIZER
We are also developing binimetinib in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors and previously announced separate, strategic collaborations with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck and Pfizer. Each collaboration is pursuing a different rationally designed clinical approach. 
BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COLLABORATION
The clinical trial continues to advance and is designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of binimetinib in combination with nivolumab (anti-PD-1 therapy), with and without ipilimumab (CTLA-4 antibody), in patients with advanced metastatic microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC and the presence of a RAS mutation who have received one or two prior regimens. The trial is jointly supported by us and Bristol-Myers Squibb and sponsored by us.
MERCK COLLABORATION
The clinical trial continues to advance and is designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of binimetinib in combination with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 therapy), with and without FOLFOX or FOLFIRI (chemotherapy), in first or second-line patients with CRC whose tumors are not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). The trial is sponsored and funded by Merck, with us providing binimetinib supply.
9

PFIZER COLLABORATION
The clinical trial is designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of several novel anti-cancer combinations, including binimetinib, avelumab (anti-PD-L1 therapy), and talazoparib (PARP inhibitor) across various tumor types and is expected to begin during the third calendar quarter of 2018. Initially, the focus will be in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer, with additional indications being explored at a later stage. The trial will be sponsored and funded by Pfizer, with us providing binimetinib supply.
ARRY-382
ARRY-382 is a wholly-owned, highly selective and potent, small molecule inhibitor of CSF1R kinase activity. We are advancing a Phase 2 trial of ARRY-382 in combination with pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 therapy, in patients with advanced solid tumors. The trial includes three cohorts: patients with pancreatic cancer with one prior line of therapy and no prior treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, patients with ovarian cancer who are platinum refractory and no prior treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, and patients with solid tumors who have progressed on prior PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors.
ARRY-797
ARRY-797 is an oral, selective p38 MAPK inhibitor that is currently advancing in a Phase 3 trial in patients with LMNA-related DCM a rare, degenerative cardiovascular disease caused by mutations in the LMNA gene and characterized by poor prognosis.
Preclinical Drug Discovery Programs
We also have a portfolio of proprietary and partnered preclinical drug discovery programs, including collaborations with Loxo Oncology, Mirati Therapeutics, Inc., and other companies.
In October 2014, we initiated an agreement with Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. whereby we conducted a feasibility program for Mirati related to an identified target in exchange for an up-front payment of $1.6 million. In September 2015, Mirati exercised an option to extend the feasibility program for six months, for which we received a $0.8 million option extension fee. During April 2016, Mirati elected to exercise an option to take an exclusive, worldwide license to an active compound under the agreement for which Array received $2.5 million and will receive additional fees as reimbursement for research and development services. In June 2017, we and Mirati entered into a second agreement related to a different target in exchange for an up-front payment of $2.0 million that was received in June 2017. During April 2018, Mirati elected to exercise an option to take an exclusive, worldwide license to an active compound under the second agreement for which we received $2.0 million and will receive additional fees as reimbursement for research and development services. The Mirati Agreements contain substantive potential milestone payments of up to $692.5 million if certain developmental, commercial and net sales amounts are achieved in the United States, the European Union and Japan.
Any information we report about the development plans or the progress or results of clinical trials or other development activities of our partners is based on information that is publicly disclosed.
Our significant clinical stage partners advancing compounds discovered by Array include:

• | Asahi Kasei Pharma – In March 2016, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation ("AKP") to develop and commercialize select Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TRKA) inhibitors, including Array-invented AK-1830 for pain, inflammation and other non-cancer indications. AKP is currently advancing AK-1830 in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with inflammatory disease in Japan.


• | ASLAN – We entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with ASLAN in July 2011 to develop our pan-HER inhibitor, varlitinib. ASLAN is currently advancing varlitinib in registration trials in patients with biliary tract cancer and gastric cancer. In January 2018, we granted ASLAN an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize varlitinib. The License Agreement replaced the 2011 agreement.


• | Seattle Genetics – We entered into a Development and Commercialization Agreement with Cascadian Therapeutics in May 2013, to collaborate on the development and commercialization of tucatinib, an orally active, reversible and selective small-molecule HER2 inhibitor, for the treatment of cancer. In December 2014, we granted Cascadian Therapeutics an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize

10

tucatinib. The License Agreement replaced the 2013 agreement. In March 2018, Seattle Genetics acquired Cascadian Therapeutics and is continuing development of tucatinib in registration trials in patients with metastatic breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases.

• | Genentech – We entered into a worldwide strategic Drug Discovery Collaboration Agreement with Genentech in January 2003, which was expanded in 2005, 2008, and 2009, and is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics. The most advanced drug is ipatasertib, an AKT inhibitor for cancer, which is currently in Phase 3. We also entered into a License Agreement with Genentech in August 2011 for the development of each company's small molecule CHK-1 program in oncology. The program included Genentech's compound GDC-0425 (RG7602) and Array's compound GDC-0575 (previously known as ARRY-575). Genentech selected GDC-0575 to advance into further clinical trials in patients with cancer.


• | Loxo – We entered into a Drug Discovery Collaboration Agreement with Loxo in July 2013 and granted Loxo exclusive rights to develop and commercialize certain Array-invented compounds targeted at the tropomyosin kinase, or Trk, family of receptors, including larotrectinib, which is currently in a Phase 2/registration clinical trial. In May 2018, Loxo announced that it had filed an NDA with the FDA for larotrectinib and had been granted priority review. The FDA has set a target action date of November 26, 2018, under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). Loxo is also advancing Array-invented LOXO-195, a Trk inhibitor, and LOXO-292, a Ret inhibitor, in Phase 1 / 2 clinical trials.

Business History
We have received a total of $1.2 billion in research funding and up-front and milestone payments from partners from inception through June 30, 2018. Our existing partnered programs provide Array the potential to receive up to a total of over $2.7 billion in additional milestone payments if we or our partners achieve the drug discovery, development and commercialization objectives detailed in those agreements. We also have the potential to earn royalties on any resulting product sales or share in the proceeds from licensing or commercialization from 17 partnered clinical and discovery programs. Potential milestone payments we may receive in the future are further described in Note 4 – Collaboration and Other Agreements to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Strategy
We are a fully-integrated, biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of transformative and well-tolerated targeted small molecule drugs to treat patients afflicted with cancer and other high-burden diseases. 
Our strategy includes the following elements:

• | Inventing best-in-class small molecule drugs for patient populations which have significant unmet medical need;


• | Conducting clinical trials which maximize the overall value of our programs for patients and Array;


• | Building and maintaining an oncology focused sales, marketing and medical organization to commercialize our products in the U.S.; and


• | Selectively partnering with early-stage research programs outside oncology.

Our out-license and collaboration agreements typically provide for up-front payments, research funding, success-based milestone payments and/or royalties on product sales. These agreements may also be structured to share in the proceeds received from a collaborator resulting from the further development or commercialization of resulting drugs.
Drug Discovery and Clinical Development Programs
We have collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies under which we have out-licensed certain proprietary drug programs for further research, development and commercialization. Under certain of our current partnered programs, our involvement in the development or research phase has ended, but we retain the right to receive clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones and/or royalties on sales of any products covered by the collaboration. We also have research collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for which we design, create and optimize drug candidates and conduct preclinical testing across a broad range of 
11

therapeutic areas on targets selected by our partners. In certain of these collaborations, we also perform process research and development and clinical development.
Information about our partners that comprise 10% or more of our total revenue and information about revenue we receive within and outside the U.S. can be found in Note 1 – Overview, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Concentration of Business Risks to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Partnered Development Programs 
Below are summaries of the most advanced partnered development programs. Any information we report about the development plans or the progress or results of clinical trials or other development activities of our partners is based on information that has been reported to us or is otherwise publicly disclosed by our collaboration partners, and therefore may not reflect changes to any information that may have occurred since the date it was reported to us or of its public disclosure. 
1. Asahi Kasei Pharma — AK-1830 TRKA Program
In March 2016, we entered into a strategic collaboration with AKP to develop and commercialize select preclinical Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) inhibitors, including Array-invented AK-1830, for pain, inflammation and other non-cancer indications. AKP is currently advancing a Phase 1 clinical trial of AK-1830 in patients with inflammatory disease in Japan. We have received $13.0 million up-front and milestone payments to date and may receive up to $62.5 million in additional development and commercialization milestone payments, including up to double-digit royalties on future sales. We will retain full commercialization rights for all compounds in all indications in territories outside of Asia and within Asia retain full rights to cancer indications for all compounds excluding those being developed by AKP.
2. ASLAN — Varlitinib Pan-HER Program 
In July 2011, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with ASLAN to develop Array's pan-HER inhibitor, varlitinib. ASLAN is currently advancing registration trials of varlitinib in patients with biliary tract cancer or gastric cancer in Asia. In January 2018, we entered into a second License Agreement with ASLAN pursuant to which we granted ASLAN full global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize varlitinib. The License Agreement replaces and supersedes the Collaboration and License Agreement. Array received a $23.0 million upfront payment under the 2018 License Agreement and may receive up to $105.0 million in additional development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments, including double-digit royalties on future sales.
3. AstraZeneca — Selumetinib — MEK Program 

In December 2003, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with AstraZeneca to develop our MEK program. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca acquired exclusive worldwide rights to our clinical development candidate, selumetinib (previously known as AZD6244, or ARRY-142886), together with two other compounds for oncology indications which we invented during the collaboration for oncology indications. AstraZeneca continues to advance selumetinib in SPRINT, the Phase 2 registration trial, in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. On July 26, 2018, AstraZeneca and MSD reported that the Phase 3 ASTRA trial of selumetinib in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) did not meet its primary endpoint. Trial results demonstrated that treatment with a short course of selumetinib and single dose adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy (RAI) did not meet its primary endpoint of improvement in complete remission (CR) rate compared to placebo. AstraZeneca estimates top-line results from the SPRINT trial during the second half of 2018. 
On July 28, 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck announced that they entered into an agreement to share the development and commercialization costs for selumetinib monotherapy and non-PD-L1/PD-1 combination therapy opportunities. We remain eligible to receive from AstraZeneca milestones and royalties on all future selumetinib sales and now expect to receive a portion of certain consideration paid by Merck to AstraZeneca under this agreement.  We have informed AstraZeneca that we are disputing the consideration that AstraZeneca has paid us related to both upfront and potential future milestones under AstraZeneca's agreement with Merck.  Furthermore, prior to the announcement of the AstraZeneca/Merck agreement, we informed AstraZeneca of our position that the Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) development program is outside the permitted field of its license. We commenced legal proceedings against AstraZeneca on December 7, 2017 naming AstraZeneca as the defendant in New York State Court in Manhattan 
12

regarding this dispute. On February 1, 2018, we filed a second action against AstraZeneca AB in New York state court. We are seeking damages and a declaratory judgment in both actions.
We retained the rights to all therapeutic indications for MEK compounds not selected by AstraZeneca for development, subject to the parties' agreement to work exclusively together. In April 2009, the exclusivity of the parties' relationship ended, and both companies are now free to independently research, develop and commercialize small molecule MEK inhibitors in the field of oncology. Our research obligations ended in 2004 and AstraZeneca is responsible for all future development and commercialization of the compounds under the collaboration. To date, we have earned $26.5 million in up-front and milestone payments. The agreement also provided for research funding, which is now complete, and provides potential additional development milestone payments of approximately $30.0 million specific for selumetinib and royalties on product sales.
4. Seattle Genetics — Tucatinib/ONT-380/ARRY-380 — HER2 Inhibitor Program
In May 2013, we entered into a Development and Commercialization Agreement with Cascadian Therapeutics (formerly Oncothyreon Inc.) to collaborate on the development and commercialization of tucatinib, an orally active, reversible and selective small-molecule HER2 inhibitor, for the treatment of cancer, including breast cancer, currently in Phase 2 / registration studies. Under the terms of the agreement, Cascadian Therapeutics paid us a one-time up-front fee of $10.0 million. 
In December 2014, we granted Cascadian Therapeutics an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize tucatinib pursuant to a License Agreement that replaced the 2013 agreement. As part of the License Agreement, Cascadian Therapeutics paid Array $20.0 million as an up-front fee. We are also entitled to receive up to a double-digit royalty based on net sales of tucatinib. In March 2018, Seattle Genetics acquired Cascadian Therapeutics and is responsible for the tucatinib program.
The License Agreement will expire on a country-by-country basis on the later of 10 years following the first commercial sale of the product in each respective country or expiration of the last to expire patent covering the product in such country, but may be terminated earlier by either party upon material breach of the License Agreement by the other party or the other party’s insolvency, or by Seattle Genetics on 180 days' notice to us. We and Seattle Genetics have also agreed to indemnify the other party in specified circumstances.
5. Genentech — Ipatasertib

We entered into a Drug Discovery Collaboration Agreement with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in December 2003 to develop small molecule drugs against multiple therapeutic targets in the field of oncology. We initiated this collaboration to advance two of our proprietary oncology programs into clinical development. These programs included small molecule leads we had developed along with additional, related intellectual property. Under the agreement, Genentech made an up-front payment, provided research funding and to date has paid us milestone payments for nominating a clinical candidate and advancing it into regulated safety assessment testing and a Phase 1 trial. In addition, Genentech has agreed to make additional potential development milestone payments and pay us royalties on certain resulting product sales. Genentech is solely responsible for clinical development and commercialization of the resulting products. 
In 2005, 2008, and 2009, we expanded our collaboration with Genentech to develop clinical candidates directed against additional targets. Under the agreement, we received additional research funding, as well as potential research and development milestone payments and product royalties based on the success of each new program. In September 2010, we and Genentech extended the agreement for an additional two years of funded research through January 2013. Genentech may terminate the agreement upon four months' written notice. Genentech has paid Array a total of $26.5 million in up-front and milestone payments, and we have the potential to earn an additional $20.0 million for all programs if Genentech continues development and achieves the remaining clinical milestones set forth in the agreement. 
Genentech is advancing one collaborative drug, ipatasertib, an AKT inhibitor, in Phase 3 trials in prostate or breast cancers.

6. Genentech — GDC-0575 — Checkpoint kinase 1, or CHK-1, Inhibitor Program

In August 2011, we entered into a License Agreement with Genentech for the development of each company's small-molecule CHK-1 program in oncology. The programs included Genentech's compound GDC-0425 (RG7602) and our compound GDC-0575 (previously known as ARRY-575), both of which are in Phase 1. Under the terms of the agreement, Genentech is responsible for all clinical development and commercialization activities. We received an up-front payment of $28.0 million and are eligible to receive clinical and commercial milestone payments up to $380.0 million and up to double-digit royalties on sales of any resulting drugs. The agreement will remain in effect until Genentech's obligations to make milestone or royalty payments have passed or expired. 
Either party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach by the other party that is not cured within a specified time period, and Genentech may terminate the agreement upon at least 60 days' written notice to us. If Genentech terminates the agreement due to a material breach by us, the license Array granted to Genentech becomes irrevocable and the royalty to us will be reduced to a specified percentage. If the agreement is terminated by Genentech for convenience or by us due to a material breach by Genentech, the license we granted to Genentech will terminate, Genentech will continue to be required to pay milestone and royalty payments on any programs for which Genentech had initiated clinical development and our exclusivity obligations will continue so long as Genentech is developing or commercializing at least one product subject to the agreement. Array and Genentech have also agreed to indemnify the other party for breaches of representations or warranties made under the agreement and for certain of their respective activities under the agreement. 
In 2014, Genentech selected GDC-0575 over GDC-0425 to advance into further clinical trials. Genentech completed a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose trial to evaluate GDC-0575 alone and in combination with Gemzar® (gemcitabine) in approximately 100 patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphoma. 

7. InterMune (program now owned by Roche/Ascletis) — Ganovo Hepatitis C Virus NS3/4 Protease Program 
In 2002, we entered into a Drug Discovery Collaboration Agreement with InterMune for the discovery of novel small molecule inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus, or HCV, NS3/4A protease. As a result of drug discovery activities under this collaboration, scientists at Array and InterMune jointly discovered Ganovo / danoprevir. In October 2010, Roche expanded its portfolio of investigational medicines for HCV through the purchase of Ganovo from InterMune for $175 million. InterMune thereafter ceased all further development efforts under the collaboration. In April 2014, Roche sublicensed rights to develop and commercialize Ganovo in China to Ascletis Pharmaceuticals. At this time, Roche and Ascletis are conducting all clinical development for Ganovo. Under the terms of our collaboration agreement with Roche, Roche has an obligation to make milestone payments to us based on the selection and progress of Ganovo, as well as royalties on commercial sales of Ganovo. To date, we have received $4.2 million in milestone payments and have the potential to earn an additional $5.0 million if all clinical and commercialization milestones for Ganovo are achieved under the agreement. Ganovo received marketing approval by the China Food and Drug Administration in June 2018. Ascletis has announced that it plans to commence commercial sales in the third quarter of 2018.
8. Lilly — Prexasertib/LY2606368 — CHK-1 Inhibitor Program 
In 1999 and 2000, we entered into collaboration agreements involving small-molecule CHK-1 inhibitors with ICOS Corporation. LY2603618 and prexasertib resulted from the collaboration between us and ICOS. Eli Lilly and Company acquired ICOS in 2007. We received $0.4 million in clinical milestone payments due to program advancements. We are entitled to receive additional milestone payments totaling $2.5 million based on Lilly's achievement of clinical and regulatory milestones with the program. Prexasertib is being studied in multiple Phase 1 or 2 trials for cancer. 
9. Loxo — Larotrectinib — PanTrk Inhibitor Program

In July 2013, we entered into a Drug Discovery Collaboration Agreement with Loxo which was subsequently amended in November 2013, April 2014, October 2014, March 2015 and February 2016. It granted Loxo exclusive rights to develop and commercialize certain Array-invented compounds including larotrectinib, which is currently in Phase 2/registration clinical trials.  In May 2018, Loxo announced that it had filed an NDA with the FDA for larotrectinib and had been granted priority review. The FDA has set a target action date of November 26, 2018, under the PDUFA. LOXO-195, a next-generation TRK inhibitor, and LOXO-292, a RET inhibitor, are also advancing in Phase 1. 
Under the terms of the amended agreement, Loxo is funding further discovery and preclinical programs to be conducted by Array, including a FGFR program.  The most recent amended agreement extended the term through September 
14

2017, with Loxo retaining an option to extend the term for up to one additional year. During June 2017, Loxo exercised its option to extend the term through September 2018. Loxo is responsible for all additional preclinical and clinical development and commercialization. 
We receive advance payments for the preclinical research and other services that we are providing during the term of the discovery program. To date, we have earned $13.0 million in milestone and other upfront payments and have the potential to earn up to approximately (i) $437.0 million with respect to products related to TRK, including larotrectinib and its backup compounds, and (ii) $209.0 million with respect to product candidates directed to targets other than TRK, if Loxo achieves additional clinical, regulatory and sales milestones plus royalties on sales of any resulting drugs. 
The Loxo agreement, as amended, will continue on a country-by-country basis until the termination of the royalty payment obligations, unless terminated earlier by the parties in accordance with its terms.  The agreement may be terminated by either party upon the failure of the other party to cure any material breach of its obligations under the agreement, provided that, so long as Loxo is reasonably able to pay its debts as they are due, we will only be entitled to seek monetary damages, and will not have the right to terminate the agreement in the event of Loxo's breach after expiration of the discovery program term.  Loxo also has the right to terminate the agreement or to terminate discovery research with respect to any targets under development with six months’ notice to us.  If Loxo terminates the agreement for convenience, all licenses granted to Loxo will terminate and we will have all rights to further develop and commercialize the licensed programs. The period of exclusivity to be observed by us under the Loxo agreement will continue as long as Loxo either has an active research and/or development program for a target and the program could result in the receipt of milestones or royalties under the program by Array, or as long as Loxo is commercializing a product for a target under the agreement.
10. VentiRx (now owned by Celgene) — Motolimod/VTX-2337 — TLR Program
In February 2007, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with the privately-held biopharmaceutical company VentiRx, under which we granted VentiRx exclusive worldwide rights to certain molecules from our TLR program. In February 2017, VentiRx was acquired by Celgene. The program contains a number of compounds targeting TLRs to activate innate immunity, including motolimod/VTX-2337, which is currently in Phase 2. We received equity in VentiRx, as well as an up-front payment and the right to receive potential milestone payments and royalties on product sales. To date, we have received $2.6 million in milestone payments and have the potential to earn an additional $56 million if Celgene achieves the remaining clinical and commercial milestones under the agreement. 
Market Opportunity

Our proprietary pipeline is focused on targeted drugs that treat cancer. We believe there is a substantial opportunity in creating oncology drugs that meet the demand from the medical community for targeted therapies that treat both the underlying disease, as well as control symptoms more effectively and/or more safely than drugs that are currently available. We believe future patient care will improve with the use of screening to select targeted therapies for more effective disease treatment. Also, clinical trials aimed at well-defined patient populations may show improved response rates and may thereby increase the chances for approval with regulatory agencies such as the FDA. This approach may result in a greater number of marketed drugs each aimed at a smaller subset of patients.
The worldwide market for targeted cancer drugs, the cancer drug market's fastest growing segment, is forecast to grow from $102 billion in 2017 to $191 billion in 2022.
Cancer Market 
Despite a wide range of available cancer therapies, patients' treatment responses remain limited and variable. As a result, oncologists are increasingly using combination therapies and drug dosing regimens tailored for individual tumor types and patients. The goal of targeted therapies is to specifically address the underlying mechanisms of the disease by regulating discrete aspects of cellular function affecting cancer cells to a greater extent than normal cells. As such, targeted therapies hold the promise of being more effective with fewer side effects than cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs. Further, biomarkers are increasingly playing a role in both patient prognosis and drug selection. We believe certain cancers will eventually become chronic diseases, treated with a combination of targeted therapies. Our research strategy in the cancer market is to build a pipeline of targeted therapies to be used as targeted combination regimens or in combination with immunotherapy agents including PD1 inhibitors. 
15

According to estimates contained in the American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts and Figures 2018, in the U.S. there will be an estimated 1.7 million new cases of cancer in 2018 and just over 600 thousand cancer-related deaths. The five-year relative survival rate for all cancers diagnosed between 2003 and 2009 is 68%, up from 49% in 1975-1977. The improvement in survival reflects both progress in diagnosing certain cancers at an earlier stage and improvements in treatment.
The following table shows estimated new cases diagnosed and estimated deaths in the U.S. during 2018 by major cancer types of interest to us:

 | Estimated 2018
Type of Cancer | New Cases | Deaths
Lung | 234,030 | | 154,050
Breast | 268,670 | | 41,400 
Colon & rectum (combined) | 140,250 | | 50,630 
Melanoma | 91,270 | | 9,320 
Pancreas | 55,440 | | 44,330 
Ovarian | 22,240 | | 14,070 
Stomach | 26,240 | | 10,800 
Myeloma | 30,770 | | 12,770 
Gallbladder and Other Biliary | 12,190 | | 3,790 
 | 881,100 | | 341,160

The use of targeted therapies has the potential to change the focus of cancer treatment away from categorization and treatment modality by organ type and towards categorization and treatment modalities by level of gene expression in individual patients, or “personalized medicine.” Targeted therapies and personalized medicine hold the promise of increased survival with improved quality of life.
Oncology, both in treating cancer itself and as palliative therapy, has been a major therapeutic category for biotechnology companies since the inception of the industry. Recently, major pharmaceutical companies have increased their research and development and in-licensing investment in this market, particularly the targeted cancer therapy market. Some of the targeted therapies currently on the market include bevacizumab, crizotinib, trastuzumab, rituximab and vemurafenib.
In addition to targeted therapies, immunotherapy agents that target PD1 have gained approval across multiple tumor types including melanoma, NSCLC, Merkel cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma. Recently, Merck’s pembrolizumab and BMS’ nivolumab (as a single agent or in combination with ipilimumab have been approved for patients with microsatellite instable (MSI) colorectal cancer. In melanoma, pembrolizumab and BMS’ nivolumab have become major players with significant market share. One area of particular interest for us is developing combination therapies of proprietary targeted therapies and PD1 inhibitors in order to address a broader range of patients. 
Melanoma (Encorafenib — BRAF inhibitor and Binimetinib — MEK inhibitor)
Market growth of melanoma drug therapies is expected to be strong, with sales across the worldwide markets forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 14% from $3.7 billion in 2016 to $8.1 billion in 2022. This forecasted growth is driven largely by recent and anticipated launches of several novel, high-priced therapies expected to capture substantial market share over time.
Melanoma develops when unrepaired DNA damage to skin cells triggers mutations that may lead them to multiply and form malignant tumors. Metastatic melanoma is the most serious and life-threatening type of skin cancer and is associated with low survival rates. There are a variety of gene mutations that can lead to metastatic melanoma. The most common genetic mutation in metastatic melanoma is BRAF. There are about 200,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed worldwide each year, approximately half of which have BRAF mutations, a key target in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.
The optimal treatment for melanoma varies with the stage of the disease. In patients with early disease, surgical excision can be followed by adjuvant therapy with interferon alpha, ipilimumab, Nivolumab, or dabrafenib + trametinib. 
16

Array's BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI, Novartis’ trametinib and dabrafenib and Roche’s vemurafenib and cobimetinib are currently approved for the treatment of melanoma patients with BRAF mutations. 
Colorectal Cancer (Binimetinib - MEK inhibitor and Encorafenib - BRAF inhibitor)
Worldwide, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in men and the second most common in women, with approximately 1.4 million new diagnoses in 2012. Globally in 2012, approximately 694,000 deaths were attributed to colorectal cancer. In the U.S. alone, an estimated 140,250 patients will be diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum in 2018, and approximately 50,000 are estimated to die of their disease. In the U.S., BRAF mutations are estimated to occur in 10% to 15% of patients with colorectal cancer and represent a poor prognosis for these patients. The risk of mortality in CRC patients with the BRAFV600E mutation is more than two times higher than for those with wild-type BRAF. Several irinotecan and cetuximab-containing regimens, similar to the BEACON CRC control arm, have established clinical activity benchmarks in BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC patients, whose disease has progressed after one or two prior lines of therapy. The benchmarks include ORR of 4% to 8%, mPFS of 1.8 to 2.5 months and mOS of 4 to 6 months. Overall, with the addition of new treatment options to address existing and emerging biomarkers, the total CRC market is forecast to grow from $7.0 billion in 2014 to $7.6 billion in 2023.
Treatment for patients diagnosed with localized disease centers around surgery, with or without adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens. Advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer is managed through the use of chemotherapy or monoclonal antibodies targeted against the EGFR or VEGF signaling pathways. The EGFR surface protein is overexpressed in approximately 40-80% of CRC tumors, and the EGFR-targeted therapies cetuximab (cetuximab) and panitumumab are FDA-approved for use in CRC patients. However, EGFR overexpression is not predictive of treatment efficacy, and only approximately 10-20% of CRC patients respond to EGFR-directed therapies. Targeting VEGF through the use of bevacizumab or ramucirumab is also an available treatment modality. However, despite use of these targeted agents against EGFR and VEGF, there remains high unmet need for additional therapies that target additional mutations in CRC patients. 
We, in partnership with Pierre Fabre and Merck KGaA, have initiated the Phase 3 BEACON CRC trial to evaluate encorafenib and binimetinib in combination with cetuximab in patients with BRAF-mutated metastatic CRC who have progressed on first-line systemic therapy. Patients are to be randomized to receive the triplet therapy, doublet therapy of encorafenib and cetuximab, or a cetuximab and chemotherapy control arm. OS of the triplet therapy compared with the control arm will be evaluated as the primary endpoint; PFS, ORR, DOR, safety and tolerability are secondary endpoints. 
Recently, CRC tumors have come to also be defined by the level of microsatellite stability or instability displayed, and pembrolizumab was approved by the FDA in May 2017 for the treatment of patients (including those with CRC) whose tumors display high levels of microsatellite instability. Recently, pembrolizumab and nivolumab (as a single agent or in combination with ipilimumab) have been approved for the treatment of this population. In addition, BMS has also submitted an application with FDA for the approval of nivolumab for the treatment of CRC patients with MSI-H tumors. However, despite the encouraging activity of PD1 inhibitors in MSI-H CRC, these tumors only account for approximately 5% of CRC in the U.S. To address the larger population of CRC patients with microsatellite stable tumors, we have initiated two collaborations with Merck and BMS to combine binimetinib with pembrolizumab or nivolumab in CRC patients with MSS tumors. 
NF1 or Plexiform Neurofibromas (Selumetinib and Binimetinib - MEK inhibitors)
NF1 is an autosomal disorder that can cause tumors to grow on nerves throughout the body. Most of these tumors are inoperable and the disease may lead to blindness, bone abnormalities, cancer, deafness, disfigurement, learning disabilities and excruciating and disabling pain. Neurofibromatosis, or NF, affects one in every 3,000 people, which is more than cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Huntington’s disease combined. Data on selumetinib from the Phase 2 SPRINT trial of pediatric patients with NF1 was presented at the 2018 ASCO Annual Meeting. In the study, 72% (16 of 24) of patients treated with selumetinib achieved a partial response.

Lamin A/C-Related Dilated Cardiomyopathy (ARRY-797 — p38 inhibitor)
LMNA-DCM is a rare, degenerative cardiovascular disease caused by genetic mutations in the lamin A/C gene. These mutations lead to loss of functional lamin proteins resulting in activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and leading to structural changes in cardiac tissue such as alterations to cardiomyocyte and A/V nodal cell nuclei, which leads to apoptosis and cardiac tissue remodeling, and sarcomere reorganization, which affects the heart’s contractile function. While other MAPK pathways have been implicated in this disease, nonclinical data suggest that the p38 pathway is a key driver.
Patients with LMNA-DCM typically begin experiencing symptoms in their twenties or thirties, and by age 45 nearly 70% have undergone a heart transplant, experienced a major cardiac event or have died. Currently, there are no disease-specific treatments approved for LMNA-DCM. Treatment is limited to symptomatic and supportive care, and a significant unmet medical need remains for therapies that can halt disease progression or improve cardiac function. Patients diagnosed with LMNA-DCM are treated using the same practices as patients diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy arising from other causes. It is estimated that 5,000 to 9,000 patients are living with LMNA-DCM, but due to infrequent genetic testing, far fewer are actually diagnosed. No available treatments are curative, and given the relentless progression of disease and poor prognosis of LMNA-DCM, novel drugs that can target the molecular mechanism underlying cardiac dysfunction in this disease are warranted. Thus, there is a high unmet need for patients who are diagnosed with LMNA-DCM, and inhibition of p38 MAPK may offer an important therapeutic option for these patients.
We are currently developing ARRY-797, a selective, oral inhibitor of the p38 MAPK pathway, which is currently in Phase 3 in patients with LMNA-DCM. 
Research and Development for Proprietary Drug Discovery 
Our primary research efforts during fiscal 2018 were focused on development of our oncology programs. Our research focuses on biologic functions, or pathways, that have been identified as important in the treatment of human disease based on human clinical, genetic or preclinical data. Within these pathways, we seek to create first-in-class drugs regulating important therapeutic targets to treat patients with serious or life-threatening conditions, primarily in cancer. In addition, we seek to identify opportunities to improve upon existing therapies or drugs in clinical development by creating clinical candidates with superior, or best-in-class, drug characteristics, including efficacy, tolerability or dosing to provide safer, more effective drugs. During fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, we spent $185.8 million, $178.2 million and $160.7 million, respectively, on research and development for proprietary drug discovery, which consist of costs associated with our proprietary drug programs for, among other things, salaries and benefits for scientific personnel, consulting and outsourced services, laboratory supplies, allocated facilities costs and depreciation. 
Drug Discovery and Development Timeline
The drug development process is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks that are beyond our control and takes many years to complete. The following table outlines each phase in the drug development process. Completion times are difficult to estimate and can vary greatly based on the drug and indication. Therefore, the duration times shown in the table below are estimates only. 
18


Phase | Objective | Estimated Duration
Discovery | Lead identification and target validation. | 1 to 2 years 
Preclinical | Initial toxicology for preliminary identification of risks for humans; gather early pharmacokinetic data. | 2 to 4 years 
Phase 1 | Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drug in human subjects and find the maximum tolerated dose. The pharmacokinetics of the drug are examined after single and multiple doses, the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics may be evaluated and drug metabolites may be monitored. | 1 to 2 years 
Phase 2 | Evaluate effectiveness of the drug and its optimal dosage in patients; continue safety evaluation. | 2 to 4 years 
Phase 3 | Confirm efficacy, dosage regime and safety profile of the drug in patients. | 2 to 4 years 
NDA Preparation, Review and Approval | FDA review and approval to sell and market the drug under the approved labeling. | 1 to 2 years 

Some non-clinical studies, including animal studies, are often conducted during the course of human clinical studies. Proof-of-concept for a drug candidate generally occurs during Phase 2, after initial safety and efficacy data are established. 
Preclinical Research 
We have a broad drug discovery platform with all the necessary capabilities to efficiently invent new chemical compounds. We continue to add to our breadth of knowledge, refine our processes and engage key scientists in academia who enhance our current capabilities and keep us current with new science and methodologies. Our translational medicine team designs and runs mechanistic studies in cell biology and pharmacology to provide insight into clinical development strategy, product differentiation and biomarker support for clinical development. Our discovery group continues to create high quality clinical candidates for our proprietary and partnered programs that selectively engage their mechanistic target and prove or disprove the pharmacological hypothesis either by a relevant human biomarker or by direct efficacy assessments.
Clinical Development 
Our current key capabilities within clinical development include clinical science, clinical operations, clinical pharmacology, drug safety and pharmacovigilance, biostatistics, programming and data management, regulatory strategy and program management. This group leads the development and implementation of our clinical and regulatory strategies. The clinical group designs, directs and implements all clinical operations, including identifying and selecting clinical investigators, recruiting study subjects to participate in our clinical trials, biostatistics, data management, drug safety evaluation and adverse event reporting. The clinical group also is responsible for ensuring that our development programs are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements. The group also works closely with the cross functional project and clinical teams to facilitate the appropriate and efficient development of our diverse product pipeline. 
The focus of our research and development effort is on continuing to explore opportunities for and develop data sets to guide use of our marketed products, BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI, including the design and conduct of registration trials for new indications. Our early development strategy is to efficiently conduct studies to demonstrate the value of each program in a therapeutic area so that decisions to continue, modify or cease development of a program can be made early in the development process. We believe that our broad development pipeline and productive discovery platform provide an incentive to design trials for each program with high hurdles to either demonstrate the potential of the drug or to "fail early."
Manufacturing and Product Supply
We currently contract with third-party, contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) for the manufacture of BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI commercial and clinical supply. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities, nor do we have plans in place to build or acquire our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. Although 
19

we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our contract manufacturers. To date, our third-party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements. We expect our CMOs to provide sufficient quantities of BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI to meet current and future market demand for both products. Should any of our other drug candidates obtain marketing approval, we anticipate establishing relationships with third-party manufacturers and other service providers in connection with commercial production of those products. 
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
In anticipation of FDA approval of BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI, we put in place an experienced commercial leadership team and infrastructure, which includes nearly 60 customer-facing employees. We have experienced, senior-level sales, marketing and market access employees based at headquarters leading our sales force and strategic account managers who are based in the field. 
Array launched BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI in the United States in July 2018 following FDA approval for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutation. We promote our products utilizing customary pharmaceutical practices with a focus on oncologists, advanced practice practitioners and pharmacists. We distribute BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI through a limited set of specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies with expertise in oral oncology products, which in turn, resell our products to hospitals and oncology clinics, or directly to patients. 
While Array retains the commercial rights to both products in Canada, we have established regional partnerships with three outside organizations to commercialize BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI in other territories around the world. Ono Pharmaceutical now has exclusive rights to commercialize both products in Japan and South Korea, Medison holds exclusive rights to commercialize both products in Israel and Pierre Fabre owns exclusive rights to commercialize both products in all other countries, including those in Europe, Asia and Latin America.
BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI are not approved outside of the United States. The EMA, Swissmedic, TGA, and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan are currently reviewing the Marketing Authorization Applications for BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI.
Competitors 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapid and continuous technological innovation. We compete with companies worldwide that are engaged in research and discovery, licensing, development and commercialization of drug candidates, including large pharmaceutical companies with internal discovery and development functions, biotech companies with competing products in the therapeutic areas we are targeting and contract research organizations, or CROs, that perform many of the functions we perform under our collaborations. In addition, we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking to out-license drugs targeting the same disease class or condition as our drug candidates are based on, among other things, patent position, product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, patient convenience, price and reimbursement potential. Therefore, we may be unable to enter into collaboration, partnering or out-licensing agreements on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We also compete with other clinical trials for patients who are eligible to be enrolled in clinical trials we or our partners are conducting, which may limit the number of patients who meet the criteria for enrollment and delay or prevent us or our partners from completing trials when anticipated. Because the timing of entry of a drug in the market presents important competitive advantages, the speed with which we are able to complete drug development and clinical trials, obtain regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of drugs to the market will affect our competitive position. Some of our competitors have a broader range of capabilities and have greater access to financial, technical, scientific, regulatory, business development, recruiting and other resources than we do. Their access to greater resources may allow them to develop processes or products that are more effective, safer or less costly, or gain greater market acceptance, than products we develop or for which they obtain FDA approval more rapidly than we do. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
Government Regulation 
Biopharmaceutical companies are subject to substantial regulation by governmental agencies in the U.S. and other countries. Virtually all pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation, including regulation governing the testing, development, manufacturing, quality control, distribution, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, advertising and promotion, and import and export of such 
20

products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and its implementing regulations, and by comparable agencies and laws in foreign countries. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory agency or FDA requirements may result in enforcement action, including warning letters, fines, civil or criminal penalties, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the U.S., which is our primary initial focus, we and our partners anticipate seeking approval to market our products in other countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the U.S., although there can be important differences.
Development and Approval
In the U.S., prescription drug products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures by the FDA. Under the FDC Act, the FDA must approve any new drug, including a new dosage form or new use of a previously approved drug, prior to marketing in the U.S. Typically, approval requires extensive studies and submission of a large amount of data by the company. The approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that the FDA will grant approval for any of our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. 
Preclinical Testing. Before testing any drug candidate in human subjects in the U.S., a company must develop extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. Certain animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Welfare Act.
IND Application. Human clinical trials cannot commence until an IND application is submitted and becomes effective. A company must submit, among other information, preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND, and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug candidate in initial clinical studies in human volunteers. Unless the FDA raises concerns, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. 
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with the FDA's bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. FDA reviews each protocol that is submitted to the IND. In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by, and conducted under the auspices of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each institution conducting the clinical trial. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects, complying with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting adverse events. Foreign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the U.S. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND may be submitted in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and, if necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection, if the agency deems such inspection necessary.
Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another. Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial introduction of a drug in humans on a small scale, and are generally intended to develop data regarding metabolism, pharmacologic action and safety, as well as helping determine the maximum tolerated dose. They also may provide early information regarding effectiveness. Phase 2 trials typically are controlled studies conducted in larger numbers of patients to gather initial effectiveness and safety data for specific indications. Phase 3 studies usually are intended to develop additional effectiveness and safety data, in order to allow evaluation of the drug’s overall benefit/risk profile and provide a basis for labeling.
During any of these phases, the sponsoring company, the FDA, or an IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Further, success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.
21

NDA Submission and Review. After completing clinical testing of an investigational drug, a sponsor must prepare and submit an NDA for review and approval by the FDA. When an NDA is submitted, the FDA conducts a preliminary review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to be accepted for filing. If it is not, the FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information, and review of the application is delayed.
As part of its review, the FDA may refer an NDA to an advisory committee for evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. Although the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, the agency usually has followed such recommendations. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain applications for approval must include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug or biological product in relevant pediatric populations. The FDA may waive or defer the requirement for a pediatric assessment, either at the company’s request or by the agency’s initiative. The FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks. A REMS may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is to be manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
If the FDA concludes that an NDA does not meet the regulatory standards for approval, the FDA typically issues a Complete Response letter communicating the agency’s decision not to approve the application and outlining the deficiencies in the submission. The Complete Response letter also may request further information, including additional preclinical or clinical data. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA still does not meet the standards for approval.
Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor. Obtaining regulatory approval often takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources, and depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the disease or condition the drug is intended to address, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. Additionally, as a condition of approval, the FDA may impose restrictions that could affect the commercial success of a drug or require post-approval commitments, including the completion within a specified time period of additional clinical studies, which often are referred to as “Phase 4” or “post-marketing” studies.
Certain post-approval modifications to the drug product, such as changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical or clinical trials, to be submitted in a new or supplemental NDA, which would require FDA approval.
Post-Approval Regulation
Even if regulatory approvals are granted, a marketed product is subject to continuing comprehensive requirements under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including requirements and restrictions regarding adverse event reporting, recordkeeping, marketing, and compliance with cGMP. Adverse events reported after approval of a drug can result in additional restrictions on the use of a drug or requirements for additional post-marketing studies or clinical trials. The FDA or similar agencies in other countries may also require labeling changes to products at any time based on new safety information. If ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market, the FDA or similar agencies in other countries may at any time withdraw product approval or take actions that would suspend marketing or approval. 
Good Manufacturing Practices. Companies engaged in manufacturing drug products or their components must comply with applicable cGMP requirements and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. If, after receiving approval, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process (all of which are, to some degree, incorporated in the NDA), additional regulatory review and approval may be required. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements and conditions of product approval may lead the FDA to seek sanctions, including fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution.
22

Advertising and Promotion. The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for advertising, promotion to physicians and patients, communications regarding unapproved uses, and industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and other restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and state authorities, as well as civil and criminal fines and agreements that may materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.
Other Requirements. In addition, companies that manufacture or distribute drug products or that hold approved NDAs must comply with other regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, submitting establishment registrations and drug listings, and maintaining certain records.
Hatch-Waxman Act
If drug candidates we develop are approved for commercial marketing under an NDA by the FDA, they would be subject to the provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the "Hatch-Waxman Act." The Hatch-Waxman Act establishes two abbreviated approval pathways for drug products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved NDA products. In addition, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides companies with marketing exclusivity for new chemical entities, allows companies to apply to extend for up to five additional years of patent term lost during product development and FDA review of an NDA, and provides for a period of marketing exclusivity for products that are not new chemical entities if the NDA (or supplemental NDA) contains data from new clinical investigations that were necessary for approval. It also provides a means for approving generic versions of a drug product once the marketing exclusivity period has ended and all relevant patents have expired or have been successfully challenged and defeated. The laws of other key markets likewise create both opportunities for exclusivity periods and patent protections and the possibility of generic competition once such periods or protections have either expired or have been successfully challenged by generic entrants.
Orphan Drug Exclusivity
The Orphan Drug Act established incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200 thousand individuals in the U.S. at the time of the request for orphan designation. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition and meets other applicable requirements, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to the product for that use. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation for the following products for the identified intended uses: (i) filanesib for use in treating MM in May 2014; (ii) ARRY-797 for use in treating LMNA-DCM in May 2014; (iii) binimetinib for use in treating LGSOC in July 2014; (iv) binimetinib for use in treating stage IIB-IV melanoma in November 2013; and (v) encorafenib and binimetinib for treatment of stage IIB-IV melanoma that is positive for BRAF mutation in November 2013. The benefits of orphan drug designation include tax credits for clinical testing expenses and exemption from user fees. A drug that is approved for the orphan drug designated use typically is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity. 
Pediatric Exclusivity
Section 505A of the FDC Act provides for six months of additional exclusivity if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be safe and effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection that cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. If any of our product candidates is approved, we anticipate seeking pediatric exclusivity when it is appropriate.
Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations
Certain of our product candidates may qualify for Fast Track designation. The Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical 
23

needs involving serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. If a drug receives Fast Track designation, the FDA may consider reviewing sections of the NDA on a rolling basis, rather than requiring the entire application to be submitted to begin the review. Products with Fast Track designation also may be eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondence with the FDA about the product's development. Certain of our product candidates may benefit from other FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review (i.e., a six-month review goal, rather than the standard 10-month timeframe) and accelerated approval (i.e., approval on the basis of a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit).
Certain of our product candidates also may qualify for Breakthrough Therapy designation, which is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence shows that the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. If a drug receives Breakthrough Therapy designation, it will be eligible for all of the benefits of Fast Track designation. In addition, Breakthrough Therapy-designated drugs are eligible for more intensive guidance from the FDA on an efficient drug development program and a commitment from the agency to involve senior FDA managers in such guidance.
Even if a product qualifies for Fast Track designation or Breakthrough Therapy designation, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification, and/or may determine that the product does not meet the standards for approval.
Companion Diagnostics
Diagnostic tests are regulated as medical devices under the FDC Act. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. The diagnostic tests being developed for our lead products are subject to the PMA approval process.
PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures. FDA is required by statute to complete its review of an initial PMA application within six to ten months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. If FDA’s evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter. The latter usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and the data are submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval, or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
In 2014, the FDA issued its final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for in vitro companion diagnostic devices. According to the guidance, for novel therapeutic products such as our product candidate binimetinib, the companion diagnostic device generally should be approved or cleared contemporaneously with the drug candidate, although the guidance allows for certain exceptions. We believe our program for the development of our lead products and its companion diagnostic is consistent with this guidance. 
Biological Samples
In the course of our business, we handle, store and dispose of chemicals and biological samples. We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. These environmental laws generally impose liability regardless of the negligence or fault of a party and may expose us to liability for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, others.
24

Privacy
Most health care providers, including research institutions from which we or our partners obtain patient information, are subject to privacy and security regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. Our clinical research efforts are not directly regulated by HIPAA. However, depending on the facts and circumstances, we could face substantial criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain, use or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA In addition, we and our partners may be directly subject to certain data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). 
In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, state genetic privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act). International data protection laws including the European Union, or EU, Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (the EU Data Protection Directive) may apply to some or all of the clinical data obtained outside of the U.S. The EU Data Protection Directive, as implemented into national laws by the EU Member States, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The EU Data Protection Directive prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area, or EEA, such as the U.S., which are not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection. Switzerland has adopted similar restrictions. Although there are legal mechanisms to allow for the transfer of personal data from the EEA and Switzerland to the U.S., a recent decision of the European Court of Justice that invalidated the safe harbor framework has increased uncertainty around compliance with EU privacy law requirements. As a result of the decision, it will no longer be possible to rely on safe harbor certification as a legal basis for the transfer of personal data from the EU to entities in the U.S. In addition, data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may interpret the EU Data Protection Directive and national laws differently, and guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. In February 2016, the European Commission announced an agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, or DOC, to replace the invalidated Safe Harbor framework with a new EU-U.S. “Privacy Shield.” On July 12, 2016, the European Commission adopted a decision on the adequacy of the protection provided by the Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is intended to address the requirements set out by the European Court of Justice in its recent ruling invalidating safe harbor by imposing more stringent obligations on companies, providing stronger monitoring and enforcement by the DOC and FTC, and making commitments on the part of public authorities regarding access to information. U.S. companies are able to certify to the DOC their compliance with the privacy principles of the Privacy Shield since August 1, 2016. In December 2015, a proposal for an EU General Data Protection Regulation, intended to replace the current EU Data Protection Directive, was agreed between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, which was officially adopted in April 2016 and will be applicable in May 2018, will introduce new data protection requirements in the EU, as well as substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The EU General Data Protection Regulation will increase our responsibility and liability in relation to any personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new EU data protection rules. 
Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, patients about whom we or our partners obtain information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may have contractual rights that limit our ability to use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals' privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.
United States Healthcare Reform
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, together the Healthcare Reform Act, was adopted in the U.S. This law substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Healthcare Reform Act contains a number of provisions that are expected to impact our business and operations, in some cases in ways we cannot currently predict. Changes that may affect our business if we or our 
25

partners commercialize our products in the future include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, and fraud and abuse and enforcement. In addition, continued implementation of the Healthcare Reform Act may result in the expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives, and may impact existing government healthcare programs, such as by improving the physician quality reporting system and feedback program.
Additional provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act may negatively affect our revenues from products that we or our partners commercialize in the future. For example, as part of the Healthcare Reform Act's provisions closing a coverage gap that currently exists in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, manufacturers of branded prescription drugs are required to provide a 50% discount on branded prescription drugs dispensed to beneficiaries within this coverage gap. Medicare Part D is a prescription drug benefit available to all Medicare beneficiaries. It is a voluntary benefit that is implemented through private plans under contractual arrangements with the federal government. Similar to pharmaceutical coverage through private health insurance, Part D plans negotiate discounts from drug manufacturers and pass on some of those savings to Medicare beneficiaries. The Healthcare Reform Act also makes changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, discussed in more detail below, including increasing the minimum rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price for most innovator products. On February 1, 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the Health Reform Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016.
Many of the Healthcare Reform Act's most significant reforms did not take effect until 2014 or thereafter, and the resulting new programs and requirements will continue to evolve in the next few years. Some states have chosen not to expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level. In part because not all states have expanded their Medicaid programs, it is unclear whether there will be more uninsured patients than anticipated when Congress passed the Healthcare Reform Act. For each state that has opted not to expand its Medicaid program, there will be fewer insured patients overall. An increase in the proportion of uninsured patients who are prescribed products resulting from our proprietary or partnered programs could impact the future sales of any products that are commercialized in the future and our business and results of operations. 
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
In U.S. markets, our ability and that of our partners to commercialize our products successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our products, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including, in the U.S., governmental payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. 
Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we will be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data that would be reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS. Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing discount program, or the 340B program, in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The ceiling price can represent a significant discount and is based on the pricing data reporting to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
The Healthcare Reform Act expanded the 340B program to include additional entity types: certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Healthcare Reform Act. The Healthcare Reform Act exempts drugs designated under section 526 of the FDC Act as “orphan drugs” from the ceiling price requirements for these newly-eligible entities. 
The Healthcare Reform Act also obligates HRSA to create regulations and processes to improve the integrity of the 340B program and to update the agreement that manufacturers must sign to participate in the 340B program. HRSA issued a proposed regulation in 2015 regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities. HRSA has indicated it plans to issue the final regulation regarding these topics in 2016. HRSA in 2015 also released proposed omnibus guidance that addresses many aspects of the 340B program. HRSA has indicated it plans to release the omnibus guidance in final form in 2016. HRSA recently issued a proposed regulation regarding an administrative 
26

dispute resolution process for the 340B program. Any final regulations and guidance could affect our obligations under the 340B program in ways we cannot anticipate. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or otherwise expand the 340B program.
Federal law also requires that for a drug manufacturer’s products to be eligible for payment with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and to be purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, the manufacturer must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Manufacturers that participate in the FSS pricing program must list their covered (innovator) drugs on an FSS contract and charge no more than Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP, to the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, Public Health Service, and Coast Guard when those agencies purchase from the FSS contract or a depot contract. FCP is calculated based on non-federal average manufacturer price data, which manufacturers must submit quarterly and annually. In addition, if our products become available in the retail pharmacy setting when they are commercialized, we would be required to provide rebates to the Department of Defense for prescriptions dispensed to Tricare beneficiaries from Tricare retail network pharmacies under the Tricare Retail Refund Program. These programs obligate the manufacturer to pay rebates and offer its drugs at certain prices to certain federal purchasers. To the extent we choose to participate in these government healthcare programs, these and other requirements may affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. 
Pricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and will often be subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. If we become aware that our reporting of pricing data for a prior quarter was incorrect, we will be obligated to resubmit the corrected data. For the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, corrected data must be submitted for a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental pricing programs.
We may be liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. If we are found to have knowingly submitted false pricing data to the Medicaid program or the FSS pricing program, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties in the amount of up to $100,000 per item of false information. Our failure to submit pricing data to the Medicaid program or the FSS pricing program on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty of $10,000 per day for each day the information is late. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, which is the agreement under which we would participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs. We cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found to be incomplete or incorrect.
Third-party payors decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement and co-pay levels. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products. Even with such studies, any of our products that are commercialized may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than other products, and third-party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement, in whole or in part, for our products.
Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the U.S. to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system and reimbursement systems in ways that could impact our ability and that of our partners to profitably sell commercialized products. 
Payors also are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost. It is difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payors to cover any of our products that are commercialized.
In addition, we anticipate that a significant portion of our or our partners' revenue from sales of commercialized products will be obtained through government payors, including Medicaid, and any failure to qualify for reimbursement for products we are able to commercialize under those programs would have a material adverse effect on revenues and royalties from sales of such products.
27

Interactions with Healthcare Providers
Healthcare providers, physicians and others often play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products. Manufacturers of branded prescription drugs are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which manufacturers market, sell and distribute the products for which they obtain marketing approval. Some of the laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate are described below.
Anti-Kickback Laws

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, and the government can establish a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute without proving that a person or entity had actual knowledge of the law or specific intent to violate it. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, however, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute, but the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on the totality of the facts and circumstances. A number of states also have anti-kickback laws that establish similar prohibitions that may apply to items or services reimbursed by government programs, as well as any third-party payors, including commercial payors.
False Claims Act
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds and knowingly making, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false claim paid. Certain marketing practices may implicate the federal civil False Claims Act, including promotion of pharmaceutical products for unapproved uses, providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customer would bill federal programs for the product, or inflating prices report to private price publication services used to set drug reimbursement rates under federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Act amended the Social Security Act to provide that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the government or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim or statement, which increased to a range of $10,957 to $21,916 for violations after November 2, 2015, and assessed after August 1, 2016. Because of the potential for large monetary exposure, healthcare companies often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and sometimes material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages and per claim penalties that may awarded in litigation proceedings. They may be required, however, to enter into corporate integrity agreements with the government, which may impose substantial costs on companies to ensure compliance. Pharmaceutical companies also are subject to other federal false claim laws, including laws that impose criminal penalties, including imprisonment and criminal fines, for making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

Physician Payment Sunshine Act
The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually (with certain exceptions) to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other ‘‘transfers of value’’ made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and payments or other ‘‘transfers of value’’ to such physician owners. 
Analogous State and Foreign Laws
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal laws described above, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws. These state laws apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. In addition, a number of states require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in the states. Other states restrict when pharmaceutical companies may provide meals to prescribers or engage in other marketing related activities, or require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct. Outside the U.S., we are subject to similar regulations in those countries where we market and sell products.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives and intermediaries from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.
Efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly for manufacturers of branded prescription products. If a manufacturer's operations, including activities conducted by its sales team, are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to the company, the company may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, including imprisonment, monetary penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations.
Other Regulatory Requirements
We are also subject to regulation by other regional, national, state and local agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other regulatory bodies. Our current and future partners are subject to many of the same requirements.
In addition, we are subject to other regulations, including regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, the Toxic Substance Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and regulations under other federal, state and local laws. 
Violations of any of the foregoing requirements could result in penalties being assessed against us. 

Intellectual Property 
Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our potential drug candidates, other intellectual property rights and our proprietary software technologies. To establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality provisions in our contracts with collaborators. 
Our patent strategy is designed to protect inventions, technology and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to our business in countries where we believe it is commercially reasonable and advantageous to do so. We have numerous U.S. patents and patent applications related to our clinical-stage programs as well as numerous patent applications and counterpart patent filings which relate to our preclinical programs and proprietary technologies.

These patents and patent applications include claims directed to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of treatment, and methods of making these compositions for multiple applications.
We have two issued U.S patents covering filanesib and related molecules, and their equivalent counterparts issued or pending in dozens of countries. These patents include composition of matter, method of treatment and combination therapy claims, which will expire on various dates in 2025. We believe that patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act could be available to extend our patent exclusivity for filanesib to at least 2030 in the United States depending on timing of our first approval. In Europe, we believe that patent term extension under a supplementary protection certificate could be available for an additional five years to at least 2030. Additionally, other patent applications are directed to methods of using filanesib and other combination therapies, which, if issued, have expiration dates between 2033 and 2034, excluding any patent term adjustment.
We have issued U.S. patents covering binimetinib, selumetinib and related molecules and their equivalent counterparts issued or pending in dozens of countries. These patents include composition of matter, method of treatment and synthetic method claims, which will expire on various dates in 2023 and 2024. We have also filed patent applications directed to methods of manufacturing, and to intermediates useful for manufacturing, binimetinib and selumetinib, which will expire on various dates in 2026 and 2027.

We own or have license rights under issued patents covering encorafenib and related molecules, as well and their equivalent counterparts in dozens of countries. These patents include composition of matter, method of treatment and combination therapy claims, which will expire on various dates in 2031. We believe that patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act could be available to extend our patent exclusivity for encorafenib to at least 2036 in the United States. In Europe, we believe that patent term extension under a supplementary protection certificate could be available for an additional five years to at least 2036. Additionally, other patent applications are directed to methods of using encorafenib, combination therapies and formulations, which, if issued, have expiration dates between 2032 and 2034, excluding any patent term adjustment.
We have issued patents covering ARRY-797 and related molecules and their equivalent counterparts in dozens of countries. These patents include composition of matter and method of treatment claims, which will expire on various dates in 2023. We believe that patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act could be available to extend our patent exclusivity for ARRY-797 to at least 2028 in the United States. In Europe, we believe that patent term extension under a supplementary protection certificate could be available for an additional five years to at least 2028.
Additionally, AstraZeneca has filed other patent applications directed to selumetinib, including patent applications of which we are not aware. Patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States and in Europe under a supplementary protection certificate could be available for each of our partners to extend patent exclusivity for these clinical candidates. AstraZeneca is entitled to decide which patent covering its product candidate will be subject to such efforts and whether to file other patent applications directed at its product candidate. Our partners do not share information with us about the status or results of their respective efforts to seek additional patent protection. Therefore, information we report regarding the patent status of these partnered drug development programs is limited to our efforts to obtain patent protection.
In addition, we have several hundred additional patents and patent applications filed worldwide, substantially all of which pertain to our product development programs. Any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications would expire no earlier than 2023, excluding any patent term extension. These patents and patent applications disclose compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use and synthetic methods, as well as various salt and polymorphic forms of clinical candidates.
U.S. patents issued from applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, have a term of 20 years from the application filing date or earlier claimed priority. All of our patent applications were filed after June 8, 1995. Patents in most other countries have a term of 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application. Because the time from filing patent applications to issuance of patents is often several years, this process may result in a period of patent protection significantly shorter than 20 years, which may adversely affect our ability to exclude competitors from our markets. Currently, none of our patents covering drugs currently under development will expire prior to 2023. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patent coverage for these products and technologies. We intend to continue to file patent applications covering newly-developed products and technologies. We may not, however, commercialize the technology underlying any or all of our existing or future patent applications.

Patents provide some degree of protection for our proprietary technology. However, the pursuit and assertion of patent rights, particularly in areas like pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, involve complex legal and factual determinations and, therefore, are characterized by some uncertainty. In addition, the laws governing patentability and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve, particularly in biotechnology. As a result, patents may not be issued from any of our patent applications or from applications licensed to us. The scope of any of our patents, if issued, may not be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection. In addition, our patents or patents licensed to us, if they are issued, may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable so that our patent rights might not create an effective competitive barrier. Moreover, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Any patents issued to us or our strategic partners may not provide a legal basis for establishing an exclusive market for our products or provide us with any competitive advantages. Moreover, the patents held by others may adversely affect our ability to do business or to continue to use our technologies freely. In view of these factors, our intellectual property positions bear some degree of uncertainty.

The source code for our proprietary software programs is protected both as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work. We attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, third parties and consultants. Our employees also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in inventions, original expressions and any corresponding patents and copyrights arising from their work for us. However, it is possible that these agreements may be breached, invalidated or rendered unenforceable and if so, we may not have an adequate remedy available. Despite the measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property, parties to our agreements may breach the confidentiality provisions or infringe or misappropriate our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. In addition, third parties may independently discover or invent competing technologies or reverse-engineer our trade secrets or other technology. The failure of our employees, our consultants or third parties to maintain secrecy of our drug discovery and development efforts may compromise or prevent our ability to obtain patent coverage for our invention.
