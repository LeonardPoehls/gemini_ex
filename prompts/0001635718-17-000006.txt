ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Gannett Co., Inc. (Gannett, we, us, our, or the company) is a next-generation media company that empowers communities to connect, act, and thrive. Gannett owns ReachLocal, Inc. (ReachLocal), a digital marketing solutions company, the USA TODAY NETWORK (made up of USA TODAY including digital sites and affiliates (USAT) and 109 local media organizations in 34 states in the U.S. and Guam), and Newsquest (a wholly owned subsidiary operating in the United Kingdom (U.K.) with more than 160 local media brands). Through the USA TODAY NETWORK and Newsquest, Gannett delivers high-quality, trusted content where and when consumers want to engage with it on virtually any device or platform. Our content reaches more people digitally than Netflix, CBSnews.com, New York Times Digital, BuzzFeed.com, Huffington Post, or WashingtonPost.com according to comScore Media Metrics. The company reports in two operating segments, Publishing and ReachLocal, and a Corporate and Other category.
The company is the leading newspaper publisher in the U.S. in terms of circulation. Our comprehensive publishing operations also include commercial printing and distribution, marketing, and data services. Certain of our businesses have strategic relationships with online businesses currently controlled by our former parent, including CareerBuilder and cars.com. The company also reaches small and medium sized businesses with digital marketing solutions principally through ReachLocal, and to a lesser extent, a strategic relationship with a business unit of the company's former parent.
The company has made both internal and external digital investments to address consumers' changing habits towards consumption of news and information on digital devices and platforms and advertisers' changing spending habits towards digital products. In 2016, total digital revenues across the company were $778.9 million, of which 86% were derived from our publishing segment and 14% were derived from our ReachLocal segment. In 2016, the USA TODAY NETWORK, with more than 3,500 journalists, averaged approximately 110 million(a) (see "References" section below) monthly unique visitors who access content through desktops, smartphones and tablets. In November 2016, the company achieved a record of 122 million(a) unique digital visitors in the U.S. To date, there have been more than 23.3 million(b) downloads of USA TODAY's award-winning app on mobile devices and 4.4 million(b) downloads of apps associated with our local publications. Of the total U.S. digital millennial audience (18-34), 50%(a) access USA TODAY NETWORK content. In the U.K., Newsquest is a publishing and digital leader where its network of web sites attracts over 25 million(c) unique visitors monthly.
Publishing Segment
Our publishing segment (a description of our segments is included in Note 14 â€” Segment reporting of the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements) comprises the USA TODAY NETWORK (as described above) and Newsquest. USA TODAY has been a cornerstone of the national news landscape for more than three decades. Since its introduction in 1982, USA TODAY has developed a recognizable and respected brand that we leverage across various businesses. For example, USA TODAY Sports Media Group has used the USA TODAY brand name to successfully launch "For the Win" (ftw.usatoday.com), a unique digital property that provides sports fans with social news and curated analysis. We believe the USA TODAY brand boosts the credibility of affiliated properties, enabling tailored content platforms to increase their audience. As a result, we include as an insert each day in 36 of our local daily publications the USA TODAY local edition, which includes News, Money and Life content, while sports coverage is integrated into local sports sections. USA TODAY is currently the nation's No. 1 newspaper in consolidated print and digital circulation according to the Alliance for Audited Media's September 2016 Publisher's Statement, with total daily circulation of 3.6 million and Sunday circulation of 3.4 million, which includes daily print, digital replica, digital non-replica, and branded editions. 
In the U.K., our wholly-owned subsidiary Newsquest has a total average readership of over 5.5 million every week. We believe that the availability of our award-winning content to audiences whenever, wherever, and however they choose makes Newsquest a go-to information source for consumers and preferred platform for advertisers in all industries, sizes, and locations. Newsquest's digital audience increased substantially during 2016, with audited average daily unique users rising by 20%(c) year over year. 
We generate revenue primarily through both print and digital advertising and subscriptions to our publications. USA TODAY and our local publications have developed an efficient operating model utilizing integrated shared support for back-office operations such as financial services and accounting, design and layout services, and certain sales and service platforms. This model also serves as a point of leverage and synergy opportunity with respect to businesses acquired by the company. (See Strategy section.)

Our U.S. local publishing circulation revenue is driven through our All Access Content Subscription Model. All subscriptions include access to content via multiple platforms including websites, smartphone and tablet applications, and e-newspapers, with subscription prices that vary according to the frequency of delivery of the print edition. Also available to subscribers are digital only or digital plus Sunday subscriptions. In addition to the subscription model, single-copy print editions continue to be sold at retail outlets and account for approximately 12% of daily and 21% of Sunday net paid and verified circulation volume. The majority of net paid circulation results of USA TODAY are generated by single-copy sales at newsstands, vending machines, or hotels that provide copies to their guests. The remainder is generated by home and office delivery, mail, educational, and other sales. At Newsquest, revenues from circulation and advertising are generated from 94 daily or weekly paid-for publications as well as 77 free publications, whereas circulation revenues are from paid subscriptions.
Advertising: In 2016, publishing segment advertising revenues of $1.6 billion comprised 55% of total publishing segment revenues. We have experienced advertising departments that sell retail, classified, and national advertising across multiple platforms including print, online, mobile, and tablet as well as niche publications. We have a national advertising sales force focused on the largest national advertisers and a separate sales organization to support classified employment sales: the Digital Employment Sales Center. We also have relationships with outside agencies that specialize in the sale of national ads.
Our revenues are subject to moderate seasonality due primarily to fluctuations in advertising volumes. Our advertising revenues for publishing are typically highest in the company's fourth quarter due to holiday and seasonal advertising and lowest in the first quarter following the holiday season. The volume of advertising sales in any period is also impacted by other external factors such as competitors' pricing, advertisers' decisions to increase or decrease their advertising expenditures in response to anticipated consumer demand, and general economic conditions.
The company employs a multi-platform approach to advertising sales, which can be specifically tailored to the individual needs of many levels of advertisers from small, locally-owned merchants to large, complex businesses. In addition to print, we offer our advertising clients multiple platforms and products including display advertising, desktop, mobile, tablet, and other specialty publications. Our diverse sales force, unique industry scale, and broad portfolio of print and digital products position us to attract and serve a wide array of advertising partners. We continue to enjoy a long-standing relationship of trust in our local business communities. Our advertising sales staff delivers solutions for our customers. Our digital marketing services provide localized marketing solutions to national and small to medium-sized businesses, helping them navigate the increasingly complex and diverse world of digital marketing.
Social media, mobile and video are all important contributors to the success of our digital advertising revenue growth. In the U.S., mobile page views increased 25%(c) and mobile visitors increased 7%(c) in 2016 on a year-over-year basis. In December, the USA TODAY NETWORK ranked #1 in mobile web unique digital visitors in the news and information category. The USA TODAY NETWORK, with 1.7 billion(c) page views, ranked #3(c) in page views led by our 25%(c) growth in mobile web page views year over year. Gannett continues to build an innovative video network, with best-in-class video content to attract new audiences and drive revenue growth through enhancing existing revenue streams and creating new innovative products. In December 2016, we generated 113 million(d) cross-platform video plays, an increase of 53%(d) year over year. The company implemented a social media content management software tool to allow our journalists and marketing and customer service teams to more effectively manage multiple social media profiles and significantly increase their responsiveness and engagement with consumers. Recently, the USA TODAY NETWORK ranked #3(a) in the news and information category with respect to Facebook fans.
In 2016, Gannett introduced VRtually There, an extension of the USA TODAY NETWORK's innovative and pioneering work in virtual reality (VR) that enables the NETWORK's journalists to tell the nation's stories and deliver immersive and original content in VR to our 110(a) million unique monthly users. VRtually There provides new advertising opportunities for brand partners with the introduction of the "cubemercial." The "cubemercial" is a NETWORK VR advertising innovation that showcases our industry-leading VR advertising that works seamlessly within the program, which we believe, has set the advertising standard for VR. 
We sell and track our advertising sales in three primary categories:

â€¢ | Retail advertising is associated with local merchants or locally owned businesses. Retail includes regional and national chains (such as department and grocery stores) that sell in the local market.


â€¢ | National advertising is principally from advertisers who are promoting national products or brands. Examples are pharmaceuticals, travel, airlines, or packaged goods. Both retail and national ads also include preprints, typically stand-alone multiple page fliers that are inserted in the daily and Sunday print product.

4


â€¢ | Classified advertising includes the major categories of automotive, employment, legal, and real estate/rentals. Advertising for classified segments is published in the classified sections or other sections within the publication, on affiliated digital platforms, and certain magazines.

We believe local and national advertisers find it challenging to manage the complexity of their marketing investments, particularly digital solutions. They are seeking to reach an increasingly elusive audience and are struggling to influence attitudes and behavior at each stage of the purchase path. To help advertisers solve this problem, we created a refined approach to media planning to present advertisers with targeted, integrated solutions. The planning process leverages our considerable strength in data analysis and secondary research. The result is a tailored media/marketing plan where the individual elements work in concert to amplify and reinforce advertisers' messages and solve their business needs.
Our consultative multi-media sales approach can be tailored to all levels of advertisers, from small, locally owned merchants to large, complex businesses. Along with this sales approach, we have intense sales and management training programs. Digital product integration, sales pipeline management and a five-step consultative sales process continue to be focus areas, with formal training being delivered in all company markets. Front-line sales managers in all markets participate in intensive training to help them coach their sales executives for top performance.
Circulation: In 2016, publishing segment circulation revenues of $1.1 billion comprised 39% of total publishing segment revenues. We deliver content in print and online via desktops, mobile devices and tablets. For local U.S. publications, our All Access Content Subscription Model has more than 1.6 million digitally activated subscribers, providing easy access to content-rich products. In a trend generally consistent within the domestic publishing industry, print circulation volume declined in 2016. At Newsquest, we publish 19 daily paid-for titles and 75 weekly paid-for titles as well as 77 free publications.
EZ Pay, a payment system which automatically deducts subscription payments from customers' credit cards or bank accounts, enhances the subscriber retention rate. At the end of 2016, EZ Pay was used by 63% of all subscribers at local U.S. Gannett sites (not including USA TODAY). Mail subscriptions are available nationwide and abroad, and home, hotel, and office delivery is available in many markets. Approximately 81% of USA TODAY net paid circulation results are generated by single-copy sales at newsstands, vending machines, or to hotels that provide them to their guests. The remainder is generated by home and office delivery, mail, educational, and other sales. In the U.S local markets, approximately 80% of circulation revenue is derived from full-access including digital-only subscriptions, while 20% is derived from single copy and other sources. Newsquest employs a regional model, generally involving the clustering of the publication of a free print product alongside a paid-for print product, which allows for this cross-selling of advertising serving the same or contiguous markets, satisfying the needs of its advertisers and audiences.
Production and Distribution: Gannett Publishing Services (GPS) was formed to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost associated with the production and distribution of the Gannett printed products across all divisions in the U.S. GPS manages the production and circulation operations for all of our local daily and non-daily newspapers and USA TODAY.
GPS leverages our existing assets, including employee talent and experience, physical plants and equipment, and our vast national and local distribution networks. GPS is responsible for imaging, advertising production, internal and external printing, packaging, and distribution. Over the last several years, GPS has actively outsourced printing activities to competitive local market or regional printing businesses in situations where the cost to outsource would benefit Gannett. Alternatively, in certain cases, GPS will utilize excess printing capacity to print competitor and other publications.
Almost all U.S. local publications and USA TODAY employees utilize a common content management system. The common content management system enables the communication and collaboration needed to share content and to build strong page layout and design remotely. Our five design studios provide design services to all our local publications by enhancing operating efficiencies and the page design quality of our publications.
Newsquest operates its publishing activities around regional centers to maximize the use of management, finance, printing, and personnel resources. This regional approach allows the business to leverage a variety of back-office and administrative activities to optimize financial results and enables the group to offer readers and advertisers a range of attractive products across the market.
Competition: Our U.S. publishing operations and affiliated digital platforms compete with other media and digital companies for advertising and marketing spend. Publishing operations also compete for circulation and readership against other news and information outlets and amateur content creators. While very few of our publishing operations have similar daily print competitors that are published in the same city, our print products compete with smaller suburban area newspapers, free or 
5

paid publications, and other media including magazines, television, direct mail, cable television, radio, outdoor advertising, directories, e-mail marketing, web sites, and mobile-device platforms. Newsquest's publishing operations are focused on hyper-local markets. Their principal competitors include other regional and national newspaper and magazine publishers, other advertising media such as broadcast and billboard, Internet-based news, radio, television and other information and communication businesses.
Development of opportunities in, and competition from, digital media, including web sites, tablet, and mobile products continues to increase. As such, there is very little barrier to entry and limited capital requirements for new companies to enter the market with competitive digital products. The company will continue to expand its reach through internal development, content distribution programs, acquisitions and partnerships, in the news, information and communications business, and through audience generation, in an effort to protect its market share.
Environmental Regulation: The company is committed to protecting the environment. Our goal is to ensure our facilities comply with federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and to incorporate appropriate environmental practices and standards in its operations. We are one of the industry leaders in the use of recycled newsprint. During 2016, 19% of our domestic newsprint purchases contained recycled content, with an average recycled content of 32%. 
Our operations use inks, solvents, and fuels. The use, management and disposal of these substances are sometimes regulated by environmental agencies. We retain a corporate environmental consultant who, along with internal and outside counsel, oversees regulatory compliance and preventive measures. Some of our subsidiaries have been included among the potentially responsible parties in connection with sites that have been identified as possibly requiring environmental remediation although we do not currently anticipate these designations will have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.
Raw Materials: Newsprint, which is the basic raw material used in our print publications, has been and may continue to be subject to significant price changes from time to time. We purchase newsprint primarily from 12 domestic and global suppliers. During 2016, our total newsprint consumption was approximately 294,000 metric tons, including consumption by USA TODAY NETWORK, tonnage at non-Gannett print sites, and Newsquest. Newsprint consumption in 2016 was 7% less than in 2015. On a pro-forma basis without tonnage from businesses acquired during 2016, newsprint consumption was 21% lower compared to 2015. We continue to moderate newsprint consumption and expense through the use of lighter basis weight paper. We believe available sources of newsprint, together with present inventories, will continue to be adequate to supply the needs of our publishing operations.
Joint Operating Agencies: Our publishing subsidiary in Detroit participates in a joint operating agency (JOA). The JOA performs the production, sales, and distribution functions for the subsidiary and another publishing company under a joint operating agreement. Operating results for the Detroit JOA are fully consolidated along with a charge for the minority partner's share of profits.
ReachLocal Segment
ReachLocal's mission is to provide more customers to local businesses. ReachLocal, which began in 2004 and was acquired by Gannett in 2016, helps local businesses advertise online. ReachLocal's focus is on local businesses and believes local businesses want a single, unified solution to their marketing needs. As such, ReachLocal's goal is to provide a total digital marketing solution that will address local business's online marketing needs. ReachLocal's total digital marketing solution consists of products and solutions in three categories: digital advertising (including ReachSearchâ„¢, ReachDisplayâ„¢, ReachSocial Adsâ„¢, and ReachRetargetingâ„¢), web presence (including ReachSite+ReachEdgeâ„¢, ReachSEOâ„¢, ReachCastâ„¢, ReachListingsâ„¢, and TotalLiveChatâ„¢), and software-as-a-service (ReachEdgeâ„¢ and Kickservâ„¢).
Products: ReachLocal's search engine marketing (SEM) solution, ReachSearchâ„¢, combines search engine marketing optimized across multiple publishers, call tracking and call recording services, and industry leading campaign performance transparency. ReachSearchâ„¢ remains a leading SEM offering for local businesses and has won numerous awards since its rollout, including most recently winning Google's Quality Score Champion Award in North America. ReachSearchâ„¢ is optimized for local markets in each of ReachLocal's territories. ReachSearchâ„¢ accounted for 83% of ReachLocal's segment revenue for the year ended December 25, 2016. 
ReachLocal also offers online advertising products focused on maximizing local businesses exposure by displaying their ads on websites that, in the aggregate, reach an estimated 90% of the U.S. online audience. ReachLocal's display products include a retargeting solution to target consumers who have previously visited a specific client's website, either through a ReachSearchâ„¢ campaign or a ReachDisplayâ„¢ campaign, or who have previously searched for a client's keywords (ReachRetargetingâ„¢) and a 
6

Facebook advertising solution (ReachSocial Adsâ„¢), among other products. These products are generally available in North America and selectively available in ReachLocal's international markets.
ReachLocal offers a number of web presence solutions. These solutions include websites (ReachSiteâ„¢), search engine optimization (ReachSEOâ„¢), social (ReachCastâ„¢), chat (TotalLiveChatâ„¢), listings (ReachListingsâ„¢), and other products and solutions, all focused on expanding and leveraging clients' web presence. Often, these products are designed to work in concert with ReachLocal's digital advertising products with a goal of enhancing client's return on investment. These products are generally available in North America and selectively available in ReachLocal's international markets.
ReachLocal also offers software products designed to enable its clients to both easily assess the efficacy of their marketing efforts and to facilitate their interactions with their customers. ReachLocal's ReachEdgeâ„¢ solution is a marketing automation platform that includes tools for capturing web traffic information and converting leads into new customers for clients. ReachEdgeâ„¢ provides clients with tools designed to significantly improve their conversion of leads to customers and also helps the client stay top-of-mind during the prospect's decision-making process by using integrated marketing automation to send new prospects targeted e-mails and alerts to the client's staff reminding them to follow up on each lead. ReachEdgeâ„¢ also provides reports to show clients how many leads they are getting from each marketing source and other important business insights. ReachEdgeâ„¢ is available in most of ReachLocal's markets. ReachLocal's Kickservâ„¢ solution is a cloud-based business management software for service businesses. Kickservâ„¢ allows ReachLocal to provide an end-to-end solution to clients that starts with lead generation (e.g., ReachSearchâ„¢, ReachDisplayâ„¢, and ReachSEOâ„¢), includes lead conversion (ReachEdgeâ„¢), and then closes and manages the business relationship (Kickservâ„¢). Kickservâ„¢ is available in North America.
Distribution: ReachLocal delivers its suite of products and solutions to local businesses through a combination of its proprietary technology platform, its sales force, and select third-party agencies and resellers. ReachLocal has sales operations in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Brazil, and Mexico. Approximately 73% of revenues are derived in North America and the remaining 27% from other international markets. All (100%) of ReachLocal revenues are digital revenues.
Competition: The market for local online advertising solutions is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. The market is highly fragmented as there are a number of smaller companies which provide internet marketing services at highly competitive prices and, increasingly, ReachLocal competes with vertical-specific SMB marketing providers who offer solutions tailored for specific verticals. In addition, the online publishers that ReachLocal utilizes for its clients, such as Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft, generally offer their products and services through self-service platforms. Many traditional, offline media companies also offer online advertising solutions and have large, direct sales forces and digital publishing properties. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, ReachLocal expects competition to intensify in the future.
Strategy
We are committed to a business strategy that generates returns for shareholders, delights audiences through a robust user experience, and engages with consumers to strengthen the brands of advertising partners and drive company revenue. Key elements of our strategy to achieve these objectives are as follows:
Supplement organic growth with selective acquisitions. We believe we are well-positioned to pursue value-enhancing investments and acquisitions and intend to be both opportunistic and disciplined in our acquisition strategy. We believe our balance sheet and cash flow generation remain strong in comparison to peers, providing us with the financial flexibility to pursue opportunities arising in a consolidating industry. We are an efficient operator, and our strengths in information gathering and reporting, coupled with our valuable integrated content sharing, advertising, sales, and administrative platforms, will yield innovative approaches to revenue generation as well as efficiency gains in acquired properties. By leveraging these efficiencies and operational expertise to those publishing assets acquired, the company is able to achieve greater synergies, particularly through the consolidation of printing and distribution activities. 
Within the digital space, local small to medium-sized business relationships developed over the years in the company's local markets is a valuable asset. As an example, the challenge faced by ReachLocal in recent years was scaling up the number of new local business leads it generated. The cost of acquisition was simply too high as a standalone company. Now as a subsidiary of Gannett that will change. Through its portfolio of news sites across the USA TODAY NETWORK and the U.K., Gannett has trusted relationships with hundreds of thousands of local advertising customers. ReachLocal will be able to leverage that customer base to scale ReachLocal's digital marketing services portfolio and provide Gannett customers with complete advertising and marketing solution.
7

Maintain a strong, flexible balance sheet. Through proactive cost management and disciplined financial policies, we remain committed to maintaining financial flexibility in order to execute our organic growth strategies and be in position to make accretive acquisitions.
Focus on capital allocation. Our approach to capital allocation is a key source of financial strength in support of current initiatives and also provides flexibility to return cash to shareholders. In July 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a three-year, $150 million share repurchase program. As of December 25, 2016, 3.75 million shares have been repurchased under this program at an average cost of $8.71 per share.
In addition, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.16 in each quarter of 2016, allowing us to provide strong return to shareholders concurrently with our growth and expansion efforts.
Continue to enhance digital platforms. As the news and information industry has evolved and readers increasingly consume content on digital platforms, we have made and will continue to make significant investments in online and mobile offerings across both local and national markets. We intend to continue to develop compelling content and ensure readers can access their trusted local and national news and information sources on every platform. The credibility and trust of our news brands carries over to digital platforms and differentiates our online products from digital competitors. We also plan to focus on continuing to develop a compelling mobile experience, including video and VR content, across our network.
Expand the integration of national and local content. In 2016, we continued our transformation into one, integrated organization as we united our local and national media brands under the USA TODAY NETWORK to create the largest local to national media network in the country. The network provides the opportunity for advertisers to scale their messages from hyper-local to national while reaching millions of consumers through a variety of platforms. Gannett will continue to invest in growing the USA TODAY NETWORK to include more local markets and new and engaging platforms.
Focus on operational excellence. While maintaining a commitment to quality journalism, we will continue to maximize the efficiency of our print, sales, administrative, and distribution functions to increase profitability. This efficiency has been accomplished through the consolidation of certain back-office, administrative and operating activities into centers of excellence related primarily to financial services and accounting, layout and design and printing and distribution. We will continue to leverage our economies of scale to reduce supply chain costs, provide significant shared editorial content, and streamline our creative and design interactions with advertisers in print and online. We believe these efforts will enable us to increase profitability and strengthen customer relationships.
Strategic Acquisitions
ReachLocal, Inc. (ReachLocal): In August 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of ReachLocal, Inc. for approximately $162.5 million in cash, net of cash acquired. We financed the transaction by borrowing $175.0 million under our credit facility as well as with available cash.
North Jersey Media Group, Inc. (NJMG): In July 2016, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of North Jersey Media Group, Inc. for approximately $39.3 million. NJMG is a media company with print and digital publishing operations serving primarily the northern New Jersey market. Its brands include such established names as The Record (Bergen County) and The Herald. We financed the transaction with available cash.
Journal Media Group, Inc. (JMG): In April 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Journal Media Group, Inc. for approximately $260.6 million in cash, net of cash acquired. We financed the transaction by borrowing $250.0 million under our credit facility as well as with available cash. JMG is a media company with print and digital publishing operations serving 15 U.S. markets in nine states, including the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the Knoxville News Sentinel, and The Commercial Appeal in Memphis.

Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership (TNP): In June 2015, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 59.4% interest in the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership that we did not own. The deal was completed through the assignment of our interest in the California Newspapers Partnership (CNP) and additional cash consideration, resulting in a pretax gain on our equity investment of $21.8 million. As a result, we own 100% of TNP and no longer have any ownership interest in CNP. The acquisition added one news organization in Texas, six in New Mexico, and four in Pennsylvania. 
8

Romanes Media Group (RMG): In May 2015, we acquired the Romanes Media Group located in the U.K. Romanes includes one daily and 28 weekly publications and their associated digital platforms. The transaction was completed by our subsidiary, Newsquest.
History
Our newspaper business was founded by Frank E. Gannett and associates in 1906 and incorporated in 1923. We were separated from our former parent on June 29, 2015 when our former parent distributed 98.5% of the outstanding shares of Gannett common stock (also referred to herein as the spin-off or separation) to its stockholders on a pro rata basis. Following the distribution, our former parent owns 1.5% of Gannett's outstanding common stock and will continue to own our shares for a period of time not to exceed five years after the distribution. We are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol GCI and are headquartered in McLean, VA near Washington, DC.
Employees
We employed approximately 17,100 persons at our subsidiaries in the U.S. as of December 25, 2016. Approximately 13% of those employed by us and our subsidiaries in the U.S. are represented by labor unions, most of which are affiliated with of one of seven international unions. These represented employees are covered by approximately 60 collective bargaining agreements. These agreements conform generally with the pattern of labor agreements in the publishing industry. We do not engage in industry-wide or company-wide bargaining. Our U.K. subsidiaries bargain with two unions over working practices, wages, and health and safety issues only. Approximately 3,200 persons are employed by Newsquest in the U.K, and there are a total of approximately 3,900 employees outside of the U.S.
