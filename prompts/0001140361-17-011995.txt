General
 
ASB Bancorp, Inc. – ASB Bancorp, Inc. (“ASB Bancorp” or the “Company”), a North Carolina corporation, was incorporated in May 2011 to be the holding company for Asheville Savings Bank (“Asheville Savings” or the “Bank”) upon the completion of the Bank’s conversion from the mutual to the stock form of ownership on October 11, 2011. Before the completion of the conversion, the Company did not engage in any significant activities other than organizational activities. The Company’s principal business activity is the ownership of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Bank. The Company does not own or lease any real property, but instead uses the premises, equipment and other property of the Bank, with the payment of appropriate rental fees, as required by applicable laws and regulations, under the terms of an expense allocation agreement entered into with the Bank. The Company and the Bank also entered into an income tax allocation agreement that provides for the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return and formalizes procedures for the payment and allocation of federal income taxes between the Company and the Bank.
Asheville Savings Bank – Founded in 1936, the Bank is a North Carolina chartered savings bank headquartered in Asheville, North Carolina. We operate as a community-oriented financial institution offering traditional financial services to consumers and businesses in our primary market area. We attract deposits from the general public and use those funds to originate primarily one-to-four family residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans, and, to a lesser extent, home equity loans and lines of credit, consumer loans, construction and land development loans, and commercial and industrial loans. We conduct our lending and deposit activities primarily with individuals and small businesses in our primary market area.
 
Our primary market area is Asheville, North Carolina and the rest of Buncombe County where we have eight branch offices, as well as Henderson, Madison, McDowell and Transylvania Counties where we have five branch offices.

Operating Strategy
 
Our primary objective is to operate and grow a profitable community-oriented financial institution serving customers in our primary market areas. We seek to achieve this through the adoption of a business strategy to provide superior financial services with honesty and integrity to help our customers and communities prosper by focusing on our core values while achieving sustainable profitability and reasonable returns to our shareholders. We plan to continue our focus on loan growth in 2017.  We employ senior management with substantial experience in consumer and commercial banking to help us diversify our product offerings and expand our consumer and commercial deposit and lending products, while maintaining high asset quality standards. Our operating strategies include the following:

• | profitable growth of our commercial and small business relationships;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | profitable growth of our residential mortgage banking;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | increase efficiencies and productivity bank wide; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | cultivate a culture of accountability bank wide.
--+-------------------------------------------------



Profitable growth of our commercial and small business relationships.
 
Our goal is to grow the number and profitability of business relationships across all product lines, which include loans, deposits, cash management/treasury services, payments, investments/wealth management, residential mortgage and non-bank solutions.  This will necessitate a more focused approach to identifying and targeting specific niches/customer segments.  We will gain a better understanding of products, services, and delivery our target customers value, determination of gaps in our offering, and a plan to close those gaps.  We will attain a better alignment of organization structure, talent, delivery, processes, procedures and technology in addition to marketing strategies to promote growth.
 
Profitable growth of our residential mortgage banking.
 
Residential mortgage lending remains an important part of our lending activities. We originate fixed and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans that are retained in our loan portfolio. However, most of the fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate are sold into the secondary market with servicing released as part of our efforts to reduce our interest rate risk. At December 31, 2016, residential mortgage loans totaled $200.6 million, or 33.2% of our total loan portfolio. Increasing the volume and profitability of single family residential mortgages originated and closed will necessitate an alignment of the Bank’s mortgage banking business model in support of growth goals including: people (talent and leadership), products, processes, acquisition relationships, technology, and back office operations in addition to marketing strategies to promote growth.

Increase efficiencies and productivity bank wide.
 
We seek to increase our profitability by improving efficiencies and productivity throughout the Bank.  This necessitates right-sizing the Bank’s cost structure for revenue growth by allocating resources in alignment with our strategic priorities.  This will require a laser-like focus that must be embedded in the culture of the Bank, having infrastructure, processes, procedures, technology and the like that makes it easier, simpler, faster and less expensive to conduct business.  We will continue to monitor and evaluate the Bank’s processes, policies, and technology to make it easy for the customer to do business with the Bank – simpler, faster and easier.  This includes facilitating our teams’ abilities to recognize opportunities, delivering on commitments to customers and aligning our overall cost structure with our operating revenues.
 
Cultivate a culture of accountability bank wide.
 
We will continue to create a work environment in which employees are engaged and committed to the vision of the Bank and encouraged and rewarded for performing at their highest potential.  This requires a strong performance management program that provides clear direction and expectations to all employees and focuses on performance, empowering employees to take responsibility that is aligned with our core values. We hold employees accountable for performance and we provide career and professional development opportunities for them.
 
Market Area
 
We are headquartered in Asheville, North Carolina, which is the county seat of Buncombe County, North Carolina and consider Buncombe, Madison, McDowell, Henderson and Transylvania Counties in Western North Carolina and the surrounding areas to be our primary market area. Asheville is situated in the Blue Ridge Mountains at the confluence of the Swannanoa River and French Broad River and is known for its natural beauty and scenic surroundings. The nearby Great Smoky Mountains National Park and Blue Ridge Parkway are among the more visited parks in the United States. In addition, the Asheville metropolitan area has a vibrant cultural and arts community that parallels that of many larger cities in the United States. It has been referred to as the “Paris of the South,” and The New York Times calls it a “surprisingly cosmopolitan city.”  It is a place that combines local arts and diversity of a city with a friendly, small town feel. Asheville is home to a number of historical attractions, the most prominent of which is the Biltmore Estate, a historic mansion with gardens and the most visited winery in the nation, drawing more than one million tourists each year.  Due to its scenic location and diverse cultural and historical offerings, the Asheville metropolitan area has become a popular destination for tourists, attracting approximately nine million visitors annually, with a direct economic impact of approximately $1.5 billion to our local economy. In addition, affordable housing prices, combined with the region’s favorable climate, scenic surroundings and cultural attractions, have also made the Asheville metropolitan area an increasingly attractive destination for retirees seeking to relocate from other parts of the United States.  In Spring 2016, Southern Business & Development ranked Asheville among the top three “Best Mid-Markets in the South to Relocate Your Headquarters.” The Asheville area was also ranked as the 23rd “Best Overall Area in the United States for Women Entrepreneurs” by GoodCall, and in May 2016 was ranked 3rd out of 18 of the “World’s Best Cities for Millennials” by Matador.  In February 2015, Top Retirements named the area as number one on the 2015 list of “Best Places to Retire,” noting Asheville’s reputation as a great place to retire makes it the standard that all other retirement towns can aspire to be.  Forbes ranked Asheville 40th for the 2016 rankings of U.S. cities as “Best Places for Business and Careers.”  Originally established as a mountain retreat, Asheville now stands as a hub for technology, business innovation and growth, making it an attractive destination for corporate relocation.

The Asheville metropolitan area benefits from a diverse economy, and there is no single employer or industry upon which a significant number of our customers are dependent.  The area has a mix of manufacturing including advanced manufacturing, plastics, metals, textiles, furniture and automotive parts. Agriculture including food processing is a growing segment of the local economy.  Wood product businesses also are prevalent in Western North Carolina.  Biopharmaceutical is also a growing segment of our economy with Jacob Holm and others having a presence in Asheville.  Business services are predominant in the area with financial services, insurance, financial advisors and other professional practices making up a growing and steady part of the economy.  IT/Software is emerging in our economy as well as other Knowledge Based businesses that are attracted to the area due to quality of life and available resources. Asheville is home to more than 16 climate services organizations and the headquarters of National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), the world’s largest archive of weather and climate data center of worldwide communication about climate change. The travel and tourism industry as well as entertainment, including performing arts, sports and film production continue to add economic value to the area.  Western North Carolina has a number of manufacturing and technology companies located in the area, including Wilsonart International, Inc., Eaton Corporation, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Plasticard-Locktech International and Arvato Digital Services.  GE Aviation, Linamar Corporation, White Labs Inc., Hi-Wire Brewing, Highland Brewing Company, Wicked Weed Brewing and BorgWarner Inc. are among the companies that expanded in the Asheville area during 2014 and 2015.  Newer industries that moved to the area include American Recycling and brewers New Belgium, Sierra Nevada and Oskar Blues Brewery. The larger breweries and some successful local micro-breweries have spawned new opportunities in the region, which has created jobs and additional exposure for the area.  During 2016, Avadim Technologies, Baldor Electric Company and Burial Beer Co. were among the businesses expanding their facilities in the Asheville area. Furthermore, the region is home to a number of educational organizations, private colleges and large public universities, such as the University of North Carolina at Asheville as well as satellite campuses of Lenoir-Rhyne University, North Carolina State University and Western Carolina University. Mission Health System, a leading employer in the Asheville metropolitan area and the state’s sixth largest health system, has been nationally recognized as one of the nation’s Top 15 Health Systems 2012-2015, the only health system in the nation to receive this recognition four years in a row, and the only health system in North Carolina to achieve Top 15 recognition, and also received the 2016 Culture of Excellence Award.  Mission Health has seven Centers of Excellence:  Cancer, Heart, Mission Children’s Hospital, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, Trauma and Women’s Health.
 
Over the course of the past year, the tourism industry in the Asheville metropolitan area has improved, which has positively impacted the economy in a number of our local markets, such as Buncombe and Henderson counties, that directly benefit from this industry.  The overall unemployment rate in the Asheville metropolitan area, the lowest in North Carolina, decreased to 4.0% in December 2016 from 4.2% in December 2015, according to statistics published by the State of North Carolina Department of Commerce. Buncombe County also had the lowest county unemployment rate in North Carolina for December 2016 at 3.7%, and for comparative purposes, the reported seasonally adjusted unemployment rates were 5.1% for North Carolina and 4.7% for the United States for December 2016. The Company also considers McDowell County and Transylvania County, which are not included in the unemployment statistics for the Asheville metropolitan area, as part of its primary market area. The December 2016 unemployment rates were 4.6% for McDowell County and 4.9% for Transylvania County according to the State of North Carolina Department of Commerce.
 
Competition
 
We face significant competition for the attraction of deposits and origination of loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from several financial institutions operating in our primary market area and from other financial service companies such as securities brokerage firms, credit unions and insurance companies. We also face competition for investors’ funds from money market funds, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. At June 30, 2016, which is the most recent date for which deposit market share data is available from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, we held approximately 9.96% of the deposits in Buncombe County, North Carolina, 3.31% of the deposits in
 
 5
 

Henderson County, North Carolina, 23.79% of the deposits in Madison County, North Carolina, 17.86% of the deposits in McDowell County, North Carolina and 4.57% of the deposits in Transylvania County, North Carolina. This data does not reflect deposits held by credit unions with which we also compete. In addition, banks owned by large national and regional holding companies and other community-based banks also operate in our primary market area. Some of these institutions are larger than us and, therefore, have greater resources.
 
Our competition for loans comes primarily from financial institutions, including credit unions, in our primary market area and from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies, mortgage brokers and private investors. Competition for loans also comes from non-depository financial service companies entering the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies and specialty finance companies.
 
We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet, and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our growth in the future.
 
Lending Activities
 
General. The largest component of our loan portfolio is real estate mortgage loans, primarily one-to-four family residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans, and to a lesser extent, revolving mortgage loans (which consist of home equity loans and lines of credit), consumer loans, construction and land development loans, and commercial and industrial loans. We originate loans for investment purposes, although we generally sell our fixed-rate residential mortgage loans into the secondary market with servicing released.
 
We intend to continue to emphasize residential and commercial mortgage lending, while also concentrating on ways to expand our commercial and industrial lending activities with a focus on serving small businesses and emphasizing relationship banking in our primary market area. We do not offer Alt-A, sub-prime or no-documentation mortgage loans.
 
One-to-Four Family Residential Loans. At December 31, 2016, we had $200.6 million in one-to-four and multi-family residential loans, which represented 33.2% of our total loan portfolio, of which $200.0 million were performing in accordance with their original terms. Our origination of residential mortgage loans enables borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes located in our primary market area.
 
Our residential lending policies and procedures conform to the secondary market guidelines. We offer a mix of adjustable rate mortgage loans and fixed-rate mortgage loans with terms of up to 30 years. Borrower demand for adjustable-rate loans compared to fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, and the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans as compared to an initially discounted interest rate and loan fees for multi-year adjustable-rate mortgages. The relative amount of fixed-rate mortgage loans and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment. We sell most of the fixed-rate mortgages we originate, which reduces our balances of adjustable rate mortgages as they are refinanced into fixed-rate mortgages during periods of low interest rates. We determine the loan fees, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans based on our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions.

Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate mortgage loans adjust at intervals of one to five years after an initial fixed period that ranges from one to ten years. Interest rates on our adjustable-rate loans generally are indexed to the US Treasury Constant Maturity Index for the applicable periods. However, in some limited situations, these loans are indexed to the one year London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”).
 
While one-to-four family residential real estate loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full either upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans on a regular basis. We do not offer residential mortgage loans with negative amortization and we currently offer marketable interest-only residential mortgage loans to well qualified borrowers in limited situations.
 
We do not make owner occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 95%, unless the loan is federally guaranteed. Loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% typically require private mortgage insurance. In addition, we do not make non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 85% unless we are able to sell the loan on the secondary market. We require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by a board-approved independent appraiser. We also require title insurance on all mortgage loans. Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance, and flood insurance is required for all loans located in flood hazard areas.
 
At December 31, 2016, our largest residential mortgage loan had an outstanding balance of $3.0 million and was performing in accordance with its original terms.
 
Commercial Mortgage Loans. We offer fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans secured by non-residential real estate, which we refer to as commercial mortgage loans. At December 31, 2016, commercial mortgage loans totaled $241.1 million, or 39.9% of our total loan portfolio, all of which were performing in accordance with their terms. Our commercial mortgage loans are generally secured by commercial, industrial, manufacturing, small to moderately-sized office, retail, hotel, hospital and church properties located in our primary market area. Although we have historically made commercial mortgage loans that are secured by both owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied properties, we continue to emphasize the origination of commercial mortgage loans that are secured by owner-occupied properties. At December 31, 2016, $76.8 million, or 31.9%, of our commercial real estate loans were secured by owner-occupied properties.
 
We originate fixed-rate and adjustable-rate commercial mortgage loans, generally with terms of three to five years and payments based on an amortization schedule of up to 30 years, resulting in “balloon” balances at maturity. For our adjustable-rate commercial mortgage loans, interest rates are typically equal either to the prime lending rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal or to LIBOR, plus an applicable margin. Depending upon the interest rate cycle, our adjustable-rate commercial mortgage loans typically provide for interest rate floors. Loans are secured by first mortgages, generally are originated with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 85% and may require specified debt service coverage ratios depending on the characteristics of the project. Rates and other terms on such loans generally depend on our assessment of credit risk after considering such factors as the borrower’s financial condition, credit history, loan-to-value ratio, debt service coverage ratio and other factors, including whether the property securing the loan will be owner occupied.
 
At December 31, 2016, our largest commercial mortgage loan relationship consisted of ten loans and one line of credit to five different entities. The loans have personal guarantees from the owners and are secured by nine separate income producing commercial rental properties. The collateral properties range from office and retail to industrial warehouse located in Asheville, North Carolina with a total outstanding balance of $10.6 million.  The loans are performing in accordance to their original loan terms.

Construction and Land Development Loans. We have originated construction and land development loans for commercial properties, such as retail shops and office units, and multi-family properties. At December 31, 2016, commercial construction and land development loans totaled $27.8 million, which represented 4.6% of our total loan portfolio, all of which were performing in accordance with their terms. Typically commercial construction loans are for a term of 12 to 24 months with interest payable monthly and are generally followed by a permanent loan with monthly principal and interest payments.  Commercial construction loans generally require a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% and land development loans generally require a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75%.
 
We also originate residential construction and land development loans for one-to-four family homes.  At December 31, 2016, residential construction and land development loans totaled $20.8 million, which represented 3.4% of our total loan portfolio, all of which were performing in accordance with their terms. Residential construction loans are typically for a term of 12 months with interest payable monthly, and are generally followed by an automatic conversion to a 15-year or 30-year permanent loan with monthly payments of principal and interest.  Residential construction loans are generally made only to homeowners and the repayment of such loans generally comes from the proceeds of a permanent mortgage loan for which a commitment is typically in place when the construction loan is originated.  We generally require a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% for all construction loans unless Private Mortgage Insurance is obtained to allow for higher loan-to-value ratios.
 
Interest rates on all construction loans are generally tied to an index plus an applicable spread and funds are disbursed on a percentage-of-completion basis following an inspection by a third party inspector.
 
We also selectively originate loans to individuals and developers for the purpose of developing vacant land in our primary market area, typically for building an individual’s future residence or, in the case of a developer, residential subdivisions. Land development loans, which are offered for terms of up to 18 months, are generally indexed either to the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal or to LIBOR, plus an applicable margin. We generally require a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75% of the discounted market value based upon expected cash flows upon completion of the project. We also originate loans to individuals secured by undeveloped land held for investment purposes. These loans are typically amortized for no more than fifteen years with a three- or five-year balloon payment. At December 31, 2016, our largest commercial land development loan had an outstanding balance of $207,000, which was performing in accordance with its terms.
 
Revolving Mortgages and Consumer Loans. We offer revolving mortgage loans, which consist of home equity loans and lines of credit, and various consumer loans, including automobile loans and loans secured by deposits. At December 31, 2016, revolving mortgage loans totaled $66.9 million, or 11.1% of our total loan portfolio, of which $66.5 million were performing in accordance with their terms, and consumer loans totaled $22.8 million, or 3.8% of our total loan portfolio, substantially all of which were performing in accordance with their terms. Our revolving mortgage loans consist of both home equity loans with fixed-rate amortizing terms of up to 15 years and adjustable rate lines of credit with interest rates indexed either to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal or to LIBOR, plus or minus an applicable margin. At December 31, 2016, our largest outstanding revolving mortgage loan balance was $714,000, which was performing in accordance with its terms. Consumer loans typically have shorter maturities and higher interest rates than traditional one-to-four family lending. In most cases, we do not originate home equity loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80%, including any first mortgage loan balance. The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. During 2015, we discontinued the indirect origination of automobile loans through local dealers, although we continue to offer loans secured by motor vehicles directly to consumers.

Commercial and Industrial Loans. We typically offer commercial and industrial loans to small businesses located in our primary market area. At December 31, 2016, commercial and industrial loans totaled $23.8 million, which represented 3.9% of our total loan portfolio, substantially all of which were performing. Commercial and industrial loans consist of floating rate loans indexed either to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal or to LIBOR, plus an applicable margin and fixed rate loans for terms of up to 10 years, depending on the useful life and type of collateral. Our commercial and industrial loan portfolio consists primarily of loans that are secured by equipment, accounts receivable and inventory, but also includes a smaller amount of unsecured loans for purposes of financing expansion or providing working capital for general business purposes. Key loan terms vary depending on the collateral, the borrower’s financial condition, credit history and other relevant factors. At December 31, 2016, our largest commercial and industrial relationship had an outstanding balance of $5.2 million, was secured by a blanket first lien on all business assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, furniture, fixtures and equipment, in addition to an assignment of insurance on the owner’s life. The loan was performing in accordance with its terms.
 
Loan Underwriting
 
Adjustable-Rate Loans. While we anticipate that adjustable-rate loans will better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate mortgages, an increased monthly mortgage payment required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits.
Commercial Mortgage Loans. Loans secured by commercial real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in commercial mortgage lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income producing properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. We apply what we believe to be conservative underwriting standards when originating commercial mortgage loans and seek to limit our exposure to lending concentrations to related borrowers, types of business and geographies, as well as seeking to participate with other banks in both buying and selling larger loans of this nature. Management has hired additional experienced lending officers and credit management personnel over the past several years in order to continue to safely manage this type of lending. To monitor cash flows on income producing properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, to provide annual financial statements on commercial real estate loans. In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial real estate loan, we consider and review a global cash flow analysis of the borrower and consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability, and the value of the underlying property. An environmental survey is obtained when the possibility exists that hazardous materials may have existed on the site, or the site may have been impacted by adjoining properties that handled hazardous materials.

Construction and Land Development Loans. Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the building. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or before the maturity of the loan, with a building having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment if liquidation is required. If we are forced to foreclose on a building before or at completion due to a default, we may be unable to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, speculative construction loans, which are loans made to home builders who, at the time of loan origination, have not yet secured an end buyer for the home under construction, typically carry higher risks than those associated with traditional construction loans. These increased risks arise because of the risk that there will be inadequate demand to ensure the sale of the property within an acceptable time. As a result, in addition to the risks associated with traditional construction loans, speculative construction loans carry the added risk that the builder will have to pay the property taxes and other carrying costs of the property until an end buyer is found. Land development loans have substantially similar risks to speculative construction loans. To monitor cash flows on construction properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, to provide annual financial statements and, in reaching a decision on whether to make a construction or land development loan, we consider and review a global cash flow analysis of the borrower and consider the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability. We also generally disburse funds on a percentage-of-completion basis following an inspection by a third party inspector.
Revolving Mortgages and Consumer Loans. Consumer loans may entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as motor vehicles. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and a small remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. During 2015, we discontinued the indirect origination of automobile loans through local dealers, which resulted in a decline in our consumer loan portfolio.  We continue to offer loans secured by motor vehicles directly to consumers.  In the case of home equity loans, real estate values may be reduced to a level that is insufficient to cover the outstanding loan balance after accounting for the first mortgage loan balance. Consumer loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.
Commercial and Industrial Loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment income or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial and industrial loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial and industrial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value.
Loans to One Borrower. The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities is generally limited by regulation to 15% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus.  At December 31, 2016, our regulatory limit on loans to one borrower was $14.1 million. At that date, our largest lending relationship consisted of ten loans and one line of credit to five different entities. The loans have personal guarantees from the owners and are secured by nine separate income producing commercial rental properties. The collateral properties range from office and retail to industrial warehouse located in Asheville, North Carolina with a total outstanding balance of $10.6 million.  The loans are performing in accordance to their original loan terms.
 
 10
 

Loan Commitments. We typically issue commitments for most loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. Commitments to originate loans are legally binding agreements to lend to our customers. Generally, our loan commitments expire after 45 to 60 days. See note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
Investment Activities
 
We have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored agencies and of state and municipal governments, mortgage-backed securities and certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions. Within certain regulatory limits, we also may invest a portion of our assets in other permissible securities. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, we also are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta stock, which is not publicly traded.
 
At December 31, 2016, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities, securities issued by government sponsored enterprises and securities issued by state and local governments. We do not currently invest in trading account securities.
 
Our investment objectives are: (i) to provide and maintain liquidity within the guidelines of North Carolina banking law and the regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and (ii) to manage interest rate risk. Our Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of the investment policy. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer are responsible for implementation of the investment policy and monitoring our investment performance. Our Board of Directors reviews the status of our investment portfolio on a monthly basis.
 
Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds
 
General. Deposits, borrowings and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions.
Deposit Accounts. Deposits are attracted from within our primary market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including noninterest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand accounts (such as NOW and money market accounts), regular savings accounts and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, profitability to us, matching deposit and loan products and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing weekly. Our deposit pricing strategy has typically been to offer competitive rates on all types of deposit products, and to periodically offer special rates in order to attract deposits of a specific type or term.
Borrowings. We use advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta to supplement our investable funds. The Federal Home Loan Bank functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate, range of maturities and prepayment penalties. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution’s net worth, the Federal Home Loan Bank’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness, collateral value and level of Federal Home Loan Bank stock ownership. We also utilize securities sold under agreements to repurchase and overnight repurchase agreements to supplement our supply of investable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements.

Financial Services
 
The Bank has an agreement with LPL Financial LLC (“LPL”), a third-party registered broker-dealer, through which the Bank offers its customers, under the brand of Asheville Savings Investment Services, a complete range of nondeposit investment products, including mutual funds, debt, equity and government securities, retirement accounts, insurance products and fixed and variable annuities.  Pursuant to the agreement with LPL, the Bank received fees of $243,000, $217,000 and $268,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Subsidiaries
 
The Bank is the Company’s sole wholly owned subsidiary. The Bank has two subsidiaries, Appalachian Financial Services, Inc., which was formed to engage in investment activities and is currently inactive, and Wenoca, Inc., which serves as the Bank’s trustee regarding deeds of trust. Both subsidiaries are organized as North Carolina corporations.
REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
 
The Bank is a North Carolina chartered savings bank and the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a North Carolina corporation and registered bank holding company. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”). The Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks (the “NCCoB”), as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, as its deposit insurer. The Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the NCCoB concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and, for purposes of the FDIC, the protection of the insurance fund. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the “FHLB of Atlanta” or “FHLB”). The Company is regulated as a bank holding company by the Federal Reserve Board (the “FRB”) and the NCCoB. Any change in such regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the North Carolina legislature, the FDIC, the FRB or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Company, the Bank and their operations.
 
Certain regulatory requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank are referred to below or elsewhere herein. This description of statutes and regulations is intended to be a summary of the material provisions of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Company and the Bank. You are encouraged to reference the actual statutes and regulations for additional information.
 
Recent Regulatory Reform
 
Although the financial crisis has now passed, two legislative and regulatory responses – the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and the Basel III-based capital rules – will continue to have an impact on our operations.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 
The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act impacts financial institutions in numerous ways, including, among others:
 
 
• | The creation of a Financial Stability Oversight Council responsible for monitoring and managing systemic risk;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 12
 

 
• | Granting additional authority to the Federal Reserve to regulate certain types of nonbank financial companies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Granting new authority to the FDIC as liquidator and receiver;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changing the manner in which deposit insurance assessments are made;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Requiring regulators to modify capital standards;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capping interchange fees that banks with total assets of $10 billion or more charge merchants for debit card transactions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Imposing more stringent requirements on mortgage lenders; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limiting banks’ proprietary trading activities.
--+------------------------------------------------



There are many provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act mandating regulators to adopt new regulations and conduct studies upon which future regulation may be based. While some have been issued, many remain to be issued. Governmental intervention and new regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Basel Capital Standards
 
Regulatory capital rules released by the federal bank regulatory agencies in July 2013 to implement capital standards, referred to as Basel III and developed by an international body known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, impose higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with more than $1 billion in total consolidated assets. More stringent requirements are imposed on “advanced approaches” banking organizations ‒ which are organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures, or that have opted in to the Basel II capital regime.  The new regulatory capital rules began to phase in on January 1, 2015 for the Company and the Bank,  and all of the requirements in the rules will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019.
 
The rules include certain new and higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously in place. Specifically, the following minimum capital requirements apply to us:
 
 
• | a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the former 4% requirement);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from the former requirement); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a leverage ratio of 4% (also unchanged from the former requirement).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------



Under the rules, Tier 1 capital is redefined to include two components: common equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The new and highest form of capital, common equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. The rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets to continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital, but not in common equity Tier 1 capital, subject to certain restrictions. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that currently qualify in Tier 2 capital plus instruments
 
 13
 

that the rules have disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment.  Cumulative perpetual preferred stock, formerly includable in Tier 1 capital, is now included only in Tier 2 capital.  Accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) is presumptively included in common equity Tier 1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital.  The rules provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. We elected to opt out from the inclusion of AOCI in common equity Tier 1 capital.
 
In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally over time, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019, and will consist of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.  As of January 1, 2017, our conservation buffers were 11.04% for common equity Tier 1 capital, 9.54% for Tier 1 capital and 9.77% for total capital.
 
In general, the rules have had the effect of increasing capital requirements by increasing the risk weights on certain assets, including high volatility commercial real estate, certain loans past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status, mortgage servicing rights not includable in common equity Tier 1 capital, equity exposures, and claims on securities firms, that are used in the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios.
 
It is management’s belief that, as of December 31, 2016, the Company and the Bank would have met all capital adequacy requirements under the new capital rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were effective at that time.
 
Volcker Rule
 
Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the “Volcker Rule,” prohibits any bank, bank holding company, or affiliate (referred to collectively as “banking entities”) from engaging in two types of activities: “proprietary trading” and the ownership or sponsorship of private equity or hedge funds that are referred to as “covered funds.”  Proprietary trading is, in general, trading in securities on a short-term basis for a banking entity’s own account.  Funds subject to the ownership and sponsorship prohibition are those not required to register with the SEC because they have only accredited investors or no more than 100 investors. In December 2013, the federal banking agencies, together with the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, finalized a regulation to implement the Volcker Rule.  The Volcker Rule does not have a material effect on our operations as we do not engage in proprietary trading or own or sponsor covered funds.  The Company may incur costs to adopt additional policies and systems to ensure compliance with the Volcker Rule, but any such costs are not expected to be material.
North Carolina Banking Laws and Supervision
 
General. As a North Carolina savings bank, Asheville Savings is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the NCCoB and to various North Carolina statutes and regulations which govern, among other things, investment powers, lending and deposit taking activities, borrowings, maintenance of surplus and reserve accounts, distributions of earnings and payment of dividends. In addition, Asheville Savings is also subject to North Carolina consumer protection and civil rights laws and regulations. The approval of the NCCoB is required for a North Carolina savings bank to establish or relocate branches, merge with other financial institutions, organize a holding company, issue stock and undertake certain other activities.
 
 14
 

Net Worth Requirement. North Carolina law requires that a North Carolina savings bank maintain a net worth of not less than 5% of its total assets. Intangible assets must be deducted from net worth and assets when computing compliance with this requirement.
Investment Activities. Subject to limitation by the NCCoB, North Carolina savings banks may make any loan or investment or engage in any activity that is permitted to federally chartered institutions. In addition to such lending authority, North Carolina savings banks are generally authorized to invest funds in certain statutorily permitted investments, including but not limited to (i) obligations of the United States, or those guaranteed by it; (ii) obligations of the State of North Carolina; (iii) bank demand or time deposits; (iv) stock or obligations of the federal deposit insurance fund or a Federal Home Loan Bank; (v) savings accounts of any savings institution as approved by the board of directors; and (vi) stock or obligations of any agency of the State of North Carolina or of the United States or of any corporation doing business in North Carolina whose principal business is to make education loans. However, a North Carolina savings bank cannot invest more than 15% of its total assets in business, commercial, corporate and agricultural loans, and cannot directly or indirectly acquire or retain any corporate debt security that is not of investment grade.
Loans to One Borrower Limitations. North Carolina law provides state savings banks with broad lending authority. However, subject to certain limited exceptions, no loans and extensions of credit to any borrower outstanding at one time and not fully secured by readily marketable collateral shall exceed 15% of the net worth of the savings bank, as defined. In addition, loans and extensions of credit fully secured by readily marketable collateral may not exceed 10% of the net worth of the savings bank. These limitations do not apply to loans or obligations made: (i) for any purpose otherwise permitted under North Carolina law in an amount not to exceed $500,000; (ii) to develop domestic residential housing units, not to exceed the lesser of $30 million or 30% of the savings bank’s net worth, provided that the purchase price of each single-family dwelling in the development does not exceed $500,000 and the aggregate amount of loans made pursuant to this authority does not exceed 150% of the savings bank’s net worth; or (iii) to finance the sale of real property acquired in satisfaction of debts in an amount up to 50% of the savings bank’s net worth.
Dividends. A North Carolina stock savings bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend on, or repurchase any of, its capital stock if after making such distribution, the institution would become, or if it already is, “undercapitalized” (as such term is defined under applicable law and regulations) or such transaction would reduce the net worth of the institution to an amount which is less than the minimum amount required by applicable federal and state regulations.
Regulatory Enforcement Authority. Any North Carolina savings bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives of the NCCoB may be subject to sanctions for noncompliance, including revocation of its articles of incorporation. The NCCoB may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors of a state savings bank who have violated the law or conducted the bank’s business in a manner which is unsafe or unsound. Upon finding that a state savings bank has engaged in an unsafe, unsound or discriminatory manner, the NCCoB may issue an order to cease and desist and impose civil monetary penalties on the institution.
Federal Banking Regulations
 
Capital Requirements.  In July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued new regulatory capital rules that impose higher minimum capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies.  The new regulatory capital rules, which include  certain new and higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those in place, began to phase in on January 1, 2015 for the Company and the Bank, and all of the requirements in the rules will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019.  See “Regulation and Supervision – Basel Capital Standards” for further information.
 
 15
 

Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit system, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. Most recently, the agencies have established standards for safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.
 
Investment Activities. Since the enactment of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (the “FDICIA”), all state-chartered federally insured banks, including savings banks, have generally been limited in their investment activities to principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law. The FDICIA and the FDIC regulations promulgated thereunder permit exceptions to these limitations. For example, state chartered banks may, with FDIC approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq Global Market and in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The maximum permissible investment is 100% of Tier 1 Capital, as specified by the FDIC’s regulations, or the maximum amount permitted by North Carolina law, whichever is less. In addition, the FDIC is authorized to permit such institutions to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if they meet  all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 specifies that a non-member bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a “financial subsidiary” if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes.
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. As an insured depository institution, the Bank is required to comply the capital requirements promulgated under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the prompt corrective action regulations thereunder, which set forth five capital categories, each with specific regulatory consequences.  Under these regulations, the categories are:

• | Well Capitalized – The institution exceeds the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. A well capitalized institution (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of 5% or greater, and (v) is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adequately Capitalized – The institution meets the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. No capital distribution may be made that would result in the institution becoming undercapitalized. An adequately capitalized institution (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, and (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of 4% or greater. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Undercapitalized – The institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. An undercapitalized institution (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5%, or (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of less than 4%. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 16
 

 
• | Significantly Undercapitalized – The institution is significantly below the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. A significantly undercapitalized institution (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3%, or (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of less than 3%. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Critically Undercapitalized – The institution fails to meet a critical capital level set by the appropriate federal banking agency. A critically undercapitalized institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



If the applicable federal regulator determines, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition, the regulator is authorized to reclassify the institution to the next lower capital category (other than critically undercapitalized) and require the submission of a plan to correct the unsafe or unsound condition.
 
If the institution is not well capitalized, it cannot accept brokered deposits without prior FDIC approval. Even if approved, rate restrictions will govern the rate the institution may pay on the brokered deposits. In addition, a bank that is undercapitalized cannot offer an effective yield in excess of 75 basis points over the “national rate” paid on deposits (including brokered deposits, if approval is granted for the bank to accept them) of comparable size and maturity. The “national rate” is defined as a simple average of rates paid by insured depository institutions and branches for which data are available and is published weekly by the FDIC. Institutions subject to the restrictions that believe they are operating in an area where the rates paid on deposits are higher than the “national rate” can use the local market to determine the prevailing rate if they seek and receive a determination from the FDIC that it is operating in a high-rate area. Regardless of the determination, institutions must use the national rate to determine conformance for all deposits outside their market area.
 
Moreover, if the institution becomes less than adequately capitalized, it must adopt a capital restoration plan acceptable to the FDIC. The institution also would become subject to increased regulatory oversight, and is increasingly restricted in the scope of its permissible activities. Each company having control over an undercapitalized institution also must provide a limited guarantee that the institution will comply with its capital restoration plan. Except under limited circumstances consistent with an accepted capital restoration plan, an undercapitalized institution may not grow. An undercapitalized institution may not acquire another institution, establish additional branch offices or engage in any new line of business unless it is determined by the appropriate federal banking agency to be consistent with an accepted capital restoration plan, or unless the FDIC determines that the proposed action will further the purpose of prompt corrective action. The appropriate federal banking agency may take any action authorized for a significantly undercapitalized institution if an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails in any material respect to implement a plan accepted by the agency. A critically undercapitalized institution is subject to having a receiver or conservator appointed to manage its affairs and for loss of its charter to conduct banking activities.
 
An insured depository institution may not pay a management fee to a bank holding company controlling that institution or any other person having control of the institution if, after making the payment, the institution would be undercapitalized. In addition, an institution cannot make a capital distribution, such as a dividend or other distribution, that is in substance a distribution of capital to the owners of the institution if following such a distribution the institution would be undercapitalized.
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Bank was deemed to be “well capitalized.”
 
Transactions with Affiliates. The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank.  Various legal limitations restrict the Bank from lending or otherwise supplying funds to the Company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The Company and the Bank are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation W.
 
 17
 

Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act places limits on the amount of loans or extensions of credit by a bank to any affiliate, including its holding company, and on a bank’s investments in, or certain other transactions with, affiliates and on the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of any affiliates of the bank.  Section 23A also applies to derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions that cause a bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate.  The aggregate of all covered transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. Furthermore, within the foregoing limitations as to amount, each covered transaction must meet specified collateral requirements. The Bank is forbidden to purchase low quality assets from an affiliate.
 
Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, among other things, prohibits a bank from engaging in certain transactions with certain affiliates unless the transactions are on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to such bank or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated companies. If there are no comparable transactions, a bank’s (or one of its subsidiaries’) affiliate transaction must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to, or would apply to, nonaffiliated companies.  These requirements apply to all transactions subject to Section 23A as well as to certain other transactions.
 
The affiliates of a bank include any holding company of the bank, any other company under common control with the bank (including any company controlled by the same shareholders who control the bank), any subsidiary of the bank that is itself a bank, any company in which the majority of the directors or trustees also constitute a majority of the directors or trustees of the bank or holding company of the bank, any company sponsored and advised on a contractual basis by the bank or an affiliate, and any mutual fund advised by a bank or any of the bank’s affiliates.  Regulation W generally excludes all non-bank subsidiaries of banks from treatment as affiliates, except for subsidiaries engaged in certain nonbank financial activities or to the extent that the Federal Reserve decides to treat these subsidiaries as affiliates.
 
The Bank is also subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, certain principal shareholders, and their related interests. Extensions of credit include derivative transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions to the extent that such transactions cause a bank to have credit exposure to an insider.  Any extension of credit to an insider:
 
 
• | must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In some circumstances, approval of an extension of credit to an insider must be approved by a majority of the disinterested directors. Extensions of credit to any one insider are capped at 10% of a bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, with an additional 10% for loans secured by readily marketable collateral. Extensions of credit to all insiders are capped at 100% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.
 
In addition, the Bank may not purchase an asset from or sell an asset to an insider unless the transaction is on market terms and, if representing more than 10% of capital, is approved in advance by the majority of disinterested directors.
 
 18
 

Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured state-chartered savings banks, including Asheville Savings. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. The FDIC has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under limited circumstances. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was “critically undercapitalized” on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became “critically undercapitalized.” The FDIC may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non-member institution under specific circumstances on the basis of the institution’s financial condition or upon the occurrence of other events, including: (i) insolvency; (ii) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (iii) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; and (iv) insufficient capital, or the incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions such as Asheville Savings. Deposit accounts at the Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts.  The FDIC charges the insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund.
 
FDIC deposit assessments are currently based on an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity as opposed to total deposits. Since the current base is much larger than the previous base, the FDIC lowered assessment rates so that the total amount of revenue collected from the industry would not be significantly altered. These adjustments are expected to benefit smaller financial institutions, which typically rely more on deposits for funding, and shift more of the burden for supporting the insurance fund to larger institutions, which have greater access to non-deposit sources of funding. The Bank’s 2016 FDIC insurance cost decreased approximately $179,000 primarily as a result of these changes.
 
Federal Home Loan Bank System. Asheville Savings is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of eleven regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Asheville Savings, as a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in that Federal Home Loan Bank. At December 31, 2016, Asheville Savings complied with this requirement with an investment in FHLB of Atlanta stock of $2.8 million.
 
The Federal Home Loan Banks were required to provide funds for the resolution of insolvent thrifts in the late 1980s and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs. These requirements, or general results of operations, could reduce or eliminate the dividends that the Federal Home Loan Banks pay to their members and result in the Federal Home Loan Banks imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members. If dividends were reduced, or interest on future Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased, our net interest income would likely also be reduced.

Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, as implemented by FDIC regulations, a savings association has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The Community Reinvestment Act does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The Community Reinvestment Act requires the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a savings institution, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution.
 
The Community Reinvestment Act requires public disclosure of an institution’s rating and requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to provide a written evaluation of an association’s Community Reinvestment Act performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system.
 
Asheville Savings received a “satisfactory” rating as a result of its most recent Community Reinvestment Act assessment.
 
Other Regulations
 
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Asheville Savings are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

• | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The operations of Asheville Savings also are subject to, among other things, the:

Among other provisions, it requires financial institutions operating in the United States to develop new anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering.

Federal Reserve System
 
The FRB regulations require savings institutions to maintain noninterest earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (“NOW”) and regular checking accounts). The regulations generally provide that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: a 3% reserve ratio is assessed on net transaction accounts greater than $15.2 million and less than $110.2 million; a 10% reserve ratio is assessed on net transaction accounts greater than $110.2 million. The first $15.2 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the FRB) are exempted from the reserve requirements. The amounts are adjusted annually. Asheville Savings complies with the foregoing requirements.
Holding Company Regulation
 
The Company is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, as administered by the FRB. As a result, prior FRB approval would be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. In addition to the approval of the FRB, before any bank acquisition can be completed, prior approval may also be required to be obtained from other agencies having supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired.
 
A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the FRB has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings and loan association.
 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorizes a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including being “well capitalized” and “well managed,” to opt to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking.
 
The Company is also subject to the FRB’s capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies (on a consolidated basis) substantially similar to those of the FDIC for Asheville Savings.
 
 21
 

A bank holding company is generally required to give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, FRB order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the FRB. The FRB has adopted an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions.
 
The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the FRB’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The FRB’s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
 
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default. This law would have potential applicability if the Company ever held as a separate subsidiary a depository institution in addition to Asheville Savings.
 
The Company and the Bank will be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of various agencies of the United States Government, including the Federal Reserve System. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, it is impossible for management to accurately predict future changes in monetary policy or the effect of such changes on the business or financial condition of the Company or the Bank.
 
The status of the Company as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act will not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws.
 
Federal Securities Laws
 
The Company’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a result, the Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer each are required to certify that the Company’s quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange

Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal controls; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors about our internal controls; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls.
 
FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION
 
Federal Income Taxation
 
General. We report our income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting. The federal income tax laws apply to us in the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly our reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us. The Bank’s federal income tax returns were examined for 2008, 2009 and 2010. For its 2016 and 2015 calendar years, the Company’s maximum marginal federal income tax rate was 34%.
 
The Company and the Bank have entered into a tax allocation agreement. Because the Company owns 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Bank, the Company and the Bank are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, of which group the Company is the common parent corporation. As a result of this affiliation, the Bank may be included in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return with the Company and, if a decision to file a consolidated tax return is made, the parties agree to compensate each other for their individual share of the consolidated tax liability and/or any tax benefits provided by them in the filing of the consolidated federal income tax return.
 
Bad Debt Reserves. For fiscal years beginning before June 30, 1996, thrift institutions that qualified under certain definitional tests and other conditions of the Internal Revenue Code were permitted to use certain favorable provisions to calculate their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve. A reserve could be established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans, generally secured by interests in real property improved or to be improved, under the percentage of taxable income method or the experience method. The reserve for nonqualifying loans was computed using the experience method. Federal legislation enacted in 1996 repealed the reserve method of accounting for bad debts and the percentage of taxable income method for tax years beginning after 1995 and require savings institutions to recapture or take into income certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves.
Distributions. If Asheville Savings makes “non-dividend distributions” to the Company, the distributions will be considered to have been made from the Bank’s unrecaptured tax bad debt reserves, including the balance of its reserves as of December 31, 1987, to the extent of the “non-dividend distributions,” and then from the Bank’s supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent of those reserves, and an amount based on the amount distributed, but not more than the amount of those reserves, will be included in the Bank’s taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Bank’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. Dividends paid out of the Bank’s current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be so included in the Bank’s taxable income.
 
The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Therefore, if Asheville Savings makes a non-dividend distribution to the Company, approximately one and one-half times the amount of the distribution not in excess of the amount of the reserves would be includable in income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 34% federal corporate income tax rate. Asheville Savings does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves.

State Taxation
 
North Carolina. North Carolina imposes corporate income and franchise taxes. North Carolina’s corporate income tax was 4% for 2016 for the portion of a corporation’s net income allocable to the state. If a corporation in North Carolina does business in North Carolina and in one or more other states, North Carolina taxes a fraction of the corporation’s income based on the amount of sales, payroll and property it maintains within North Carolina.  Effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, North Carolina’s corporate income tax rate decreased to 6% from 6.9%.  Effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, North Carolina’s corporate income tax rate decreased to 5% from 6.%.  Effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, North Carolina’s corporate income tax rate decreased to 4% from 5%.  Effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, North Carolina’s corporate income tax rate decreased to 3% from 4%.  Reductions in North Carolina’s corporate income tax rates have the effect of reducing income taxes on current taxable income, but such reductions also have the effect of increasing income taxes on deferred tax assets that represent tax deductions deferred to future periods because the Federal income tax benefits from the state income taxes attributable to the deferred deductions are lower.  North Carolina franchise tax is levied on business corporations at the rate of $1.50 per $1,000 of the largest of the following three alternate bases: (i) the amount of the corporation’s capital stock, surplus and undivided profits apportionable to the state; (ii) 55% of the appraised value of the corporation’s property in the state subject to local taxation; or (iii) the book value of the corporation’s real and tangible personal property in the state less any outstanding debt that was created to acquire or improve real property in the state.
 
Any cash dividends, in excess of a certain exempt amount, that would be paid with respect to ASB Bancorp, Inc. common stock to a shareholder (including a partnership and certain other entities) who is a resident of North Carolina will be subject to the North Carolina income tax. Any distribution by a corporation from earnings according to percentage ownership is considered a dividend, and the definition of a dividend for North Carolina income tax purposes may not be the same as the definition of a dividend for federal income tax purposes. A corporate distribution may be treated as a dividend for North Carolina income tax purposes if it is paid from funds that exceed the corporation’s earned surplus and profits under certain circumstances.
