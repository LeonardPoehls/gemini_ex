ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General
Columbia Property Trust, Inc. ("Columbia Property Trust") (NYSE: CXP) is a Maryland corporation that operates as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes and owns and operates commercial real estate properties. Columbia Property Trust was incorporated in 2003, commenced operations in 2004, and conducts business primarily through Columbia Property Trust Operating Partnership, L.P. ("Columbia Property Trust OP"), a Delaware limited partnership. Columbia Property Trust is the general partner and sole owner of Columbia Property Trust OP and possesses full legal control and authority over its operations. Columbia Property Trust OP acquires, redevelops, owns, leases, and operates real properties directly, through wholly owned subsidiaries, and through unconsolidated joint ventures. Unless otherwise noted herein, references to Columbia Property Trust, "we," "us," or "our" herein shall include Columbia Property Trust and all subsidiaries of Columbia Property Trust, direct and indirect.
Columbia Property Trust typically invests in high-quality, income-generating office properties. As of December 31, 2017, Columbia Property Trust owned 19 operating properties, of which 14 were wholly owned and five were owned through unconsolidated joint ventures. These properties are located primarily in New York, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta, contain a total of 9.2 million rentable square feet, and were approximately 96.2% leased as of December 31, 2017. 
Real Estate Investment Objectives 
Columbia Property Trust seeks to invest in and manage a commercial real estate portfolio that provides the size, quality, and market specialization needed to deliver both income and long-term growth, as measured in the total return to our shareholders. Our primary strategic objective is to generate long-term shareholder returns from a combination of steadily growing cash flows and appreciation in our net asset values, through the acquisition and ownership of high-quality office buildings located principally in high-barrier-to-entry markets. Our value creation and growth strategies are founded in the following:
Targeted Market Strategy 
Our portfolio consists of a combination of multi- and single-tenant office properties located primarily in Central Business Districts ("CBD"). We focus our acquisition efforts in select primary markets with strong fundamentals and liquidity, including CBD and urban in-fill locations. We believe that the major U.S. office markets provide the greatest opportunity for increasing net income and property values over time. We maintain a long-term goal of increasing our presence in our target markets in order to leverage our scale, efficiency, and market knowledge.
New Investment Targets 
We look to acquire strategic and premier office assets with quality tenants in our target markets. We concentrate on office buildings that are competitive within the top tier of their markets or that can be repositioned as such through value-add initiatives. In addition, our investment objectives include optimizing our portfolio allocation between stabilized investments and more growth-oriented, value-add investments, with an emphasis on central business districts and multi-tenant buildings.
Strong and Flexible Balance Sheet 
We are committed to maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet with a strong liquidity profile and proven access to capital. Our leverage level and other credit metrics provide the financial flexibility to pursue new acquisitions and other growth opportunities that will further our long-term performance objectives.
Capital Recycling 
To date, we have primarily sold non-strategic assets to increase our concentration in our target markets. In the future, we also anticipate selling some assets from our target markets to maintain a well-balanced portfolio and to harvest capital from mature assets. Our goals are to foster long-term growth and capital appreciation in our portfolio by maintaining the following:   an appropriate balance of core investments relative to value-add investments, building profiles that will continue to attract prospects for future rent growth, and activity levels that will continue to support our connections in the real estate community. We routinely evaluate our portfolio to identify assets that are good candidates for disposition in the furtherance of these goals.
Proactive Asset Management 
We believe our team is well equipped to deliver operating results in all facets of the management process. Our leasing efforts are founded in understanding the varied and complex needs of tenants in the marketplace today. We pursue meeting those needs through new and renewal leases, as well as lease restructures that further our long-term goals. We are committed to prudent capital

Segment Information
As of December 31, 2017, our reportable segments are determined based on the geographic markets in which we have significant investments. We consider geographic location when evaluating our portfolio composition and in assessing the ongoing operations and performance of our properties. See Note 14, Segment Information, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 94 people.
Competition
Leasing real estate is highly competitive in the current market. As a result, we experience competition for high-quality tenants from owners and managers of competing projects. Therefore, we may experience delays in re-leasing vacant space; or we may have to provide rent concessions, incur charges for tenant improvements, or offer other inducements to enable us to timely lease vacant space, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, we are in competition with other potential buyers for the acquisition of the same properties, which may result in an increase in the amount we must pay to purchase a property. Further, at the time we elect to dispose of our properties, we will also be in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers. 
Concentration of Credit Risk
We are dependent upon the ability of our current tenants to pay their contractual rent amounts as they become due. The inability of a tenant to pay future rental amounts would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We are not aware of any reason why our current tenants would not be able to pay their contractual rental amounts as they become due in all material respects. Situations preventing our tenants from paying contractual rents could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Based on our 2017 annualized lease revenue, no single tenant accounts for more than 6% of our portfolio.
