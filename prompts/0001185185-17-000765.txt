Item 1                          Description of Business
 
Royale Energy, Inc. ("Royale Energy” or the “Company") is an independent oil and natural gas producer.  Royale Energy's principal lines of business are the production and sale of natural gas, acquisition of oil and gas lease interests and proved reserves, drilling of both exploratory and development wells, and sales of fractional working interests in wells to be drilled by Royale Energy.  Royale Energy was incorporated in California in 1986 and began operations in 1988.  Royale Energy's common stock is traded on the Over-The-Counter QB (OTCQB) Market System (symbol ROYL).  On December 31, 2016, Royale Energy had 11 full time employees.
 
Merger with Matrix Oil Management Corporation
 
In July 2016, we entered into a letter of intent with Matrix Oil Management Corporation (“Matrix”) to merge Royale Energy and Matrix in a combined stock and assumption of debt transaction.  On November 30, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated November 30, 2016, among Royale, Royale Energy Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Parent”), Royale Merger Sub, Inc., a California corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, Matrix Merger Sub, Inc., a California corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and Matrix.  The Merger Agreement was subsequently amended and restated as of December 31, 2016 (the “Merger Agreement”).
 
The Merger Agreement is part of a series of related transactions in which the Parent will (i) issue its common stock to acquire all of (A) the common stock of Royale Energy, Matrix and Matrix’s affiliate, Matrix Oil Corporation, a California corporation, and (B) the partnership interests of three limited partnerships affiliated with Matrix and (ii) issue newly created Series B 3.5% Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for approximately $20,124,000 of subordinated debt issued by Matrix and its affiliates.
 
Immediately after the mergers and the related transactions, it is expected that (i) former holders of Matrix common stock, Matrix Oil Corporation capital stock and the three limited partnerships affiliated with Matrix will collectively own 50% of the Parent’s common stock then outstanding, (ii) former holders of Royale Energy common stock will collectively own 50% of the Parent’s common stock then outstanding, in each case giving effect to the number of shares of the Parent’s common stock issuable under all options and warrants outstanding immediately after the mergers other than shares issuable on exercise of certain options and warrants issued by Royale Energy and (iii) former holders of subordinated debt issued by Matrix and its affiliates will collectively own 100% of all of the Parent’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding.
 
The merger and related transactions will require the approval of the shareholders of each company and registration of the Royale Energy equity securities to be issued in the merger under the Securities Act of 1933 prior to completion of the transaction. 
 
Matrix is an independent oil and natural gas producer based in Santa Barbara, California.  Matrix and its affiliates are privately held by fewer than ten equity holders and partners.
 
Royale Energy, Inc.
 
Royale Energy owns wells and leases located mainly in the Sacramento Basin and San Joaquin Basin in California as well as in Utah, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.  Royale Energy usually sells a portion of the working interest in each well it drills or participates in to third party investors and retains a portion of the prospect for its own account.  Selling part of the working interest to others allows Royale Energy to reduce its drilling risk by owning a diversified inventory of properties with less of its own funds invested in each drilling prospect, than if Royale Energy owned all the working interest and paid all drilling and development costs of each prospect itself.  Royale Energy generally sells working interests in its prospects to accredited investors in exempt securities offerings.  The prospects are bundled into multi-well investments, which permit the third party investors to diversify their investments by investing in several wells at once instead of investing in single well prospects.
 
During its fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, Royale Energy continued to explore and develop natural gas properties with a concentration in California.  Additionally, we own proved developed producing and non-producing reserves of oil and natural gas in Utah, Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, as well as holding an overriding royalty interest in a discovery in Alaska.  In 2016, Royale Energy drilled three wells in northern California; which were all commercially productive.  Royale Energy's estimated total reserves were approximately 2.1 and 2.5 BCFE (billion cubic feet equivalent) at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  According to the reserve reports furnished by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., Royale Energy's independent petroleum engineers, the undiscounted net reserve value of its proved developed and undeveloped reserves was approximately $3.0 million at December 31, 2016, based on the natural gas average PG&E city-gate spot price of $2.76 per MCF.  Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. supplied reserve value estimates for the Company’s California, Texas, Oklahoma, Utah and Louisiana properties.

Of course, net reserve value does not represent the fair market value of our reserves on that date, and we cannot be sure what return we will eventually receive on our reserves.  Net reserve value of proved developed and undeveloped reserves was calculated by subtracting estimated future development costs, future production costs and other operating expenses from estimated net future cash flows from our developed and undeveloped reserves.
 
Our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at December 31, 2016, was estimated to be $1,483,272.  This figure was calculated by subtracting our estimated future income tax expense from the net reserve value of proved developed and undeveloped reserves, and by further applying a 10% annual discount for estimated timing of cash flows.  A detailed calculation of our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow is contained in Supplemental Information about Oil and Gas Producing Activities – Changes in Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flow from Proved Reserve Quantities, page F-24.
 
Royale Energy reported a gain on turnkey drilling in connection with the drilling of wells on a "turnkey contract" basis in the amount of $460,210 and $2,330,969 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
In addition to Royale Energy's own staff, Royale Energy hires independent contractors to drill, test, complete and equip the wells that it drills.  Approximately 44.4% of Royale Energy's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, came from sales of oil and natural gas from production of its wells in the amount of $538,631.  In 2015, this amount was $1,018,928, which represented 59.5% of Royale Energy's total revenues.
 
Plan of Business
 
Royale Energy acquires interests in oil and natural gas reserves and sponsors private joint ventures.  Royale Energy believes that its stockholders are better served by diversification of its investments among individual drilling prospects.  Through its sale of joint ventures, Royale Energy can acquire interests and develop oil and natural gas properties with greater diversification of risk and still receive an interest in the revenues and reserves produced from these properties.  By selling some of its working interest in most projects, Royale Energy decreases the amount of its investment in the projects and diversifies its oil and gas property holdings, to reduce the risk of concentrating a large amount of its capital in a few projects that may not be successful.
 
After acquiring the leases or lease participation, Royale Energy drills or participates in the drilling of development and exploratory oil and natural gas wells on its property.  Royale Energy pays its proportionate share of the actual cost of drilling, testing, and completing the project to the extent that it retains all or any portion of the working interest.
 
Royale Energy also may sell fractional working interests in undeveloped wells to finance part of the drilling cost. A drilling contract that calls for a company to drill a well, for a fixed price, to a specified depth or geological formation is called a "turnkey contract." When Royale Energy sells fractional working interests in unproved property to raise capital to drill oil and natural gas wells, generally it agrees to drill these wells on a turnkey contract basis, so that the holders of the fractional interests prepay a fixed amount for the drilling and completion of a specified number of wells.  Under a turnkey contract, Royale Energy may record a gain if total funds received to drill a well were more than the actual cost to drill those wells including costs incurred on behalf of the participants and costs incurred for its own account.
 
Although Royale Energy’s operating agreements do not usually address whether investors have a right to participate in subsequent wells in the same area of interest as a proposed well, it is the Company’s policy to offer to investors in a successful well the right to participate in subsequent wells at the same percentage level as their working interest investment in the prior successful well.
 
Our policy for turnkey drilling agreements is to recognize a gain on turnkey drilling programs after our obligations have been fulfilled, and a gain is only recorded when funds received from participants are in excess of all costs Royale incurs during the drilling programs (e.g., lease acquisition, exploration and development costs), including costs incurred on behalf of participants and costs incurred for its own account.  See Note 1 to our Financial Statements, at page F-8.
 
Once drilling has commenced, it is generally completed within 10-30 days.  See Note 1 to Royale Energy's Financial Statements, at page F-8.  Royale Energy maintains internal records of the expenditure of each investor's funds for drilling projects.
 
Royale Energy generally operates the wells it completes.  As operator, it receives fees set by industry standards from the owners of fractional interests in the wells and from expense reimbursements.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, Royale Energy earned gross revenues from operation of the wells in the amount of $406,560 representing 33.5% of its total revenues for the year.  In 2015, the amount was $503,441, which represented about 29.4% of total revenues.  At December 31, 2016, Royale Energy operated 31 natural gas wells in California. Royale also has non-operating interests in three natural gas wells in Utah, four oil and gas wells in Texas, two in Oklahoma, four in California, and two in Louisiana.

Royale Energy currently sells most of its California natural gas production through PG&E pipelines to independent customers on a monthly contract basis, while some gas is delivered through privately owned pipelines to independent customers. Since many users are willing to make such purchase arrangements, the loss of any one customer would not affect our overall sales operations.
 
All oil and natural gas properties are depleting assets in which production naturally decreases over time as the finite amount of existing reserves are produced and sold.  It is Royale Energy’s business as an oil and natural gas exploration and production company to continually search for new development properties.  The Company’s success will ultimately depend on its ability to continue locating and developing new oil and natural gas resources.  Natural gas demand and the prices paid for gas are seasonal. In recent years, natural gas demand and prices in Northern California have fluctuated unpredictably throughout the year.
 
In 2016, Royale Energy formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Royale DWI Investors, LLC, a California limited liability company, to hold legal title to certain oil and gas working interests which Royale Energy owns for the benefit of its working interest investors.  Royale Energy had no subsidiaries in 2015.
 
Competition, Markets and Regulation
 
Competition
 
The exploration and production of oil and natural gas is an intensely competitive industry.  The sale of interests in oil and gas projects, like those Royale Energy sells, is also very competitive.  Royale Energy encounters competition from other oil and natural gas producers, as well as from other entities that invest in oil and gas for their own account or for others, and many of these companies are substantially larger than Royale Energy.
Markets
 
Market factors affect the quantities of oil and natural gas production and the price Royale Energy can obtain for the production from its oil and natural gas properties.  Such factors include: the extent of domestic production; the level of imports of foreign oil and natural gas; the general level of market demand on a regional, national and worldwide basis; domestic and foreign economic conditions that determine levels of industrial production; political events in foreign oil-producing regions; and variations in governmental regulations including environmental, energy conservation, and tax laws or the imposition of new regulatory requirements upon the oil and natural gas industry.
Regulation
 
Federal and state laws and regulations affect, to some degree, the production, transportation, and sale of oil and natural gas from Royale Energy’s operations.  States in which Royale Energy operates have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of oil and natural gas, including provisions regarding deliverability.  These statutes, along with the regulations interpreting the statutes, generally are intended to prevent waste of oil and natural gas, and to protect correlative rights to produce oil and natural gas by assigning allowable rates of production to each well or proration unit.
 
The exploration, development, production and processing of oil and natural gas are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations to protect the environment.  Various federal and state agencies are considering, and some have adopted, other laws and regulations regarding environmental controls that could increase the cost of doing business.  These laws and regulations may require: the acquisition of permits by operators before drilling commences; the prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness areas or where pollution arises; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling operations, particularly operations in offshore waters or on submerged lands.  The cost of oil and natural gas development and production also may increase because of the cost of compliance with such legislation and regulations, together with any penalties resulting from failing to comply with the legislation and regulations.  Ultimately, Royale Energy may bear some of these costs.
 
Presently, Royale Energy does not anticipate that compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or its competitive position in the oil and natural gas industry; however, changes in the laws, rules or regulations, or the interpretation thereof, could have a materially adverse effect on Royale Energy’s financial condition or results of operation.
