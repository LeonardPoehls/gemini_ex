Overview 
 Quotient Technology Inc., is a provider of an industry leading digital platform that enables consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands and retailers to engage shoppers through personalized and targeted promotions and media. Through our platform, CPGs and retailers are able to use online and in-store point-of-sale (POS) shopper data and analytics to drive sales with improved efficiency, as compared to traditional offline promotional and advertising vehicles. 
 We operate our platform across a broad distribution network, reaching over 40 million shoppers at critical moments in their paths to purchase. Our network includes our website and mobile properties of our flagship consumer brand, Coupons.com, as well as our other owned and operated properties, and thousands of our publisher partners. In addition, we operate our platform, Retailer iQ, on a co-branded or white label basis with our retailer partners, providing them a digital platform to directly engage their shoppers across their websites, mobile, ecommerce, and social channels. Retailer iQ integrates with retailers’ POS technology and leverages a broad set of shopper insights, including online behaviors, purchase, and purchase intent data to drive personalized and targeted promotions and media. Retailers using Retailer iQ are primarily in the grocery, drug, dollar, club and mass merchandise channels where the majority of CPG products are sold.
 Our network is made up of three constituencies: 
  
• | Over 2,000 brands from approximately 700 CPGs;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | Retailers across multiple classes of trade such as grocery, drug, dollar, club, and mass merchandise channels; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumers visiting our web, mobile properties, social channels, as well as those of our CPGs, retailers, and publishing partners.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The relationship between our CPGs, retailers, publishers and shoppers, has resulted in a network effect, which we believe gives us a significant competitive advantage over both offline and other online competitors. As our shopper audience increases, our platform becomes more valuable to CPGs and retailers, which, in turn, rely more heavily on our platform for their digital promotions and media. In addition, the breadth of content offered from these leading brands enables us to attract and retain more retailers, publishers and shoppers. As our network expands, we generate more shopper data and insights, which improve our ability to deliver more relevant and personalized promotions and media.
 We primarily generate revenue by providing digital promotions and media solutions to our customers. Our customers include approximately 700 CPG companies and include many of the leading food, beverage, drug, personal and household product manufacturers. Together, these CPG companies represent over 2,000 brands.

Our retailer partners include leading grocery, drug, dollar, club and mass merchandise retailers which distribute and accept coupons through Quotient. Our retailers also include a broad range of specialty stores, including clothing, electronics, home improvement and many others which offer coupon codes through our platform. 
 We generate promotion revenues from digital transactions on our network. Each time a consumer activates a digital coupon on our platform we are generally paid a fee. Activation of a digital coupon can include: printing it for physical redemption at a retailer, saving it to a retailer loyalty account for automatic digital redemption, or using a mobile device to scan a retailer receipt with the appropriate purchase for automatic digital redemption and cash back. As our business evolves, we will continue to experiment with different pricing models and fee arrangements with CPGs and retailers which may impact how we monetize transactions. Promotion revenues includes coupon codes in which we are generally paid a fee when a consumer makes a purchase using a coupon code from our platform. We generally pay a distribution fee to retailers or publishers when a consumer activates a digital promotion on their website or mobile app. These distribution fees are included in our cost of revenues. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – “Non-GAAP Financial Measure and Key Operating Metrics” for more information.
 We also generate media revenue from CPGs, advertising agencies, and retailers through the placement of online advertisements that are displayed on our websites and mobile apps, as well as those of our publishers, retailers and other third parties.
 During 2016, we generated revenues of $275.2 million, representing 16% growth over 2015, and a net loss of $19.5 million as compared to $26.7 million in 2015. See our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes for more information. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, total revenue from The Procter and Gamble Company accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. 
 Our Industry
 For decades, retailers and CPGs have worked together to drive sales, which in turn benefits both parties. CPGs sell their products to retailers, and retailers are responsible for selling those products directly to shoppers. To help retailers attract shoppers and ensure sales, CPGs distribute over 300 billion national brand coupons annually. Historically, the vast majority of these promotions have been distributed in offline channels such as free standing inserts found in Sunday newspapers and direct mail. The effectiveness of these traditional channels, however, has declined due to the drop in newspaper readership coupled with the rise in consumers’ time spent online, particularly on mobile.
 Today, retailers and CPGs are looking for more effective ways to engage shoppers and drive sales. Digital coupons have been found to be more effective and are redeemed at higher rates compared to traditional, offline, promotions. According to an annual industry report by NCH Marketing Services, Inc., in 2015, digital coupons (including digital print and digital paperless coupons) represented less than 1% of total U.S. CPG coupon distribution volume, but accounted for over 10% of total U.S. CPG coupon redemptions. We believe that the ease and simplicity of digital promotions, particularly through mobile, is broadening the demographic reach and driving usage of digital promotions. Further, by shifting traditional offline promotional and media budgets to our digital platform, CPGs are able to use data-driven metrics to better optimize and reach consumers when and how they want to be reached.
 Additionally, CPGs spend approximately $200 billion per year on trade promotions, defined as special promotions offered to a particular retailer to drive additional sales directly from that retailer. These trade promotions have historically been marketed by the retailer in offline vehicles such as aisle tags and printed circulars. As retailers increase their digital marketing efforts, we believe there is an opportunity to drive efficiency within trade promotions. 
 CPGs also spend approximately $34 billion annually in offline and online advertising, with an increased portion of this shifting from offline channels to digital as shoppers spend more of their time online and on mobile devices. eMarketer projects that by 2020, CPG and the consumer products industry digital ad spending will be approximately $9.5 billion, an increase from the approximately $6 billion spent in 2016. By shifting media advertising to online channels, CPGs have more data, insights and behaviors to better target their audiences and optimize spending more efficiently.

Our Solutions 
 We offer an industry leading digital platform that enables CPG brands and retailers to engage shoppers through personalized and targeted promotions and media. Approximately 700 CPGs, representing over 2,000 brands, use our platform to manage and distribute promotional offers, target shopper audiences, and target and display media advertising. 
 We enable CPG brands and retailers to connect with shoppers and help drive sales. Through the platform, brands and retailers can manage their national brand promotions, trade promotions and media advertising together, combining shopper insights and purchase data with broad distribution capabilities across mobile, web, and social channels. We also enable brands and retailers to develop marketing and promotional programs within days, with the added flexibility of adjusting programs in real time. This differs from the long lead times typically required in traditional offline marketing vehicles. Our platform delivers value as a stand- alone promotions or media offering, but also provides additional value when used collectively. 
 We have a broad distribution network including our owned and operated web and mobile properties, such as Coupons.com, and thousands of publishing and retailer partner sites. Promotions can be saved directly to a retailer loyalty card and redeemed at checkout, redeemed for cash back through our mobile receipt scanning feature, or printed and taken directly to the store for physical redemption. 
 Retailer iQ is used at top retailers in the grocery, drug, dollar and mass merchandise channels and is a co-branded or white-labeled solution that powers retailer websites, ecommerce experiences, mobile websites and mobile applications. Retailer iQ integrates into retailers’ points-of-sale (POS) and serves as their digital marketing platform, distributing personalized and targeted promotions and media to help drive shopper loyalty and increased sales. Retailer iQ also includes features around digital grocery list, digital receipt, digital circular and beacon technology. 
 Quotient Promotions
 We offer digital paperless and digital print promotions through our Quotient Promotions Network (also known as our Digital Free Standing Insert Network). With digital print, shoppers select coupons and print them from their desktop or mobile device to redeem in store. With digital paperless, shoppers save coupons directly to retailer loyalty accounts for automatic digital redemption, or by redeeming coupons using a mobile device for cash back after taking a picture of a retailer receipt with the appropriate purchase.
 Through our platform, CPGs and retailers are able to reach shoppers on the web and on mobile devices by offering digital coupons through our extensive network which includes:
  
• | the Coupons.com website and our Coupons.com and Shopmium mobile application platforms;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CPG and retailer websites and mobile applications, either hosted by us or hosted by them using our APIs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the websites and mobile applications of thousands of registered partner sites included in our publisher network.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have designed and engineered our platform to support personalization, targeting and optimization in the delivery of digital coupons. We start with demographic and geography based personalization techniques to ensure that consumers see and can easily access the most relevant content. We personalize content based on which offers the consumer has clicked on and what searches the consumer may conduct on our network as well as the coupons that the consumer previously activated, and redeemed. We also offer targeted promotions based on the criteria listed above, combined with data from our Retailer iQ integrations with select retailers. We offer a receipt-scanning, cash-back mobile coupon for direct cash back upon taking a picture of a retailer receipt with the appropriate purchase.
 Retailer iQ allows retailers to integrate our digital promotions with their loyalty programs and point of sale systems for digital paperless delivery. Retailer iQ provides a personalized consumer experience to help retailers and brands drive loyalty and engagement with their shoppers. By integrating with the retailer point-of-sale system, our solution leverages data available across various touchpoints including web, mobile and customer channels such as email, and point of sale purchase data. Using data, the platform allows for real-time recommendations of digital coupons and products, real-time reporting, targeting and analytics, targeted media, and digital receipts, all of which help retailers and brands communicate with and influence their shoppers, primarily through their mobile phones.

Our promotions and media solutions are designed for mobile channels to further drive consumer adoption and engagement across our platform. Retailer iQ, for instance, powers retailer mobile applications and websites to enable consumers to download coupons, create shopping lists, and search for offers while on the go. CPGs can target Retailer iQ shoppers to personalize brand engagement or provide brand information. Our Coupons.com mobile application allows consumers to access our digital coupons and coupon codes, and is designed to provide personalized and location-based content. Our Shopmium receipt-scanning, cash-back mobile application platform allows consumers to use a CPG promotion by taking a picture of a receipt and uploading it to Quotient, where we validate the purchase against the promotion, and make payment to the consumer directly to a bank or PayPal account.
 Quotient Media  
 We offer media solutions that provide CPGs, retailers and other advertisers access to our audience. Brands buy media with us to reach shoppers before, during and after their shopping cycles. Furthermore, we allow CPGs and retailers to take advantage of additional promotional opportunities to highlight their brands including premier media and advertising placements on our site, promoted positions within our coupon galleries and premium placement in our marketing efforts.
 We also offer a targeted, data-driven solution, through Quotient Media Exchange, where advertisers can leverage Quotient’s reach and exclusive data to serve targeted media across the web and mobile. Through our Quotient Insights Platform, we combine purchase data from select retailers across the Quotient Retailer iQ network with online engagement and purchase-intent data from Quotient’s flagship brand, Coupons.com, and the Company’s thousands of publishing partners. This enables advertisers to reach a national audience or a single retailer’s customers using our solution. Our data processing systems are able to provide consumer intent signals to various advertising networks to extend our reach, which effectively increases media sales. Our media solutions can reach shoppers throughout our network, including Retailer iQ, and across web, mobile and social channels. For example, we can target consumers on Facebook who have used a particular category of coupon with media for that category of product. The quality and real-time nature of our data network enables us to offer relevant and targeted media campaigns. As our platform, network and audience expands, the value of our data and analytics increases.
 Publishing Channels
 Our platform includes numerous tools to enhance the effectiveness of promotions, media and analytics, and drive increased monetization through our platform. These tools are used by us, as well as our CPG, retailer and publisher partners.
 Brandcaster®.    Our Brandcaster technology powers our affiliate program by enabling third-party publishers to easily display our promotions and media to visitors on their sites. Brandcaster’s easy-to-use self-service platform allows publishers to produce a look and feel customized to their brand and earn revenues for the coupons that are activated on their site and for media impressions.
 CLIP.    Our Content Layout and Integration Platform, or CLIP, is a set of proprietary web services designed for publishers who want greater control and flexibility managing the presentation and application flow of coupons and content in their own website environment. CLIP provides more customization options than our Brandcaster program, and is designed to provide greater flexibility in developing rich and seamless user experiences that meet the growing needs of publisher web sites. We generally provide additional consulting and implementation services for publishers who use CLIP.
 Emails.    We deliver personalized emails with coupon offers and digital circular offers to shoppers based on their purchase behavior and intent, or interaction with our site. Shoppers who receive emails with personalized promotional content include registered users on our Coupons.com site and those of our Retailer iQ retailers.
 Social.    We enable CPGs to distribute coupons on their Facebook pages in a seamless and fully customizable solution through an API on our platform. They then can manage the look and feel of the experience for consumers. Typically, CPGs will use coupons as an incentive for consumers to “like” their Facebook pages and brands and our application handles the process and tracking.
 Bricks.    Our Bricks services include coupons and mobile cash rebate offers that operate just like the digital offers that we distribute on Coupons.com and across the Quotient Promotions Network, but the CPG is responsible for setting up and driving distribution. For example, our Bricks service may enable a CPG to make available a specific coupon on their website. CPGs are able to leverage our technology to facilitate the printing, digital receipt scan and rebate, and tracking of offers in a secure manner, but the CPG distributes the coupon through its own distribution process such as an email campaign or as part of a special promotion on their site.

Growth Strategy 
 We intend to grow our platform and our business through the following key strategies:
 Increase revenues from CPGs already on our platform.    Based on our experience to date, we believe we have opportunities to continue increasing revenues from our existing CPG customer base through:
  
• | increasing our share of CPG spending on overall coupons and trade promotions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increasing the number of brands that are using our platform within each CPG;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increasing media spending on our platform and our network;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | leveraging our data to provide more targeted promotions, media, and analytics; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maximizing consumer’s experiences across all products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 Expand our network through Retailer iQ, our digital paperless platform.    By using our platform to aggregate and optimize data, CPGs and retailers are able to offer personalized and targeted consumer experiences to more effectively engage consumers and drive sales. By bringing retailers and shoppers onto Retailer iQ, we are able to grow our digital paperless offering and distribution reach, and further leverage consumer insights from the platform. We believe as we continue to expand our network through Retailer iQ and increased shopper adoption, the value we provide to CPGs and retailers increases, as well as the opportunity to increase our share of CPG spending from promotions, trade spend and media budgets. We intend to continue to invest in technologies and product offerings that further integrate digital promotions and media into the retailer channel, and specifically within our Retailer iQ platform. 
 Grow our current customer base and add new industry segments.    We believe we have the opportunity to grow the number of brands and retailers that we serve, thereby increasing the value of our platform to all constituents. In addition, we intend to continue growing our business with other manufacturers and retailers in new industry segments such as convenience and specialty/franchise retail, restaurants and entertainment venues.
 Grow shopper adoption and engagement of our digital offerings.    We plan to continue to innovate and invest across our platform, including Retailer iQ, mobile solutions, media, digital promotion offerings, Coupons.com mobile app, and within our specialty/franchise retail business. We plan to continue helping our Retailer iQ partners launch and market the platform in order to generate and increase shopper adoption and engagement of digital paperless promotions. We believe that CPG spending on digital promotions and marketing will continue to grow as point of sale, mobile channels and social media offer new opportunities to engage consumers on their path to purchase. 
 Grow our media business.     We plan to grow our media business, including Quotient Media Exchange, by continuing to invest in our media solutions, including enhancements to our targeting and reporting capabilities and expanded use of our proprietary data as well as data from select exclusive retailer partnerships. We also plan to scale our network through new and expanded partnerships, new verticals, and third parties such as media agencies.
 Expand and grow Quotient Insights, and our emerging products around data and analytics.    As our network, content pool and shopper audience expands, resulting in greater data and insights, we believe that our platform will become more valuable. We expect to introduce new, more robust, solutions to our customers around analytics and insights. Our targeted promotion offering and Quotient Media Exchange, are just two examples of how we use the platform to drive more value across the network. We also have the growing capability to directly link digital campaigns and media to in-store purchase data. We believe we are in a unique position to deliver new products around data and analytics, and the opportunity to grow Quotient Insights increases as we continue to expand.
 Grow international operations.    Many CPGs and retailers on our platform have global operations and we believe that we can opportunistically grow our operations and offerings in existing international markets and partner with our existing clients to enter new geographies in which they operate. We also plan to leverage our existing presence in France, through our acquisition of Shopmium, a receipt-scanning, cash-back mobile application platform, to broaden our international opportunity beginning with the United Kingdom.
 Selectively pursue strategic acquisitions.   We intend to continue pursuing selective acquisition and partnership opportunities that we believe can expand our business.

Security 
 Our platform includes a proprietary digital distribution management system to enable CPGs and retailers to securely control the number of coupons distributed by device. We have controls in place to limit the number of digital coupons that can be printed. Similar controls are in place for linking coupons to loyalty cards and other paperless solutions, which allows us to limit the number of coupons distributed and activated. In addition, each printed coupon carries a unique ID that is encrypted, enabling us to trace each coupon from print to redemption. All of our digital print coupons can be authenticated and validated using this unique code. This unique ID also can be used to detect counterfeit or altered coupons. Our platform allows us to systematically identify and respond to fraudulent and prohibited activities by restricting a device from printing coupons.Sales and Marketing 
 We have a team of dedicated, skilled specialists focused on CPGs and retailers. Based on our 18 years of execution for some of the world’s largest CPGs and retailers, we believe that our sales, integration, promotions management and customer support capabilities are difficult to replicate and a key reason for the growth of our business. Much of our sales activity is focused on expanding the number of brands within our existing CPG customers that offer digital promotions and media through our platform as well as expanding the volume of offers made by the brands currently using our platform. In addition to seeking new CPG and retailer customers, we are focused on continuing to increase the size and breadth of our publisher network. We are also seeking to partner with CPGs and other manufacturers and retailers in new industry segments such as convenience and specialty/franchise retail, restaurants and entertainment venues.
 In addition to sales support during the campaign planning process, our sales representatives provide additional support to CPGs and retailers to ensure that their campaigns are launched and delivered within specified timeframes. Representatives assigned to specific customers review performance metrics and share feedback with the advertiser.
 We are focused on managing our brand, increasing market awareness and generating new advertiser leads. In doing so, we often present at industry conferences, create custom events and invest in public relations. In addition, our marketing team advertises online, in print and in other forms of media, creates case studies, sponsors research, publishes marketing collateral and undertakes customer research studies.
 Technology and Infrastructure 
 Since inception, we have made significant investments and will continue to invest in developing our differentiated and proprietary platforms aimed at solving the problems of CPGs and retailers in ways that traditional solutions cannot. We are focused on offering solutions that provide measurable results. We have assembled a team of highly skilled engineers and computer scientists with deep expertise across a broad range of relevant disciplines. Key focus areas of our engineering team include: 
  
• | Scalable infrastructure. We use a combination of proprietary and open-source software to achieve a horizontally scalable, global, distributed and fault-tolerant architecture, with the goal of enabling us to ensure the continuity of our business, regardless of local disruptions. Our computational infrastructure currently processes millions of events per day and is designed in a way that enables us to add significant capacity to our platform as we scale our business without requiring any material design or architecture modifications. Our private cloud technology infrastructure is hosted across data centers in co-location facilities in California, Nevada, and Virginia. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Redundancy. Our production infrastructure utilizes a hot failover configuration which allows us to switch server loads, be it a single server or an entire data center, to the other data center within minutes. Data is continuously replicated between sites, and multiple copies at each site provide fast recovery whenever it is requested. Each data center has been designed to handle more than our entire server needs, which enables us to perform platform maintenance, business resumption and disaster recovery without any customer impact. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reporting. Our user interface provides flexible reporting and interactive visualization of the key drivers of success for each media campaign. We use these reporting and visualization products internally to manage campaigns and provide advertisers with campaign insights. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Security. Our security policy adheres to established policies to ensure that all data, code, and production infrastructure are secure and protected. Our data centers are SSAE 16 Type II certified and we are PCI DSS compliant where required. We use our internal team and third parties to test, audit, and review our entire production environment to protect it. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our research and development expenses were $50.5 million, $48.4 million and $49.6 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We capitalized internal-use software development costs of $0.7 million, $1.5 million and $3.6 million during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
 Competition 
 We compete against a variety of different businesses with respect to different aspects of our business, including: 
  
• | traditional offline coupon and discount services, as well as newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that provide coupon promotions and discounts on products and services in free standing inserts or other forms, including Valassis Communications, Inc., News America Marketing Interactive, Inc. and Catalina Marketing Corporation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | providers of digital coupons such as Valassis’ Redplum.com, Catalina Marketing Corporation’s Cellfire, Inmar, News America Marketing’s SmartSource, YouTech, and companies that offer coupon codes such as RetailMeNot, Inc., Groupon Inc., Exponential Interactive Inc.’s TechBargains, Savings.com, Inc. and Ebates Performance Marketing, Inc., companies that offer cash back solutions such as iBotta, Inc., News America Marketing’s Checkout 51, and companies providing other e-commerce based services that allow consumers to obtain direct or indirect discounts on purchases;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | internet sites that are focused on specific communities or interests that offer coupons or discount arrangements related to such communities or interests;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | companies offering online and marketing services to retailers and CPGs, such as MyWebGrocer, Inc. and Flipp Corporation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | companies offering media services, such as Triad Media Inc. and RichRelevance, Inc.; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | retailers marketing and offering their own digital coupons directly to consumers using their own websites, email newsletters and alerts, mobile applications and social media channels.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the principal factors that generally determine a company’s competitive advantage in our market include the following: 
  
• | scale and effectiveness of reach in connecting CPGs and retailers to consumers in a digital manner, through web, mobile and other online properties;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to attract consumers to use digital coupons;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | platform security, scalability, reliability and availability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | number of channels by which a company engages with consumers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | integration of products and solutions;
--+---------------------------------------


• | rapid deployment of products and services for customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | breadth, quality and relevance of the Company’s digital coupons;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to deliver digital coupons that are widely available and easy to use in consumers’ preferred form;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | integration with retailer applications;
--+----------------------------------------


• | brand recognition;
--+-------------------


• | quality of tools, reporting and analytics for planning, development and optimization of promotions; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | breadth and expertise of the Company’s sales organization.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 While we believe we compete effectively with respect to the factors identified above, we may face increasing competition from larger or more established companies that seek to enter our market or from smaller companies that launch new products, solutions and services that could gain market acceptance.

Culture and Employees 
 We are proud of our company culture and consider it to be one of our competitive strengths. Our culture helps drive our business and compete for talented employees in a highly competitive market. We seek to offer an environment that allows our employees to thrive and grow. 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 662 full-time employees, consisting of 505 employees in the United States and 157 employees internationally.
Intellectual Property 
 We protect our intellectual property by relying on federal, state, and common law rights in the United States and equivalent rights in other jurisdictions, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology and algorithms by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties.
 In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. As of December 31, 2016, we hold or have exclusive rights to 23 issued patents in the United States and 9 patents that have been issued outside of the United States with terms expiring between 2018 and 2034. 
 Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective or may require significant expenditures and other resources to enforce. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could harm our business and our operating results, or ability to compete.
 Companies in Internet-related and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have been subject to in the past, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
