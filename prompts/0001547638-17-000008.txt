Item 1. | Business

The following discussion of our business provides information regarding our principal gathering, transportation, processing, NGL fractionation and other assets. For a discussion of our results of operations, please read Part II, Item 7 of this report.
General Overview
Southcross Energy Partners, L.P. (the "Partnership," "Southcross," "we," "our" or "us") is a Delaware limited partnership formed in April 2012. Our common units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SXE." We are a master limited partnership, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, that provides natural gas gathering, processing, treating, compression and transportation services and NGL fractionation and transportation services. We also source, purchase, transport and sell natural gas and NGLs. Our assets are located in South Texas, Mississippi and Alabama and include two gas processing plants, one fractionation facility and gathering and transportation pipelines.
Southcross Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Holdings”), indirectly owns 100% of Southcross Energy Partners GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, our general partner (“General Partner”) (and therefore controls us), all of our subordinated and Class B convertible units (the "Class B Convertible Units") and 54.6% of our common units. Our General Partner owns an approximate 2.0% interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights.
Following the emergence of Holdings from its Chapter 11 reorganization proceeding on April 13, 2016 (as discussed below), EIG Global Energy Partners, LLC (“EIG”) and Tailwater Capital LLC (“Tailwater”) (collectively, the “Sponsors”) each indirectly own approximately one-third of Holdings, and a group of consolidated lenders under Holdings' term loan (the "Lenders") own the remaining one-third of Holdings.
Recent Developments
Amendments to the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement
On July 25, 2016, we determined Holdings’ cash contribution to us for the first quarter 2016 equity cure had not been transferred to us timely, as required under the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo, N.A., UBS Securities LLC, Barclays Bank PLC and a syndicate of lenders (the "Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement"), as amended in May 2015, due to an administrative oversight, which resulted in a default. On July 26, 2016, Holdings fully funded the first quarter 2016 equity cure. On August 4, 2016, we entered into a limited waiver and second amendment to the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement whereby the lenders waived any default or right to exercise any remedy as a result of this technical event of default to fund timely the first quarter 2016 equity cure.
On November 8, 2016, we entered into a limited waiver and third amendment to the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement (the “Third Amendment”), which stipulated, among other things, that (i) the equity cure funding deadline for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (“Q3 2016 Equity Cure”) was extended from November 23, 2016 to December 16, 2016, and (ii) limited the total revolving credit exposure. On December 9, 2016, we entered into the waiver and fourth amendment to the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Fourth Amendment"), which stipulated, among other things, that (i) the deadline for funding the Q3 2016 Equity Cure was further extended from December 16, 2016 to January 12, 2017, and (ii) the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement was amended to require that any account into which we deposit funds, securities or commodities be subject to a lien and control agreement for the benefit of the secured parties under the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement.
On December 29, 2016, we entered into the waiver and fifth amendment to the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement (the “Fifth Amendment”), pursuant to which we received a full waiver for all defaults or events of default arising out of our failure to comply with the financial covenant to maintain a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio less than 5.00 to 1.00 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.
Additionally, pursuant to the Fifth Amendment, (i) total aggregate commitments under the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement were reduced from $200 million to $145 million and the sublimit for letters of credit also was reduced from $75 million to $50 million (total aggregate commitments will be further reduced periodically through December 31, 2018); (ii) the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (each of which is defined in the Fifth Amendment) financial covenants were suspended until the quarter ended March 31, 2019; (iii) the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Fifth Amendment) financial covenant requirement was reduced from 2.50 to 1.00 to 1.50 to 1.00 for all periods ending on or prior to December 31, 2018 (the “Ratio Compliance Date”). Prior to the Ratio Compliance 
6

Date, we are required to maintain minimum levels of Consolidated EBITDA on a quarterly basis and are subject to certain covenants and restrictions related to liquidity and capital expenditures. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.
In connection with the execution of the Fifth Amendment, on December 29, 2016, the Partnership entered into (i) an Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with Holdings and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., (ii) a Backstop Commitment Letter (the “Backstop Agreement”) with Holdings, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and the Sponsors and (iii) a First Amendment to Equity Cure Contribution Agreement (the “Equity Cure Contribution Amendment”) with Holdings. Pursuant to the Equity Cure Contribution Amendment, on December 29, 2016, Holdings contributed $17.0 million to us in exchange for 11,486,486 common units. The proceeds of the $17.0 million contribution were used to pay down the outstanding balance under the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes. In addition, pursuant to entering into the Investment Agreement, the previous Equity Cure Contribution Agreement with Holdings terminated and Holdings agreed to contribute $15.0 million to us (the “Committed Amount”) upon the earlier to occur of December 31, 2017 or notification from the Partnership of an event of default under the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement. In exchange for the amounts contributed pursuant to the Investment Agreement upon a Partial Investment Trigger or the Full Investment Trigger (as defined in the Investment Agreement), we will issue to Holdings, at Holdings’ election, either (a) a number of common units at an issue price equal to either (i) if the common units are listed on a national stock exchange, 93% of the volume weighted average price of such common units for the twenty day period immediately preceding the date of the contribution or (ii) if the common units are not listed on a national stock exchange, the fair market value of such common units as reasonably agreed by us and Holdings or (b) a senior unsecured note of the Partnership in an initial face amount equal to the amount of the contribution by Holdings (an “Investment Note”). If Holdings elects to receive an Investment Note in exchange for a contribution pursuant to the Investment Agreement, such Investment Note will mature on or after November 5, 2019 and bear interest at a rate of 12.5% per annum payable in-kind prior to December 31, 2018 and in cash on or after December 31, 2018. The Investment Notes, if any, will be the unsecured obligation of the Partnership subordinate in right of payment to any of the Partnership’s secured obligations under the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement and will contain covenants and events of default no more restrictive than those currently provided in the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement.
Pursuant to the Backstop Agreement, if Holdings is unable to satisfy its obligations under the Investment Agreement with cash on hand upon the occurrence of a Partial Investment Trigger or a Full Investment Trigger, the Sponsors have agreed to fund Holdings’ shortfall in providing the Committed Amount by contributing each Sponsor’s respective pro-rata portion of the shortfall to Holdings or, at the election of each Sponsor, directly to us. As consideration for any amounts contributed directly to us by a Sponsor pursuant to the Backstop Agreement, we will issue to such Sponsor the common units or Investment Note that would have otherwise been issued to Holdings under the Investment Agreement with respect to the amount contributed by the Sponsor.
Based upon the Partnership's financial forecast, amendments to the credit agreement (as discussed above), as well as the $15.0 million additional capital commitment from Holdings and the Sponsors, we believe management's executed plans provide the Partnership with sufficient liquidity to fund future operations through at least twelve months from the date that these financial statements were issued. 
Holdings Chapter 11 Reorganization
On March 28, 2016, Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries (excluding us, our General Partner and our subsidiaries) filed a pre-packaged plan of reorganization (the “POR”) under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the Southern District of Texas to restructure its debt obligations and strengthen its balance sheet. Our operations, customers, suppliers, partners and other constituents were excluded from such proceeding. On April 11, 2016, the bankruptcy court confirmed Holdings’ POR, and on April 13, 2016, Holdings and its subsidiaries emerged from bankruptcy with its Lenders being issued 33.34% of the limited partner interests in Holdings in exchange for the elimination of certain funded debt obligations. EIG and Tailwater each contributed $85 million in cash (or $170 million in the aggregate) in exchange for each Sponsor receiving 33.33% of the limited partner interests in Holdings. In addition, Holdings committed to provide us $50 million (the "Contribution Amount") (as part of an equity cure contribution agreement with Holdings that allowed us to cure any default under applicable financial covenants, set forth in our credit agreement at the time, by having Holdings purchase equity interests in or make capital contributions to us), out of the $170 million in new equity contributed to Holdings from the Sponsors, to provide us with liquidity to comply with the applicable financial covenants set forth in our credit agreement at the time.
Distribution Suspension
The board of directors of our General Partner suspended paying a quarterly distribution with respect to the fourth quarter of 2015 and every quarter of 2016 to reserve any excess cash for the operation of our business. The board of directors of our General Partner and our management believe this suspension to be in the best interest of our unitholders and will continue to 
7

evaluate our ability to reinstate the distribution in future periods. Additionally, we are restricted under the fifth amendment to the Third A&R Revolving Credit Agreement from paying a distribution until our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio is below 5.0. See Notes 2 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
Holdings Drop-Down Acquisition
On May 7, 2015, we acquired gathering, treating, compression and transportation assets (the “2015 Holdings Acquisition”) pursuant to a Purchase, Sale and Contribution Agreement among Holdings, TexStar Midstream Utility, LP, Frio LaSalle Pipeline, LP (“Frio”), us and certain of our subsidiaries. The acquired assets consist of the Valley Wells sour gas gathering and treating system (the “Valley Wells System”), compression assets that are part of the Valley Wells and Lancaster gathering and treating systems (the “Compression Assets”) and two NGL pipelines. Due to the common control aspects in the 2015 Holdings Acquisition, the Partnership’s financial results retrospectively include the financial results for the Valley Wells System and the Compression Assets for all periods ending after August 4, 2014, the date that Southcross Energy LLC and TexStar Midstream Services, LP, a Texas limited partnership (“TexStar”), combined pursuant to a contribution agreement in which Holdings was formed (the “Holdings Transaction”). For additional details regarding the 2015 Holdings Acquisition, see Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the "JOBS Act"). For as long as we are deemed an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements that are generally unavailable to other public companies. These provisions include:

• | an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company's internal controls over financial reporting;


• | an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies;


• | an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; and


• | reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company's executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies.

We have elected to adopt the reduced disclosure requirements described above, except that we have elected to opt out of the exemption that allows emerging growth companies to extend the transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards.
We may take advantage of these provisions until we are no longer an emerging growth company, which will occur on the earliest of:

i. | the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO (December 31, 2017);


ii. | the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues;


iii. | the date on which we have more than $700 million in market value of our common units held by non-affiliates; or

Business Strategy
Our principal business objective is to focus on profitability and improving our business operations by increasing the reliability and efficiency of our assets while managing our costs to ensure the ongoing stability of our business. We expect to achieve this objective by pursuing the following business strategies:

• | Maintain sound financial practices to ensure our long-term viability. We intend to maintain our commitment to financial discipline, including reduction of leverage on our consolidated balance sheet, which we believe will serve the long-term interests of our unitholders. 


• | Continue to enhance the profitability of our existing assets. We intend to increase the profitability of our existing asset base by identifying new business opportunities such as adding new natural gas supplies to our existing gathering and processing assets and pursuing new supplies of NGLs for our fractionation facilities. We have seen an increase in drilling activity around our South Texas assets since the second quarter of 2016 which we believe will lead to improved opportunities for us. 


• | Manage our exposure to commodity price risk. Because natural gas and NGL prices are volatile, we strive to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices and to generate more stable cash flows. We have, and will continue to pursue, a contract portfolio that is weighted towards fixed-fee and fixed-spread contracts, which are not directly sensitive to commodity price levels, while minimizing our direct exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Also, we will consider other methods of limiting commodity exposure, including the use of derivative instruments, as appropriate. 


• | Continue cost savings initiatives. We intend to continue to evaluate and implement cost-saving initiatives, such as consolidation of our Y-grade fractionation, to improve and generate future cash flows.

Competitive Strengths
We believe that we are well-positioned to execute our business strategies successfully by capitalizing on the following competitive strengths:

• | Strategically located asset base. The majority of our assets are located in, or within close proximity to, the Eagle Ford Shale region in South Texas, which is one of the most resource rich drilling regions in the U.S. We operate in Mississippi and Alabama. Also, we believe the growth potential of our South Texas assets coupled with the established, long-lived nature of our Mississippi and Alabama assets provide us with the opportunity to generate growth over the next several years. In addition, all of our assets have access to major natural gas market areas. 


• | South Texas. Our growth opportunities are impacted primarily by natural gas production in the Eagle Ford Shale region. Our Eagle Ford Southcross pipeline catchment area includes multiple prospective production zones, including the Olmos tight sands formation, which overlays the Eagle Ford Shale. Our business activity provides us with relationships with producers in the South Texas region and an understanding of their future development plans and infrastructure needs. In addition, our South Texas systems benefit from access to the large industrial market for both natural gas and NGLs in and around the Corpus Christi area. 


• | Mississippi and Alabama. We are a leading service provider in the Mississippi and Alabama regions in which we operate. Our assets provide critical supply to our industrial, commercial and power generation customers and the 

9

wholesale markets via intrastate and interstate pipeline interconnects. Several of the large, gas-fired power plants across the southern portion of Mississippi access their primary source of natural gas through our system.

• | Reliable cash flows underpinned by long-term, fixed-fee and fixed-spread contracts. We provide our services primarily under fixed-fee and fixed-spread contracts, which help to promote cash flow reliability and minimize our direct exposure to commodity price fluctuations. 


• | Integrated South Texas midstream value chain. We provide a comprehensive package of services to natural gas producers and customers including natural gas gathering, processing, treating, compression and transportation and NGL fractionation and transportation. We believe our ability to move natural gas and NGLs from the wellhead to market provides us with several advantages in competing for new supplies of natural gas. Specifically, the integrated nature of our business allows us to provide multiple services related to a single supply of natural gas and take advantage of incremental opportunities that present themselves along the value chain. Providing multiple services to customers also gives us a better understanding of each customer's needs and the marketplace. In addition to the advantages with our producers and customers, our ability to source and transport natural gas to market also allows us to satisfy our commercial and industrial customers' demand for natural gas. We believe all of these factors provide a competitive advantage relative to companies which do not offer this range of midstream services. 


• | Experienced and incentivized management and operating teams. Our senior executives have worked in several energy companies. Our executive officers have extensive experience in building, acquiring and managing midstream and other energy assets and are focused on optimizing our existing business and expanding our operations through disciplined development and accretive acquisitions. Many of our field operating managers and supervisors have long-standing experience operating our assets. 


• | Supportive Sponsors with significant industry expertise. Our Sponsors are the principal owners of Holdings, which is the owner of our General Partner and the indirect beneficial owner of 54.6% of our common units, and have substantial experience as private equity investors in the energy and midstream sectors. Our Sponsors' investment professionals have deep experience in identifying, evaluating, negotiating and financing acquisitions and investments in the midstream sector. We believe that our Sponsors provide us with strategic guidance, financial expertise and capital support that enhance our ability to grow our asset base and cash flow.

(1) | On August 4, 2016, the Gregory facility was idled and converted to a compressor station by December 31, 2016. The assets at the Gregory facility that will not be used as part of the compressor station will be sold or scrapped. The gas previously processed at the Gregory facility was re-routed through our integrated system and is now being processed at our Woodsboro processing facility.


(2) | On July 29, 2016, we notified our producers that the Conroe plant would be shut down. The Conroe plant was shut down by December 31, 2016 and currently is being dismantled.

In connection with our acquisition of TexStar Rich Gas System, we acquired equity interests in three joint ventures, including T2 Eagle Ford Gathering Company LLC (“T2 Eagle Ford”), T2 LaSalle Gathering Company LLC (“T2 LaSalle”) and T2 EF Cogeneration Holdings LLC (“T2 Cogen”), which operate pipelines and a cogeneration facility located in South Texas. We indirectly own a 50% interest in T2 Eagle Ford, a 50% interest in T2 Cogen and a 25% interest in T2 LaSalle. T2 Cogen operates two gas powered turbines that buy fuel from related parties and charges such parties based on monthly electrical activity. The following table provides information regarding our pipeline joint venture investments, T2 Eagle Ford and T2 LaSalle, for the year ended December 31, 2016:

 | As of December 31, 2016
Joint venture pipelines | Miles | Leased Capacity | | Average throughput volumes of natural gas (MMcf/d)(1)

Residue Header | 76 | | 50 | % | 269
Total | 260 | | | 

(1) Average throughput volumes of natural gas calculated for the entire year ended December 31, 2016.
We derive revenue primarily from fixed-fee and fixed-spread arrangements. Our contracts vary in duration from one month to several years and the duration and pricing of our contracts vary depending upon several factors, including our 
11

competitive position, our acceptance of risks associated with longer-term contracts, and our desire to recoup over the term of a contract any capital expenditures that we are required to incur in order to provide service to our customers.
We continually seek new sources of natural gas supply and end use markets to increase the gas throughput volume on our gathering and pipeline systems and through our processing plants and compression assets.
The NGL products we produce have a variety of applications, including as heating fuels, petrochemical feedstocks and refining blend stocks. Our NGL products and the demand for these products are affected as follows: 

• | Ethane. Ethane is typically supplied as purity ethane or as part of an ethane-propane mix. Ethane is used primarily in the petrochemical industry as feedstock for ethylene, one of the basic building blocks for a wide range of plastics and other chemical products. Although ethane typically is extracted as part of the mixed NGL stream at gas processing plants, if natural gas prices increase significantly in relation to NGL product prices or if the demand for ethylene falls, it may be more profitable for natural gas processors to leave the ethane in the natural gas stream thereby reducing the volume of NGLs delivered for fractionation and marketing. 


• | Propane. Propane is used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and propylene, as a heating, engine and industrial fuel, and in agricultural applications such as crop drying. Changes in demand for ethylene and propylene could adversely affect demand for propane. In addition, U.S. demand for propane as a heating fuel is affected significantly by weather conditions. The volume of propane sold in the U.S. typically is at its highest during the six-month peak heating season of October through March. Demand for propane may be reduced during periods of warmer-than-normal weather.


• | Normal Butane. Normal butane is used in the production of isobutane, as a refined product blending component, as a fuel gas and in the production of ethylene and propylene. U.S. demand for normal butane as a refined product blending component is at its highest in September through February. Changes in the composition of refined products resulting from governmental regulation, changes in feedstocks, products and economics, demand for heating fuel and for ethylene and propylene could affect demand for normal butane adversely.


• | Isobutane. Isobutane is used predominantly in refineries to produce alkylates to enhance octane levels. Accordingly, any action that reduces demand for motor gasoline or demand for isobutane to produce alkylates for octane enhancement could reduce demand for isobutane.


• | Natural Gasoline. Natural gasoline is used as a blending component for certain refined products and as a feedstock used in the production of ethylene and propylene. Changes in the mandated composition resulting from governmental regulation of motor gasoline and in demand for ethylene and propylene could affect demand for natural gasoline adversely.

NGLs and products produced from NGLs also compete with global markets. Any reduced demand for ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane or natural gasoline in the markets we access for any of the reasons stated above could affect demand for the services we provide adversely as well as NGL prices, which would impact negatively our results of operations and financial condition. 
South Texas
The assets in our South Texas region are located between Montgomery County which is north of Houston, and Webb and Dimmit Counties near the Texas-Mexico border. As of December 31, 2016, these assets consisted of approximately 2,011 miles of pipeline ranging in diameter from 2 to 24 inches, our Woodsboro processing plant, our Bonnie View NGL fractionation facility, our Lone Star processing plant, our Valley Wells System and 20 compression stations.
The majority of our pipelines in South Texas feed rich gas from multiple producing fields, including the Eagle Ford Shale, to our processing and NGL fractionation facilities at Lone Star, Woodsboro and Bonnie View. The residue gas pipelines from our processing plants and the remaining pipelines in lean gas service in South Texas are used to serve multiple industrial and electric generation customers, and to deliver gas to a number of intrastate and interstate pipelines. Holdings owns approximately 600 miles of gathering pipeline in Frio and LaSalle counties and the Robstown fractionator ("Robstown") to which all or our assets are connected. 
Our Woodsboro processing plant is a 200 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant located in Refugio County, Texas. Our Bonnie View NGL fractionation plant, also in Refugio County, Texas has a capacity of 22,500 Bbls/d. In June 2015, we completed the NGL pipelines, which include a Y-grade pipeline that connects our Woodsboro processing facility to Robstown 
12

and a propane pipeline from our Bonnie View fractionator to Robstown. The installation of the NGL pipelines resulted in our ability to sell incremental Y-grade to Holdings and mitigated the financial impact of the capacity reductions at Bonnie View.
Our Lone Star processing plant is a 300 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant located in Bee County, Texas, and was acquired from TexStar in August 2014. The plant is interconnected with other South Texas rich gas supply basins and Woodsboro via our Bee Line pipeline which was placed into service in 2013. 
Our Gregory processing plant was a cryogenic processing plant comprised of two units collectively having a total capacity of 135 MMcf/d, and a fractionator having total capacity of 4,800 BBls/d. This plant processed natural gas from both a local gathering system and from sources elsewhere on our South Texas pipeline systems until we determined, as part of cost-cutting initiatives, to idle the plant in August 2016 and shut it down and convert the site into a compressor station by December 31, 2016. The natural gas that previously was sent to Gregory has been diverted to our newer, more efficient, Woodsboro plant. The conversion of the Gregory plant resulted in operating expense and capital expense savings. 
On January 20, 2015, our Gregory processing plant experienced a fire which caused damage to one of our two processing plants, taking all 135 MMcf/d of processing capacity temporarily out of service. In February 2015, we started one of the Gregory plants and operated it until it was permanently idled in August 2016. In December 2016, we reached a settlement related to the Gregory processing plant fire with our insurance carriers. We received the payment of $2.0 million from our insurance carriers in the first quarter of 2017 and used a portion of the proceeds to pay down on our term loan.
Our Conroe processing plant and gathering system is a 50 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas plant. The processing plant and gathering system operated together north of Houston in Montgomery County, Texas to gather and process natural gas. We had a mixture of fixed-fee and percent of proceeds processing contracts with producers, under which the majority of the residue gas from the Conroe plant was returned to the producers for gas lift purposes. We sold the remaining residue gas and NGLs to unaffiliated parties. 
We decided to shut down the Conroe facility as part of company-wide cost-cutting initiatives. On July 29, 2016, we notified our producers that the Conroe plant was going to be shut down by year end. As of December 31, 2016, the Conroe plant was shut down and currently is being dismantled.
Our Valley Wells System, located in LaSalle County, Texas, has sour gas treating capacity of approximately 100 MMcf/d and is supported by a 60 MMcf/d minimum volume commitment from Holdings for gathering and treating services, while Holdings has producer contracts with minimum volume commitments totaling 35 MMcf/d behind the system. The system is connected to our rich gas system for transport and processing.
Mississippi and Alabama
The assets in our Mississippi region are located principally in the southern half of the state and comprise the largest intrastate pipeline system in Mississippi. The Mississippi assets consist of approximately 605 miles of pipeline, ranging in diameter from 2 to 20 inches with an estimated design capacity of 345 MMcf/d, and two treating plants. Our system throughput volumes in Mississippi are affected by both on-system gas production volumes and customers' demand for gas. The system has the capability to receive natural gas from three unaffiliated interstate pipelines—Southeast Supply Header, Southern Natural Gas Company and Texas Eastern Company—to supplement supply on the system or to market gas off the system.
The assets in our Alabama region are located in northwest and central Alabama and consist of 492 miles of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines ranging from 2 to 16 inches in diameter with an estimated design capacity of 375 MMcf/d. The primary gas supply to the system is coal bed methane gas from the Black Warrior Basin with incremental volumes gathered from conventional gas wells. The system receives natural gas from unaffiliated interstate pipelines and services markets along the system.
Competition
The natural gas gathering, compression, processing, transportation and marketing business and the NGL fractionation business are highly competitive. Our competitors include other midstream companies, producers and intrastate and interstate pipelines. Competition for natural gas volumes is based primarily on commercial terms, reliability, service levels, flexibility, access to markets, location, available capacity, connection costs and fuel efficiencies. Our principal competitors are DCP Midstream LLC, Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., Enterprise Products Partners LP, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, Kinder Morgan Inc. and Targa Pipeline Partners, L.P.
In addition to competing for natural gas supply volumes, we face competition for customer markets in selling residue gas and NGLs. Competition is based primarily on the proximity of pipelines to the markets, price and assurance of supply.

Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk
Our markets are in Texas, Alabama and Mississippi and we have a concentration of trade accounts receivable due from customers engaged in the purchase and sale of natural gas and NGL products, and other services. These concentrations of customers may affect our overall credit risk as these customers may be affected similarly by changes in economic, regulatory or other factors. We analyze customers' historical financial and operational information prior to extending credit.
Our top ten customers accounted for 53.5% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. Due to the continued volatility of commodity prices, some of our customers may experience material financial and liquidity issues. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not experience significant nonpayment for services. We had no allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable at December 31, 2016. We recorded an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable of $0.1 million at December, 31, 2015 which was written off in 2016.
Governmental Regulation
We are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (the "NGPSA"), and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (the "PSIA"), which was reauthorized and amended by the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006. The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities, while the PSIA establishes mandatory inspections for all U.S. crude oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in "high-consequence areas". PHMSA has developed regulations implementing the PSIA that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in "high consequence areas," such as high population areas. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the "2011 Pipeline Safety Act"), reauthorized funding for federal pipeline safety programs, increased penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. The Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2016, signed on June 22, 2016, provides funding for the continuation of pipeline safety program revisions initiated under the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act and requires PHMSA to set minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities, authorizes emergency order authority, designates marine coastal areas as unusually environmentally sensitive to pipeline failures and requires additional safety studies that could result in new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines.
PHMSA issued a separate rule that was finalized in January 2017 and is due to be effective on March 24, 2017 that would impose pipeline incident prevention and response measures on pipeline operators. The effective date of this final rule is currently uncertain due to a regulatory freeze implemented by the Trump administration on January 20, 2017. PHMSA also recently published an advisory bulletin providing guidance on verification of records related to pipeline maximum allowable operating pressure. We have performed hydrotests of our facilities to establish the maximum allowable operating pressure and do not expect that any final rulemaking by PHMSA regarding verification of maximum allowable operating pressure would materially affect our operations or revenue. We believe our records relating to allowable maximum operating pressure to be reliable, traceable, verifiable and complete.
Additionally, the National Transportation Safety Board has recently recommended that the PHMSA make a number of changes to its rules, including removing an exemption from most safety inspections for natural gas pipelines installed before 1970. While we cannot predict the outcome of proposed legislative or regulatory initiatives, such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations (such as integrity management requirements) to pipelines and gathering lines not previously subject to such requirements. Further legislative and regulatory changes may also result in higher penalties for the violation of federal pipeline safety regulations. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to become compliant with new requirements, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time the terms of any new laws or rules or the costs of compliance associated with such requirements, but we regularly inspect our pipelines and third parties assist us in interpreting the results of the inspections.
States largely are preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most states are certified by the U.S. Department of Transportation (the "DOT") to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. States may adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines; however, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. State standards may include requirements for facility design and management in addition to requirements for pipelines. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. Our natural gas and natural gas products pipelines have continuous inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements.
14

In addition, we are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (the "OSHA"), and comparable state statutes, the purposes of which are to protect the health and safety of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry; the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that such information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens; the OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals; the Environmental Protection Agency's (the “EPA”) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, also known as the Risk Management Plan requirements, which are designed to prevent the accidental release of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive materials; and the Department of Homeland Security Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, which are designed to regulate the security of high-risk chemical facilities. We do not believe that compliance with these regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows.
Further, exposure to gas containing certain levels of hydrogen sulfide, referred to as sour gas, can be harmful, even fatal, to humans. Some of the gas processed at our sour gas treating and processing facility, as part of the Valley Wells System, contains high levels of hydrogen sulfide. We do not believe that compliance with the applicable federal and state environmental, health and safety laws will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows.
Regulation of Operations
Regulation of pipeline gathering and transportation services, natural gas sales and transportation of NGLs may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our products and services.
Intrastate Pipelines
Our transmission lines are subject to state regulation of rates and terms of service. In Texas, the regulatory system allows rates to be negotiated on a customer-by-customer basis and are subject to a complaint-based review process. In rare circumstances, as allowed by statute, regulators may initiate a rate review. Although Texas does not have an "open access" requirement, there is a "non-discriminatory access" requirement, which is subject to a complaint-based review. In Mississippi and Alabama, the regulatory systems allow special contracts that are negotiated on a customer-by-customer basis for approval by the applicable state commission.
Section 311 Pipelines
Intrastate transportation of natural gas is largely regulated by the state in which such transportation takes place. Several of our intrastate pipeline subsidiaries, Southcross CCNG Transmission Ltd., Southcross Gulf Coast Transmission Ltd., Southcross Mississippi Pipeline, L.P., TexStar Transmission, LP, Southcross Nueces Pipelines LLC and Southcross Alabama Pipeline LLC, also provide interstate transportation services. The rates, terms and conditions of such services are subject to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") jurisdiction under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act ("NGPA"), and Part 284 of FERC's regulations. Pipelines providing certain transportation service under Section 311 are required to provide services on an open and nondiscriminatory basis. The NGPA regulates, among other things, the provision of transportation services by an intrastate natural gas pipeline on behalf of an interstate natural gas pipeline or a local distribution company or LDC served by an interstate natural gas pipeline. Under Section 311, rates charged for intrastate transportation must be fair and equitable, and amounts collected in excess of fair and equitable rates are subject to refund with interest. The rates under Section 311 approved by FERC are maximum rates and we may negotiate at or below such rates depending on the market. Currently, FERC reviews our rates every five years and such rates may increase or decrease as a result of such reviews. The next rate review occurs in 2017. The terms and conditions of service set forth in the intrastate pipeline's statement of operating conditions are also subject to FERC's review and approval. In the future, should FERC determine not to authorize rates which fully recover our costs of service, our business may be adversely affected. Failure to observe the service limitations applicable to transportation and storage services under Section 311, failure to comply with the rates approved by FERC for Section 311 service, and/or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of service established in the pipeline's FERC-approved statement of operating conditions could result in alteration of jurisdictional status, and/or the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies or sanctions.
Hinshaw Pipelines
Similar to intrastate pipelines, Hinshaw pipelines, by definition, also operate within a single state. We have a Mississippi pipeline segment that is categorized as a Hinshaw pipeline. Also, similar to pipelines operating under Section 311 of the NGPA, Hinshaw pipelines can receive gas from outside their state without becoming subject to the jurisdiction of FERC under the Natural Gas Act ("NGA"). Specifically, Section 1(c) of the NGA exempts from FERC's NGA jurisdiction those pipelines that transport gas in interstate commerce if (1) they receive natural gas at or within the boundary of a state, (2) all the gas is 
15

consumed within that state and (3) the pipeline is regulated by a state commission. Following the enactment of the NGPA, FERC issued Order No. 63 authorizing Hinshaw pipelines to apply for authorization to transport natural gas in interstate commerce in the same manner as intrastate pipelines operating pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA. Hinshaw pipelines frequently operate pursuant to blanket certificates to provide transportation and sales service under FERC's regulations.
Gathering Pipeline Regulation
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of FERC. Although FERC has not made a formal determination with respect to all of our facilities we believe to be gathering facilities, we believe that our natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is, therefore, not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. In recent years, FERC has taken a more light-handed approach to regulation of the gathering activities of interstate pipeline transmission companies, which has resulted in a number of such companies transferring gathering facilities to unregulated affiliates. As a result of these activities, natural gas gathering may begin to receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels. Our natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject to more stringent application of state or federal regulation of rates and services. Our natural gas gathering operations also may be or become subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.
Our natural gas gathering operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in most of the states in which we operate. These statutes generally require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. The regulations under these statutes can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas. The states in which we operate have adopted a complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. To date, there have been no adverse effects to our systems due to these regulations.
Market Behavior Rules; Reporting Requirements
Interstate natural gas pipelines regulated by FERC are required to comply with numerous regulations related to standards of conduct, market transparency, and market manipulation. FERC’s standards of conduct regulate the manner in which interstate natural gas pipelines may interact with their marketing affiliates. FERC’s market oversight and transparency regulations require regulated entities to submit reports of, among other things, threshold purchases or sales of natural gas and publicly post certain information on scheduled volumes. FERC’s market manipulation regulations, promulgated pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct 2005”), make it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The EPAct 2005 also amends the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”) to give FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes up to $1.0 million per day per violation for violations occurring after August 8, 2005. The maximum penalty authority established by the statute has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.
State Utility Regulation
Some of our operations in Texas are specifically subject to the Texas Gas Utility Regulatory Act, as implemented by the Railroad Commission of Texas ("RRC"). Generally, the RRC has authority to ensure that rates charged for natural gas sales or transportation services are just and reasonable. Our gas utilities, Southcross CCNG Gathering Ltd., Southcross CCNG Transmission Ltd. and Southcross Gulf Coast Transmission Ltd., Southcross Nueces Pipelines LLC, FL Rich Gas Utility and TexStar Transmission, LP are required to file gas tariffs and Southcross NGL Pipeline Ltd. has filed NGL tariffs with the RRC.
16

In Mississippi, the Mississippi Public Service Commission considers Southcross Mississippi Industrial Gas Sales, L.P. a utility and it is necessary to get contract approval for negotiated contracts.
In Alabama, the Alabama Public Service Commission ("APSC") requires a gas utility to file "special negotiated contracts" with the APSC for approval, which includes our Southcross Alabama Pipeline LLC.
Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.
Sales of Natural Gas and NGLs
The transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated by FERC under the NGA, the NGPA and regulations issued under those statutes and the transportation of NGLs in interstate commerce has been regulated by FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act. Historically the price, terms and conditions of the sale of natural gas at wholesale in interstate commerce was regulated by FERC, but the sale of NGLs was not regulated. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the NGPA and culminated in adoption of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act which removed all price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993.
The price at which we sell natural gas is currently not subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. However, with regard to our physical sales of these energy commodities, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC. Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
Sales of NGLs are currently not regulated and are made at negotiated prices. While sales by producers of natural gas and sales of NGLs can currently be made at market prices, Congress could enact price controls in the future.
As discussed above, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting interstate natural gas pipelines and those initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas both directly and indirectly.
Anti-terrorism Measures
The Department of Homeland Security Appropriation Act of 2007 requires the Department of Homeland Security (the "DHS") to issue regulations establishing risk-based performance standards for the security of chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities that are deemed to present "high levels of security risk." The DHS issued an interim final rule in April 2007 regarding risk-based performance standards to be attained pursuant to this act and, on November 20, 2007, further issued an Appendix A to the interim rules that establishes chemicals of interest and their respective threshold quantities that will trigger compliance with these interim rules. In addition, in August 2014, DHS issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking designed to identify ways to make the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program more effective. Covered facilities that are determined by DHS to pose a high level of security risk are required to prepare and submit Security Vulnerability Assessments and Site Security Plans as well as comply with other regulatory requirements, including those regarding inspections, audits, record-keeping and protection of chemical-terrorism vulnerability information. Three of our facilities (the Gregory, Conroe and Woodsboro plants) have more than the threshold quantity of listed chemicals; therefore, a "Top Screen" evaluation was submitted to the DHS. The DHS reviewed this information and determined that none of the facilities are considered high-risk chemical facilities.
Cyber Security Measures
While we are currently not subject to governmental standards for the protection of computer-based systems and technology from cyber threats and attacks, proposals to establish such standards are being considered in the U.S. Congress and by U.S. Executive Branch departments and agencies, including the DHS, and we may become subject to such standards in the future. Currently, we are implementing our own cyber security programs and protocols; however, we cannot guarantee their effectiveness. A significant cyber-attack could have a material effect on our operations and those of our customers.
Environmental Matters
General
Our operation of pipelines, plants and other facilities for natural gas gathering, processing, treating, compression and transportation, and for NGL fractionation and transportation services is subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. As an owner or operator of these facilities, we must comply 
17

with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:

• | requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment or otherwise restricting the way we operate or imposing additional costs on our operations;


• | managing or otherwise regulating the way we handle and secure toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive materials to prevent or minimize the release of such materials;


• | limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species;


• | delaying system modification or upgrades during permit reviews;


• | requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former or third-party operations; and


• | enjoining the operations of facilities deemed to be in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to or permit requirements imposed by such environmental laws and regulations.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other materials into the environment.
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and, thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. We also actively participate in industry groups that help formulate recommendations for addressing existing or future regulations.
We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we believe that the various environmental activities in which we are presently engaged are not expected to materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability to gather, process, treat, compress and transport natural gas and fractionate and transport NGLs. We cannot provide assurance, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws, regulations, or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs. Below is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid and hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, release and disposal of hazardous substances and solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where these materials may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA" or the "Superfund Law"), and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to cleanup sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.

We also generate industrial wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the "RCRA"), and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. We generate little hazardous waste; however, it is possible that certain non-hazardous waste, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, will in the future be designated as "hazardous wastes" and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly management and disposal requirements. Moreover, from time to time, the EPA and state regulatory agencies have considered the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes, including natural gas wastes. Any such changes 
18

in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses or otherwise impose limits or restrictions on our operations or those of our customers.
We currently own or lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although previous operators have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently aware of any facts, events or conditions relating to such requirements that could materially impact our operations or financial condition.
Oil Pollution Act
In 1991, the EPA adopted regulations under the Oil Pollution Act (the "OPA"). These oil pollution prevention regulations, as amended several times since their original adoption, require the preparation of a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan ("SPCC") for facilities engaged in drilling, producing, gathering, storing, processing, refining, transferring, distributing, using, or consuming oil and oil products, and which due to their location, could reasonably be expected to discharge oil in harmful quantities into or upon the navigable waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of an SPCC-regulated facility is required to prepare a written, site-specific spill prevention plan, which details how a facility's operations comply with the requirements. To be in compliance, the facility's SPCC plan must satisfy all of the applicable requirements for drainage, bulk storage tanks, tank car and truck loading and unloading, transfer operations (intrafacility piping), inspections and records, security, and training. Most importantly, the facility must fully implement the SPCC plan and train personnel in its execution. We believe that none of our facilities is materially adversely affected by such requirements.
Air Emissions
Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act (the "CAA"), and comparable state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including our compressor stations and processing plants, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that we obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. We and our customers may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions. We believe, however, that our operations will not be materially adversely affected by such requirements.
On January 30, 2013, the EPA finalized amendments to new regulations under the CAA to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants from stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines and stationary internal combustion engines. The scope of applicability for most of our engines is the requirement to follow a prescribed maintenance plan or comply with already existing New Source Performance Standard. Although this rule has been the subject of litigation and may be revised, we do not anticipate that the revisions will have a material adverse effect on our operations. The few engines we do have that are subject to the control and compliance provisions of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants Standard are new engines which meet the emissions limitations therein. 
On April 17, 2012, the EPA approved final rules that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. This rule addresses emissions of various pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. For new or reworked hydraulically-fractured gas wells, the final rule requires controlling emissions through flaring until 2015, when the rule requires the use of reduced emission, or "green", completions. The rule also established specific new requirements for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, gas processing plants and certain other equipment. On August 5, 2013, the EPA finalized updates to the 2012 performance standards for emissions of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) from storage tanks used in oil and natural gas production and transmission, which, among other things, adjusted reporting requirements and phased in the date by which storage tanks must install VOC controls. On June 3, 2016, the EPA issued additional regulations to control emissions of methane and VOCs from various oil and natural gas operations. Compliance with these rules could result in additional costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, for us and our customers which may adversely impact our business.
19

Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the "Clean Water Act"), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters as well as waters of the U.S. and impose requirements affecting our ability to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. In May 2015, the EPA issued a final rule that attempts to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the U.S., but this rule has been stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. On January 13, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the Sixth Circuit’s finding that it has jurisdiction to hear challenges to the rule. To the extent the rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. Certain state regulations and the general permits issued under the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program prohibit the discharge of pollutants and chemicals. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. These permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. In May 2015, the EPA issued a final rule that, if upheld in the federal court system, may expand the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States and may result in increased costs and delays in obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities. We believe that compliance with existing permits and compliance with foreseeable new permit requirements under the Clean Water Act and state counterparts will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
Endangered Species
The Endangered Species Act (the "ESA") restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. The current listing of species as threatened or endangered has not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans or limit future development activity in the affected areas.
Climate Change
The EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that require certain large stationary sources to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("PSD") pre-construction permits and Title V operating permits for greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions which does not currently apply to our facilities. In addition, in September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from certain large GHG emissions sources. Our Gregory, Woodsboro, Bonnie View, Conroe, Lone Star and El Dorado facilities are or will be required to report under this rule. This reporting rule was expanded in November 2010 to include petroleum and natural gas facilities, including certain natural gas transmission compression facilities, and again in October 2015 to include onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting activities and natural gas transmission pipelines. We have submitted the reports required under the reporting rule on a timely basis and have adopted procedures for future required reporting. In addition, on June 3, 2016, the EPA issued regulations to control emissions of methane, a GHG, and VOCs from various oil and natural gas operations. Compliance with these rules could result in additional costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, for us and our customers which may adversely impact our business.
While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, the prospect for adoption of significant legislation at the federal level to reduce GHG emissions is perceived to be low at this time. Several states have also implemented programs to reduce and/or monitor GHG emissions. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that limit emissions of GHGs could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that exploration and production operators produce, including our current or future customers, which could thereby reduce demand for our midstream services.
In addition, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce GHG emissions. We continue to monitor the international efforts to address climate change. To the extent the United States and other countries implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and gas industry, it could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business.
Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. To the extent that our products are competing 
20

with higher GHG emitting energy sources, our products would become more desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. To the extent that our products are competing with lower GHG emitting energy sources such as solar and wind, our products would become less desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations.
Finally, increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. Due to their location, our operations along the Gulf Coast are vulnerable to operational and structural damages resulting from hurricanes and other severe weather systems and our insurance may not cover all associated losses. We are taking steps to mitigate physical risks from storms, but no assurance can be given that future storms will not have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Employees
Currently, we do not have any employees. We rely solely on officers and employees of our General Partner to operate and manage our business. Our General Partner employed 268 full-time employees as of December 31, 2016. None of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and our General Partner considers its employee relations to be good.
