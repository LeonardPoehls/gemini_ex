We empower traders to reduce the end-to-end cost of implementing investments via technology-enabled liquidity, execution, analytics and workflow solutions. The firm is headquartered in New York with offices in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region.
 ITG’s business is organized into four reportable operating segments: U.S. Operations, Canadian Operations, European Operations and Asia Pacific Operations (see Note 22, Segment Reporting, to the consolidated financial statements). These four operating segments provide the following categories of products and services:
    
· | Execution Services — includes (a) self-directed trading using algorithms, smart routing and matching through POSIT in cash equities (including single stocks and portfolio lists), futures and options trading and (b) portfolio trading and high-touch trading desks providing execution expertise
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Workflow Technology — includes trade order and execution management software applications in addition to network connectivity
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Analytics — includes (a) tools enabling portfolio managers and traders to improve pre-trade, real-time and post-trade execution performance, (b) portfolio construction and optimization decisions and (c) securities valuation
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Regional segment results exclude the impact of corporate activity, which is presented separately and includes investment income and other gains as well as costs not associated with operating the businesses within the Company’s regional segments. These costs include, among others, (a) the costs of being a public company, such as certain staff costs, a portion of external audit fees, and reporting, filing and listing costs, (b) intangible asset amortization, (c) interest expense, (d) professional fees associated with our global transfer pricing structure, (e) foreign exchange gains or losses and (f) certain non‑operating revenues and expenses.
 Execution Services
 ITG execution services includes self‑directed trading by clients using algorithms and smart routing for cash equities, futures and options as well as matching in cash equities through POSIT, our Alternative Trading System (“ATS”). ITG execution services also provides execution expertise through portfolio trading and single stock trading desks. ITG’s Algorithms and Smart Order Router
 ITG’s algorithms and Smart Order Router offer portfolio managers and traders a way to trade orders quickly, comprehensively and cost‑efficiently from our Execution Management Systems (“EMS”) or our Order Management System (“OMS”) and most third‑party trading platforms. The algorithms execute orders anonymously and discreetly, thereby potentially lowering market impact costs and improving overall performance. ITG’s algorithms help users pursue best execution through two suites: ITG Single‑Stock Algorithms and ITG List‑Based Algorithms.

 Smart Order Router offers a solution for routing trades that can help capture liquidity with a combination of speed and confidentiality. These routers continuously scan markets for liquidity with an emphasis on trading without displaying the order. Smart Order Router uses proprietary techniques to quickly execute at the best available prices.
 POSIT
 POSIT was launched in 1987 as a point‑in‑time electronic crossing network. Today, POSIT provides anonymous continuous and scheduled crossing of non‑displayed (or dark) equity orders and price improvement opportunities within the National Best Bid and Offer (“NBBO”). ITG has also developed versions of POSIT for trading U.S. corporate bonds (POSIT FI) and foreign exchange (POSIT FX).
 POSIT Alert is a block crossing mechanism within POSIT. POSIT Alert scans uncommitted shares from participating clients. When a crossing opportunity is detected, POSIT Alert notifies the relevant buy‑side users that a matching opportunity exists.
 POSIT Marketplace provides access to POSIT liquidity, the dark pools of other ATSs, and certain exchange dark order types. POSIT Marketplace is a dark pool aggregator that provides clients with access to a large range of non‑displayed liquidity destinations. POSIT Marketplace uses advanced quantitative techniques in an effort to interact with quality liquidity while protecting clients from gaming.
 ITG Derivatives
 ITG Derivatives provides electronic listed futures and options trading, including algorithmic trading and direct market access. ITG Derivatives offers advanced options features for traders employing volatility‑neutral or delta‑neutral strategies and also provides low‑latency application programming interfaces.
 High‑Touch Trading
 ITG provides single-stock and option sales trading as well as portfolio trading for institutional clients. ITG’s trading desks are staffed with experienced trading professionals who provide ITG clients with execution through advanced electronic tools.
 Commission Management Services
 ITG offers administration and consolidation of client commission arrangements across a wide range of our clients’ preferred brokerage and research providers through Commission Manager, a robust, multi‑asset, web‑based commission management portal. Workflow Technology
 Execution Management and Order Management
 Our EMSs are designed to meet the needs of a broad range of trading styles. Triton is ITG’s award‑winning, multi‑asset and broker‑neutral EMS, which brings a complete set of integrated execution and analytical tools to the user’s desktop for global list‑based and single‑stock trading, as well as futures and options capabilities and a fully integrated and supported financial services communications network (ITG Net). Triton Derivatives is a broker‑neutral, direct‑access EMS that provides traders with access to scalable, low‑latency, multi‑asset trading opportunities.
 Our OMS combines portfolio management, compliance functionality (ITG’s Compliance Monitoring System), and a fully integrated and supported financial services communications network (ITG Net) with a consolidated, outsourced service for global trade matching and settlement (Trade Ops) that provides connectivity to the industry’s post‑trade utilities, as well as support for multiple, flexible settlement communication methods and a real‑time process monitor.
 ITG Net
 ITG Net is a global financial communications network that provides secure, reliable and fully supported

connectivity between buy‑side and sell‑side firms for multi‑asset order routing and indication‑of‑interest messages with ITG and third‑party trading platforms. ITG Net supports approximately 9,000 billable connections to more than 580 unique brokerage firms worldwide. ITG Net also integrates the trading products of third‑party brokers and ATSs into our OMS and EMS platforms.
 RFQ‑hub
 In July 2014, ITG acquired ID’S, a Paris‑based company that operated RFQ‑hub, a multi‑asset platform for global‑listed and over‑the‑counter (“OTC”) financial instruments. RFQ‑hub connects buy‑side trading desks and portfolio managers with a large network of sell‑side market makers in Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific region, allowing these trading desks to place requests‑for‑quotes (“RFQ”) in negotiated equities, futures, options, swaps, convertible bonds, structured products and commodities. RFQ‑hub is available as a stand‑alone platform and is also integrated with Triton.
 Single Ticket Clearing
 ITG’s commitment to best execution platforms also extends to broker‑neutral operational services to help ensure that trades clear and settle efficiently, and to significantly lower the transaction costs associated with trade tickets. Single Ticket Clearing is a broker‑neutral service that aggregates executions across multiple destinations for settlement purposes. Single Ticket Clearing helps reduce the number of trade tickets and resulting charges imposed by custodians, reducing the costs of trade processing due to market fragmentation. Analytics
 Trading Analytics
 The ITG Smart Trading Analytics suite enables portfolio managers and traders to improve execution performance before the trade happens (pre‑trade) and during trading (real‑time) by providing reliable trading analytics and risk models that help them perform predictive analyses, manage risk, change strategy and reduce trading costs. Trading costs are affected by multiple factors, such as execution strategies, time horizon, volatility, spread, volume and order size. ITG Smart Trading Analytics gauges the effects of these factors and aids in the understanding of the trade‑off between market impact and opportunity cost.
 ITG’s Transaction Cost Analysis (“TCA”) offers unique measurement and reporting capabilities to analyze costs and performance across the trading continuum. TCA assesses trading performance and implicit costs under various market conditions so users can adjust strategies and potentially reduce costs and boost investment performance. TCA is also available for foreign exchange transactions (TCA for FX).
 Alpha Capture Reporting measures cost at every point of the investment process and provides portfolio managers with quarterly analytical reviews, written interpretations and on‑site consultative recommendations to enhance performance.
 Portfolio Analytics
 ITG provides market‑leading tools to assist asset managers with portfolio decision‑making tasks from portfolio construction and optimization to the enterprise challenge of global, real‑time portfolio performance monitoring.
 Fair Value helps mutual fund managers meet their obligations to investors and regulators to fairly price the securities within their funds, and helps minimize the impact of market timing.
 ITG Opt allows portfolio managers to develop new portfolio construction strategies and solve complex optimization problems. ITG Opt allows users to accurately model tax liability, transaction costs and long/short objectives, while adhering to diverse portfolio‑specific constraints.

 Competition
 The financial services industry generally, and the institutional securities brokerage business in which we operate, are extremely competitive, and we expect them to remain so for the foreseeable future. Our full suite of products does not directly compete with a particular firm; however, individual products compete with various firms and consortia:
· | Our trading and portfolio analytics compete with offerings from several sell‑side‑affiliated and independent companies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | POSIT and MATCHNow compete with various national and regional securities exchanges, ATSs, Electronic Communication Networks, Multilateral Trading Facilities (“MTFs”), and systematic internalizers for trade execution services. These venues have proliferated in recent years.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our EMSs, OMS, connectivity and RFQ services compete with offerings from independent vendors, agency‑only firms and other sell‑side firms.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our algorithmic and smart routing products, as well as our high‑touch agency execution and portfolio trading services, compete with agency‑only and other sell‑side firms.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In many cases we face competitors that are larger than we are and have greater financial resources than we have and may have more flexibility to offer a broader set of products and services than we can. Competition is also intense for the recruitment and retention of qualified professionals. The performance of our business is in large part dependent on the skills, expertise and performance of our employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our continued ability to attract new professionals and retain and motivate our existing professionals.
 Regulation
 Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various securities regulations and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate.

In addition to federal and SRO oversight, securities firms are also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business. Furthermore, our non‑U.S. subsidiaries are subject to regulation by central banks and regulatory bodies in those jurisdictions where each subsidiary is authorized to do business, as further discussed below.

  Broker‑dealers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities trading business, including sales methods, trade practices, investment research distribution, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital structure, record keeping and conduct of directors, officers and employees. Additional legislation or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may directly affect the mode of operation and profitability of broker‑dealers. The SEC, SROs, state securities commissions and foreign regulatory authorities may conduct administrative proceedings or commence judicial actions, which can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease‑and‑desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker‑dealer, its directors, officers or employees.
 ITG Inc., AlterNet, and ITG Derivatives are required by law to belong to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”).

 Net Capital Requirement
 ITG Inc., AlterNet and ITG Derivatives are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3‑1) under the Exchange Act, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital.
 ITG Inc. has elected to use the alternative method permitted by Rule 15c3‑1, which requires that ITG Inc. maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of $1.0 million or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions, as defined. AlterNet and ITG Derivatives have elected to use the basic method permitted by Rule 15c3‑1, which requires that they maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of 62/3% of aggregate indebtedness or $100,000. On August 2, 2016, ITG Derivatives was approved as an introducing broker, resulting in a reduction of its minimum net capital requirement from $1.0 million to $100,000. Dividends or withdrawals of capital cannot be made if capital is needed to comply with regulatory requirements.  In addition, our Canadian, European and Asia Pacific Operations have subsidiaries with regulatory capital requirements.
 For further information on our net capital position, see Note 16, Net Capital Requirement, to the consolidated financial statements.
 Research and Product Development
 We devote a significant portion of our resources to the development and improvement of technology‑based services. Important aspects of our research and development efforts include enhancements of existing software, the ongoing development of new software and services and investment in technology to enhance our efficiency.
 The amounts expensed for research and development costs, excluding routine maintenance, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are estimated at $31.8 million, $29.2 million and $35.8 million, respectively.
 Intellectual Property
 Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, know‑how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position.
 We own a portfolio of patents and patent applications, in the U.S. and abroad, that principally relate to financial services, information technology and software. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. We also own and maintain a portfolio of trademarks. The extent and duration of trademark rights are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.
 While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position is heavily dependent on patent or trademark protection or that our operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.
 It is our practice to enter into confidentiality and intellectual property ownership agreements with our clients, employees, independent contractors and business partners, and to control access to, and distribution of, our intellectual property.
 Clients
 For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no single client accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated revenue.
 Employees
 On December 31, 2016, the Company employed 956 staff globally, of whom 610, 91, 146, and 109 staff were employed by the U.S., Canadian, European and Asia Pacific Operations, respectively.
