ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Background of Company
KEMET Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” “KEMET” and the “Company”), is a global manufacturer of passive electronic components. We first began manufacturing tantalum capacitors in 1958 as a division of Union Carbide Corporation (“UCC”) and became a stand-alone legal entity in 1990 following a management buyout from UCC. In 1992, we publicly issued shares of our common stock. Since then, we have made the following acquisitions:

Business Segment | Fiscal Year | Business 
Solid Capacitors Segment (“Solid Capacitors”) | 2007 | Tantalum Business Unit of EPCOS AG 
Film and Electrolytic Segment (“Film and Electrolytic”) | 2008 | Evox Rifa Group Oyj 
Film and Electrolytic | 2008 | Arcotronics Italia S.p.A. 
Film and Electrolytic | 2012 | Cornell Dubilier Foil, LLC (renamed KEMET Foil Manufacturing, LLC (“KFM”))
Solid Capacitors | 2012 | Niotan Incorporated (renamed KEMET Blue Powder Corporation (“KBP”)) 
Corporate | 2013 | 34% economic interest in TOKIN Corporation (“TOKIN”) (1) 
Corporate | 2016 | IntelliData, Inc. (“IntelliData”) 
Solid Capacitors and Electro-Magnetic, Sensors, and Actuators Segment ("MSA") | 2018 | TOKIN (1) 


______________________________________________________________________________
(1) In fiscal year 2013, our subsidiary, KEMET Electronics Corporation (“KEC”) acquired a 34% economic interest in TOKIN as calculated based on the number of common shares held by KEC, directly and indirectly, in proportion to the aggregate number of common and preferred shares of TOKIN outstanding as of such date. The Company accounted for its investment in TOKIN using the equity method for a non-consolidated variable interest entity since KEC did not have the power to direct significant activities of TOKIN. KEMET entered into a Definitive NEC TOKIN Stock Purchase Agreement (the “TOKIN Purchase Agreement”) with NEC Corporation (“NEC”), to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock of TOKIN not already held by KEMET. The transaction closed on April 19, 2017 and on that date TOKIN became a 100% indirect owned subsidiary of KEMET. 
Through the above acquisitions and organic growth we have expanded our product base to include multilayer ceramic, solid and electrolytic aluminum and film capacitors, and electro-magnetic, sensors, and actuators.
General
We compete in the passive electronic component industry, specifically multilayer ceramic, tantalum, film and aluminum (solid and electrolytic) capacitors, and Electro-Magnetic Compatible ("EMC") devices, sensors, and actuators. Product offerings include surface mount, which are attached directly to the circuit board; leaded capacitors, which are attached to the circuit board using lead wires; and chassis-mount and other pin-through-hole board-mount capacitors, which utilize attachment methods such as screw terminal and snap-in. Capacitors are electronic components that store, filter, and regulate electrical energy and current flow. As an essential passive component used in nearly all circuit boards, capacitors are typically used for coupling, decoupling, filtering, oscillating and wave shaping and are used in communication systems, servers, personal computers, tablets, cellular phones, automotive electronic systems, defense and aerospace systems, consumer electronics, power management systems and many other electronic devices and systems (basically anything that plugs in or has a battery). 
Our product line consists of many distinct part configurations distinguished by various attributes, such as dielectric (or insulating) material, configuration, encapsulation, capacitance (at various tolerances), voltage, performance characteristics and packaging. Most of our customers have multiple capacitance requirements, often within each of their products. Our broad product offering allows us to meet the majority of those needs independent of application and end use.
We believe the long-term demand for the various types of capacitors we offer will grow on a regional and global basis due to a variety of factors, including increasing demand for and complexity of electronic products, growing demand for technology in emerging markets and the ongoing development of new solutions for energy generation and conservation. Our customer base includes most of the world’s major electronics original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), electronics manufacturing services providers (“EMSs”) and distributors listed below.

Major OEMs:

• | Bosch Group, Cisco Systems Inc., Continental AG, Delphi Technologies PLC, Tesla Inc. and Denso in the automotive segment.


• | Apple Inc., Western Digital Corporation, Dell Inc., Nintendo and Google LLC in the Computer and consumer segment.


• | ABB Group, Terumo Corporation, Horiba and Schlumberger in the industrial and alternative energy segment.

Major EMSs:

• | Flex Ltd, Jabil Circuit Inc., Celestica Inc and Sanmina-SCI Corporation

Major Distributors:

• | TTI, Inc., Arrow Electronics, Inc. and Avnet, Inc.

Solid Capacitors products are commonly used in conjunction with integrated circuits, and the same circuit may, and frequently does, contain both ceramic and tantalum capacitors. Tantalum capacitors are a popular choice because of their ability for high capacitance in a small volume package. While ceramic capacitors are more cost-effective at lower capacitance values, tantalum capacitors are more cost-effective at higher capacitance values while solid aluminum capacitors can be more effective in special applications. 
Film, paper and aluminum electrolytic capacitors can be used to support integrated circuits, but also are used in the field of power electronics to provide energy for applications such as motor starts, power conditioning, electromagnetic interference filtering safety and inverters. Capacitors account for the largest market within the passive component product grouping.
The acquisition of TOKIN (the "TOKIN Acquisition") allowed the Company entry into EMC devices and sensor and actuator markets. The EMC business offers a broad line of electrical noise management products. As circuits become more complex within a device, and the amount of information being communicated between devices increases at a dramatic rate, the quality of electronic signals becomes key to the integrity of the information being communicated. TOKIN EMC products play a key role in maintaining signal integrity across a number of end markets including telecommunications, mobile computing, automotive and general industries. The sensor and actuator business manufactures products that sense and respond to human activity, physical vibration, and electric current. These products are found in home appliances, consumer devices and industrial electrical equipment. 
Our Industry 
We compete with others that manufacture and distribute capacitors both domestically and globally and our success in the market is influenced by many factors, including price, availability, engineering specifications, quality and breadth of offering, performance characteristics, customer service and geographic location of our manufacturing sites. As in all manufacturing industries, there is ongoing pressure on average unit selling prices for capacitors. To help mitigate this effect, KEMET, as well as many of our larger competitors, have relocated their manufacturing operations to low cost regions and locations in closer proximity to our respective customers. 
Because capacitors are a fundamental component of electronic circuits, demand for capacitors tends to reflect the general demand for electronic products, as well as integrated circuits, which, though cyclical, continues to grow. We believe growth in the electronics market and the resulting growth in demand for capacitors will be driven primarily by a number of recent trends which include:

• | the development of new products and applications, such as alternative and renewable energy systems, hybrid transportation systems, electronic controls for engines and industrial machinery, smart phones and mobile personal computing devices;


• | the “internet-of-things” products;


• | the next generation of automotive electronics to support advance driver assistance systems, as well as the connected car;


• | the increase in the electronic content of existing products, such as home appliances and medical equipment;


• | consumer desire for mobility and connectivity; and


• | the enhanced functionality, complexity and convergence of electronic devices that use state-of-the-art microprocessors.

The acquisition of TOKIN increases our market opportunity through the EMC devices and sensor and actuator markets.
Markets and Customers
Our products are sold to a variety of OEMs in a broad range of industries including the computer, communications, automotive, military, consumer, industrial and aerospace industries. We also sell products to EMS providers, which serve OEMs in these industries. Electronics distributors are an important channel of distribution in the electronics industry and represent the largest channel through which we sell our capacitors. One electronics distributor, TTI, Inc., accounted for over 10% of our net sales in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. If our relationship with this customer were to terminate, we would need to determine alternative means of delivering our products to the end-customers served by them. In addition, an aggregate of over 10% of our net sales in fiscal year 2018 were driven by sales to EMS providers for incorporation into Apple Inc. products. 
While we are seeing a merging of major segments as connectivity and “internet-of-things” grow, the following table presents an overview of the diverse industries that incorporate our capacitors into their products and the general nature of those products.

Industry | Products 
Automotive | Adaptive cruise control, High intensity discharge headlamps, Light emitting diode electronic modules, Lane departure warning, Camera systems, Audio systems, Tire pressure monitoring, Power train electronics, Instrumentation, Airbag systems, Anti-lock braking and stabilization systems, Hybrid and electric drive vehicles, Electronic engine control modules, Driver comfort controls, Security systems, Radar, Connectivity systems and Advance driver assistance gear
Communications | Smart phones, Telephones, Switching equipment, Relays, Base stations, and Wireless infrastructure 
Computer-related | Personal computers (laptops, tablets, notebooks), Workstations, Servers, Mainframes, Computer peripheral equipment, Power supplies, Solid state drives, and Local area networks 
Industrial | Electronic controls, Measurement equipment, Instrumentation, Solar and wind energy generation, Down-hole drilling and Medical electronics

Military/Aerospace | Avionics, Radar, Guidance systems, and Satellite communications 
Alternative Energy | Wind generation systems, Solar generation systems, Geothermal generation systems, Tidal generation systems and Electric drive vehicles 

We produce a small percentage of capacitors under military specification standards sold for both military and commercial uses. We do not sell any capacitors directly to the United States government. Certain of our customers purchase capacitors for products in the military and aerospace industries.
It is impracticable to report revenues from external customers for each of the above noted products primarily because approximately 39.2% of our external sales were to electronics distributors for fiscal year 2018.
TOKIN increases our position in the following industries that incorporate EMC devices, sensors, and actuators into their products:

Industry | Products 
Telecom Infrastructure | Switching equipment, Base stations, and Wireless infrastructure 
Gaming | Consoles, Displays, Power management 
Consumer | Battery chargers/AC adapters, Power supply, Refrigerators, Inductive cooking and Air conditioning
Automotive | Infotainment and Power supply

KEMET in the United States
Our corporate headquarters is located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 
Commodity manufacturing previously located in the United States has been substantially relocated to our lower-cost manufacturing facilities in Mexico, China and Europe. Production remaining in the United States focuses primarily on early-stage manufacturing of new products and other specialty products for which customers are predominantly located in North America. 
On February 21, 2012, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Blue Powder, a leading manufacturer of tantalum powders. Blue Powder had been a significant supplier of tantalum powder to KEMET for several years. KBP's principal operating location is in Carson City, Nevada. Over the next several quarters, the Company will modify its vertical integration strategy by relocating its tantalum powder facility equipment from Carson City, Nevada to its existing Matamoros, Mexico plant.
To accelerate the pace of innovations, KEMET maintains an Innovation Center for Solid Capacitors near Greenville, South Carolina. The primary objectives of the KEMET Innovation Center are to ensure the flow of new product platforms, material sets, and processes that are expected to keep us at the forefront of our customers’ product designs, while enabling these products to be transferred rapidly to the most appropriate KEMET manufacturing location in the world for low-cost, high-volume production. 
KEMET in Mexico
We believe our operations in Mexico are among the most cost efficient in the world, and we expect they will continue to be our primary production facilities supporting North American and European customers for Solid Capacitors. One of the strengths of KEMET Mexico is that it is a local operation, including local management and workers. These facilities are responsible for maintaining KEMET’s tradition of excellence in quality, service, and delivery, while driving costs down. The facilities in Victoria and Matamoros are focused primarily on tantalum capacitors, while the facilities in Monterrey are focused on ceramic capacitors.
KEMET in Asia Pacific
We have a well-established manufacturing, sales and logistics network in Asia to support our customers’ Asian operations. We currently manufacture tantalum and aluminum polymer and electrolytic products in China. In addition, as a result of the acquisition of TOKIN on April 19, 2017, we manufacture electromagnetic compatibility and sensor and actuator products in China, Japan and Vietnam and tantalum capacitors in Thailand and Japan. The vision for KEMET's foreign subsidiaries is for them to be primarily local operations, with local management and workers, to help achieve our objective of being a global company. These facilities are responsible for maintaining our tradition of excellence in quality, service, and delivery, while accelerating cost-reduction efforts and supporting efforts to grow our customer base in Asia. In addition, we operate one innovation center for Solid Capacitors and two innovation centers for MSA in Japan.
KEMET in Europe
We currently have one or more manufacturing locations in each of the following countries: Bulgaria, Finland, Italy, Macedonia, Portugal, and Sweden. In addition, we operate product innovation centers in Italy, Portugal and Sweden. We continue to maintain and enhance our strong European sales and customer service infrastructure, allowing us to continue to meet the local preferences of European customers who remain an important focus for KEMET.
Global Sales and Logistics
KEMET serves the needs of our global customer base through four geographic regions: North America and South America (“Americas”), Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), Asia and the Pacific Rim (“APAC”) and Japan and Korea ("JPKO"). We also have independent sales representatives located in several countries worldwide including: Brazil, Israel, Canada, and the United States. 
In our major markets, we market and sell our products primarily through a direct sales force. With a global sales organization that is customer-focused, our direct sales personnel from around the world serve on KEMET Global Account Teams committed to serving any customer location in the world with a dedicated KEMET representative. The traditional sales team is supported by regional Field Application Engineers who are experts in electronic engineering and market all of KEMET’s products by assisting customers with the resolution of capacitor application issues. We believe our direct sales force creates a distinct advantage in the marketplace by enabling us to establish and maintain strong relationships with our customers to efficiently process simple repeat business as well as to consult with customers on new and technically complex custom applications. In addition, where appropriate, we use independent commissioned representatives. This approach requires a blend 
7

of accountability and responsibility for specific customer locations, guided by an overall account strategy for each customer. Our sales team works with the customers throughout the entire purchasing process, following opportunities as they progress through concept, design, validation and, finally, mass production. In Japan, we market and sell directly and through manufacturers agents, who sell exclusively for KEMET or TOKIN, and do not carry competitor products. These manufacturers agents create unique custom solutions integrating our products which help pull our products though the channel.
Electronics distributors are an important distribution channel in the electronics industry and accounted for 39.2%, 46.8%, and 41.9% of our net sales in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A portion of our net sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by distributors. In addition, our distributor policy includes inventory price protection and “ship-from-stock and debit” (“SFSD”) programs common in the industry.
Sales by Geography
In fiscal years 2018 and 2017, net sales by region were as follows (dollars in thousands): 

 | Fiscal Year 2018 | | | | Fiscal Year 2017
 | Net Sales | | % ofTotal | | | | Net Sales | | % ofTotal
APAC | $ | 479,987 | | | 40.0 | % | | APAC | | $ | 288,764 | | | 38.1 | %
EMEA | 277,643 | | | 23.1 | % | | EMEA | | 237,890 | | | 31.4 | %
Americas | 259,105 | | | 21.6 | % | | Americas | | 224,056 | | | 29.6 | %
JPKO | 183,191 | | | 15.3 | % | | JPKO | | 7,081 | | | 0.9 | %
Total | $ | 1,199,926 | | | | | Total | | $ | 757,791 | | | 

We believe our regional balance of revenues is a benefit to our business. The geographic diversity of our net sales diminishes the impact of regional sales decreases caused by various holiday seasons. The Americas remains the leading region in the world for product design in activity where engagement with OEM design engineers determines product placement independent of the region of the world where the final product is manufactured. Please see Note 7, “Segment and Geographic Information” to our consolidated financial statements.
Inventory and Backlog
Our customers often encounter uncertain or changing demand for their products. They historically order products from us based on their forecast and if demand does not meet their forecasts, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments included in our backlog, in many instances without penalty. Additionally, many of our customers have started to require shorter lead times and “just in time” delivery. Consequently, the twelve month order backlog is not a meaningful trend indicator for us.
The Company is currently at or near sales capacity for many products. Although we manufacture and inventory standardized products, a portion of our products are produced to meet specific customer requirements. Cancellations by customers of orders already in production could have an impact on inventories. Historically, however, cancellations have not been significant.
Competition
The capacitor industry is characterized by, among other factors, a long-term trend toward lower prices, low transportation costs, and few import barriers. Competitive factors influencing the market for our products include: product quality, customer service, technical innovation, pricing, and timely delivery. We believe we compete favorably on the basis of each of these factors.
Our major global competitors in the passive electronic component industry include AVX Corporation, Coilcraft Inc., Elna Co., Ltd., Panasonic Corporation, Littelfuse, Inc., Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Samsung, Taiyo Yuden Co., Ltd., Schaffner Group, TDK-EPC Corporation, WIMA GmbH and Co., KG, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (“Vishay”) and 3M Company. 
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are tantalum powder, tantalum ore, palladium, aluminum, silver, copper, nickel and tin. These materials are considered commodities and are subject to price volatility. Additionally, any delays in obtaining raw materials for our products could hinder our ability to manufacture our products, negatively impacting our competitive position and our relationships with our customers.
8

Tantalum is mined principally in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mozambique and Rwanda. As a result of our tantalum vertical integration program which began in fiscal year 2012, we have reduced our exposure to price volatility and supply uncertainty in the tantalum supply chain. A majority of our tantalum needs are now met through our direct sourcing partners of conflict free tantalum ore or tantalum scrap reclaim, which is then processed into the intermediate product potassium heptafluorotantalate (commonly known as K-salt) at our own facility in Mexico or at third party locations, before final processing into tantalum powder at KBP. Price increases for tantalum ore, or for the remaining tantalum powder that we source from third parties, could impact our financial performance as we may not be able to pass all such price increases on to our customers.
Silver and aluminum have generally been available in sufficient quantities, and we believe there are a sufficient number of suppliers from which we can purchase our requirements. An increase in the price of silver and aluminum that we are unable to pass on to our customers, could, however, have an adverse effect on our profitability.
Patents and Trademarks
As of March 31, 2018, we held the following number of patents and trademarks:

 | Patents | Trademarks
United States | 313 | | 18 
Foreign | 1,006 | | 259

Many of our patents and trademarks were obtained as part of the TOKIN acquisition. We believe the success of our business is not materially dependent on the existence or duration of any individual patent, license, or trademark other than the trademarks “KEMET,” “KEMET Charged,” and "TOKIN". Our engineering and research and development staffs have developed and continue to develop proprietary manufacturing processes and equipment designed to enhance our manufacturing facilities and reduce costs.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses were $39.6 million, $27.4 million and $24.6 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts include expenditures for product development and the design and development of machinery and equipment for new processes and cost reduction efforts. We continue to invest in new technology to improve product performance and production efficiencies.
Segment Reporting
We are organized into three segments: Solid Capacitors, Film and Electrolytic and Electro-Magnetic, Sensors, and Actuators. Each segment is responsible for the operations of certain manufacturing sites as well as all related research and development efforts. The sales, marketing and corporate functions are shared by each of the segments. See Note 7, “Segment and Geographic Information” to our consolidated financial statements for other information regarding the Company, including net sales, operating income (loss), total assets, and financial information about geographic areas.
Solid Capacitors Segment
Solid Capacitors operates in ten manufacturing sites in the United States, Mexico and Asia and operates innovation centers in the United States and Japan. Solid Capacitors primarily produces tantalum, aluminum, polymer and ceramic capacitors which are sold globally. Solid Capacitors also produces tantalum powder used in the production of tantalum capacitors. Solid Capacitors employs approximately 8,150 employees worldwide. For fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, Solid Capacitors had consolidated net sales of $771.2 million, $575.1 million and $556.3 million, respectively.
We continue to make significant investments in tantalum production within Solid Capacitors and, based on net sales, we believe we are the largest tantalum capacitor manufacturer in the world. We believe we have one of the broadest lines of tantalum product offerings and are one of the leaders in the growing market for high-frequency surface mount tantalum and aluminum polymer capacitors. On February 21, 2012, we acquired KBP which we believe is the largest production facility for tantalum powder in the western hemisphere. The Company continues to streamline its vertical integration strategy and may take actions to improve the cost structure if the anticipated results are advantageous. The Company is in the process of relocating its tantalum powder facility equipment from Carson City, Nevada to its existing Matamoros, Mexico plant. 
Our tantalum product line is broad product portfolio, industry leading process and materials technology, global manufacturing base and on-time delivery capabilities allow us to serve a wide range of customers in a diverse group of end markets, including computing, telecommunications, consumer, medical, military, automotive and general industries. 
9

Our ceramic product line offers an extensive line of multilayer ceramic capacitors in a variety of sizes and configurations. We are one of the two leading ceramic capacitor manufacturers headquartered in the United States and among the ten largest manufacturers worldwide. 
Our ceramics product line is high temperature and capacitance stable product lines provide us with what we believe to be a significant advantage over many of our competitors, especially in high reliability markets, such as medical, industrial, defense and aerospace. Our other significant end-markets include computing, telecommunications, automotive and general industries. 
Film and Electrolytic Segment
Our Film and Electrolytic Segment produces film, paper and wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors. In addition, the segment designs and produce electromagnetic interference filters ("EMI filters"). Film capacitors can be used for applications requiring high power and high voltages. Whereas aluminum electrolytic capacitors can be used for applications requiring high energy at a reasonable price. EMI filters consist of capacitive and inductive elements that reduce electromagnetic disturbance in the frequency range desired. We believe we are one of the world’s largest suppliers of film capacitors and one of the leaders in wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors. Both product families serve industrial and automotive customers, and in particular, the emerging market for alternative energy and electrical vehicles. For fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, our Film and Electrolytic segment had consolidated net sales of $201.7 million, $182.7 million, and $178.5 million, respectively. Our Film and Electrolytic business is concentrated in Europe, and as such, is impacted by the change in the exchange rate for the Euro to the U.S. dollar. 
Our Film and Electrolytic Segment primarily serves the industrial and automotive markets. We believe our Film and Electrolytic Segment’s product portfolio, technology and experience allow us to significantly benefit from the continued growth in alternative energy solutions and energy efficiency solutions within both the automotive and industrial markets especially for demanding applications such as humidity, temperature, voltage, etc. We operate ten manufacturing sites throughout Europe and Asia and maintain product innovation centers in Italy, Portugal and Sweden. Our Film and Electrolytic Segment employs approximately 1,750 employees worldwide.
Electro-Magnetic, Sensors, and Actuators Segment
MSA operates in four manufacturing sites throughout Asia and operates a product innovation center in Japan. MSA is a new segment for KEMET in fiscal year 2018 resulting from the acquisition of TOKIN in April 2017. MSA primarily produces EMC materials and devices, piezo materials and actuators and various types of sensors which are sold globally. For the fiscal year 2018, our Electro-Magnetic, Sensors, and Actuators Segment had consolidated net sales of $227.0 million. Our MSA business is concentrated in Japan and Korea. Our MSA segment employs approximately 3,450 employees worldwide. 
The EMC device product line offers a broad line of electrical noise management products. As circuits become more complex within a device, and the amount of information being communicated between devices increases at a dramatic rate, the quality of electronic signals becomes key to the integrity of the information being communicated. EMC products play a key role in maintaining signal integrity across a number of end-markets including telecommunications, mobile computing, automotive and general industries.
The sensor and actuator product line manufactures products that sense and respond to human activity, physical vibration, and electric current. These products are found in home appliances, consumer devices industrial electrical equipment. In addition, we manufacture electromechanical actuation devices that are critical to the manufacture of semiconductor devices and the management of industrial and chemical gas flow. Sensors are an important family of devices as the “internet-of-things” continues to permeate everyday life.
Environmental and Regulatory Compliance
We are subject to various North American, European, and Asian national, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the handling and management of certain chemicals and materials used and generated in manufacturing electronic components. Based on the annual costs incurred over the past several years, we do not believe compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We believe, however, it is reasonably likely the trend in environmental litigation, laws, and regulations will continue to be toward stricter standards. Such changes in the laws and regulations may require us to make additional capital expenditures which, while not currently estimable with certainty, are not presently expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
 We are strongly committed to economic, environmental, and socially sustainable development. As a result of this commitment, in 2008 we adopted the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (“EICC”) Code of Conduct, now titled 
10

Responsible Business Alliance ("RBA") Code of Conduct. The RBA Code of Conduct is a comprehensive code of conduct that addresses all aspects of corporate responsibility including labor, health and safety, the environment, business ethics, and related management system elements. It outlines standards to ensure working conditions in the electronic industry supply chain are safe, free from slavery and human trafficking, workers are treated with respect and dignity, manufacturing processes are environmentally sustainable and materials are sourced responsibly.
Policies, programs, and procedures implemented throughout KEMET are intended to ensure conformity with legal and regulatory requirements, the content of the RBA Code of Conduct, and customer contractual requirements related to social and environmental responsibility.
We fully support the position of the RBA, the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (“GeSI”), now titled Responsible Minerals Initiative ("RMI") and the Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center (“TIC”) in avoiding the use of conflict minerals which directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo and its adjoining countries, or in any region determined to be a conflict affected and high risk area. This policy and requirement has been communicated to all suppliers of conflict minerals and this policy is communicated publicly on our website. Our tantalum supply base has been and continues to be validated as conformant to the RMI's Responsible Minerals Assurance Program ("RMAP"). We will continue to work through the RMI and TIC towards the goal of greater transparency in the supply chain.
Summary of Activities to Develop a Transparent Supply Chain
We are actively involved in developing a transparent supply chain through our membership in the RMI. We were a member of the EICC/GeSI working group that developed the original Conflict Free Sourcing Progam assessment protocols and participated in the pilot implementation phase of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. We participate in smelter engagement to increase the number of conflict-free validated smelters globally, the development of due diligence guidance documents and the advancement of the industry adopted conflict minerals reporting template. We will rely on the RMAP independent third party audits to supplement our internal due diligence of conflict mineral suppliers and are monitoring the progress of these audits to ensure our supply chain is conflict free. We fully support section 1502 “Conflict Minerals” of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and are complying with all reporting requirements.
Global Code of Conduct and Mission, Vision and Values
KEMET maintains a Global Code of Conduct (“Code of Conduct”), which became effective August 1, 2010, as well as mission (“Mission”), vision (“Vision”) and values (“Values”) statements along with a set of core values, which became effective in June 2011. KEMET’s Mission is to help make the world a better, safer, more connected place to live. KEMET’s Vision is to be the world’s most trusted partner for innovative component solutions. KEMET’s Values embody the key expectations of how our employees should approach the work they do every day: One KEMET, Unparalleled Customer Experience, Ethics and Integrity, Talent Oriented, No Politics, The Math Must Work and Speed. The Global Code of Conduct and Mission, Vision and Values are applicable to all employees, officers, and directors of the Company. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding an amendment to, or waiver from a provision of our Code of Conduct, Mission, Vision and Values by posting such information on our website at http://www.kemet.com.
KEMET supports the Kisengo Foundation and certain other charitable endeavors in the Democratic Republic of Congo with periodic monetary donations.  Funds have been used toward building and supporting a new hospital and school as well as the installation of fresh water wells, solar street lighting, infrastructure improvements and a micro-agriculture project.
