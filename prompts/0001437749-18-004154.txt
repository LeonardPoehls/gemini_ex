Industry Background 
 
The EMS sector is the outsourced portion of the worldwide electronics assembly industry. There is currently considerable outsourcing of manufacturing by OEMs in response to rapidly changing markets, technologies and accelerating product life cycles as well as the need to lower total costs and convert typical fixed costs into a variable cost model.
 
Historically, OEMs were vertically integrated manufacturers that invested significantly in manufacturing assets and facilities around the world to manufacture, service and distribute their products. EMS originated as labor intensive functions were outsourced by OEMs to obtain additional capacity during periods of high demand. Early EMS providers were essentially subcontractors, providing production capacity on a transactional basis. However, with significant advances in manufacturing process technology, EMS providers developed additional capabilities and were able to improve quality and dramatically reduce OEMs’ costs. Furthermore, as the capabilities of EMS companies expanded, an increasing number of OEMs adopted and relied upon EMS outsourcing strategies. Over time, OEMs engaged EMS providers to perform a broader array of manufacturing services, including design and development activities. In recent years, EMS providers have further expanded their range of services to include advanced manufacturing, configuration, packaging and distribution and overall supply chain management. In addition, many OEMs are reducing the number of vendors from which outsourced services are purchased, and are partnering with EMS suppliers that offer broader expertise. 
 
By outsourcing manufacturing, OEMs take advantage of the technology and manufacturing expertise of EMS companies and focus on their core business, while leveraging the manufacturing efficiency and capital investment of EMS providers. OEMs use EMS providers to enhance their competitive position by:
 

• | Lowering Product Costs. EMS providers are better able to reduce total product costs due to electronic manufacturing expertise and higher utilization of manufacturing capacity spread over a wider range of product types. Due to their scale of operations as well as established and ongoing relationships with suppliers, EMS providers are able to achieve better pricing and better working capital management. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reducing Time to Market. Electronic products are experiencing shorter product life cycles, requiring OEMs to continually reduce the time required to bring new products to market. OEMs can significantly improve product development cycles and reduce time to market by benefiting from the expertise and infrastructure of EMS providers. This expertise includes capabilities relating to design, quick-turn prototype development and rapid ramp-up of new products to high volume production, with the critical support of worldwide supply chain management. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improving Supply Chain Management. OEMs that manufacture internally are faced with greater complexities in planning, sourcing, procurement and inventory management due to frequent design changes, short product life cycles and product demand fluctuations. OEMs can address these complexities by outsourcing to EMS providers that possess sophisticated supply chain management capabilities and can leverage significant component procurement advantages to lower product costs. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Accessing Advanced Manufacturing Capabilities and Process Technologies. Electronic products and electronic manufacturing technology have become increasingly sophisticated and complex, making it difficult for many OEMs to maintain the necessary technological expertise and focus required to efficiently manufacture products internally. By working closely with EMS providers, OEMs gain access to high quality manufacturing expertise and capabilities in the areas of advanced process, interconnect and test technologies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improving Access to Global Markets. OEMs are generally increasing their international activities in an effort to expand sales through access to foreign markets. EMS companies with worldwide capabilities are able to offer those OEMs global manufacturing solutions enabling them to meet local content requirements and to distribute products efficiently around the world at lower costs. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reducing Capital Investments. OEMs are able to reduce their capital investments in inventory, facilities and equipment by outsourcing their manufacturing to EMS providers and allocating their resources towards their core business activities. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Shift from a Fixed to Variable Cost Model. Through outsourcing, OEMs are able to shed substantial fixed costs of manufacturing and take advantage of EMS providers’ efficient facilities, resulting in a highly variable and efficient cost structure.

Visibility solutions are customized to support a range of requirements, including inventory visibility, master production schedule simulation, clear-to-build, available-to-promise, end-market demand steering, and service parts management. Kinaxis RapidResponse provides a single view of inventory across all SMTC facilities and inventory hub locations as well as a view of materials supply. Custom reports can be set up to automatically email within SMTC and to SMTC customers on regular intervals. This inventory and supply base liabilities dashboard has proven to be a valuable tool for both SMTC and our customers. Visibility solutions include intercompany processes and multi-node supply chains. 
 
The Company has a global commodity manager in Kowloon, Hong Kong who serves to improve access to the broad base of component suppliers in the Asia region and provides the Company with competitive pricing. The Hong Kong office manages component sourcing to support SMTC’s global operations.
 
SMTC Suppliers 
 
RapidResponse works hand-in-hand with custom electronical data interchange (“EDI”), business-to-business process that provides real-time and daily information exchange and transactions with suppliers. Through EDI programs, SMTC has an ongoing view into supplier on-hand inventories and is able to more effectively plan factory capacities and provide customer delivery commitments. 
 
With our web-based collaborative planning systems, our customers’ needs are integrated with our suppliers in a more efficient and cost effective manner than is achievable through traditional EDI. We believe our volume of procurement enhances our ability to obtain better pricing, influence component packaging and design and obtain supply of components in constrained markets. 
 
We generally order materials and components under our agreements with customers only to the extent necessary to satisfy existing customer orders or forecasts. We have implemented specific inventory management strategies with certain suppliers via vendor managed inventory programs into SMTC supply chain programs. Fluctuations in material costs typically are passed through to customers. We may agree, upon request from our customers, to temporarily delay shipments, which causes a corresponding delay in our revenue recognition and an increase in inventory. Ultimately, however, our customers generally are responsible for all materials purchased and goods manufactured on their behalf.

Our Competition 
 
The EMS industry is composed of numerous companies that provide a range of manufacturing services for OEMs, from PCBA, to design, prototyping, final system assembly, configuration, order fulfillment, repair and aftermarket services. The EMS market consists of contract manufacturers (“CMs”), and original design manufacturers (“ODMs”). CMs manufacture products that have been designed by the OEM; ODMs also design their own products, primarily commodities, and in many instances are in direct competition with the OEMs. SMTC participates in the mid-sized CM sector. 
 
CM providers fall within one of four tiers:
 
Large/Tier 1: Global operations with manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe and Asia, and low-cost manufacturing sites in Asia, Mexico and Eastern Europe. Large CMs annual revenues generally are greater than $2.0 billion. This includes Celestica Inc., Flextronics International Ltd., Jabil Circuit, Inc., Sanmina, Inc., Benchmark Electronics Inc. and Plexus Corp. 
 
Mid-size/Tier 2: Usually focused in one region such as North America, Europe or Asia, with facilities in that region supported by additional facilities in low-cost regions. Mid-sized CMs generally have annual revenues of up to $2.0 billion. This includes Sparton and Key Tronic Corp. 
 
Regional /Tier 3: Usually focused in North America and typically with minimum operations in low-cost geographic regions and less than $300 million in annual revenues. This includes IEC and Sigmatron. 
 
Small/Tier 4: Usually single facility operations, with annual revenues less than $20 million.
 
We compete with different companies depending on the type of service we are providing or the geographic area in which an activity takes place. Some of our competitors may have greater scale and provide a broader range of services than we offer. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the manufacturing services market are quality and range of services, design and technological capabilities, cost, location of facilities, responsiveness and flexibility.

In particular, we are subject to regulations pertaining to health and safety in the workplace and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing process.
 
          Our commitment is to conduct our business in such a way that protects and preserves the environment, health and safety of our employees, our customers and the communities where we live and operate. The Company cooperates with government agencies that have the mandate to verify compliance to relevant environmental laws.
 
The electronics industry is subject to the European Union’s Restrictions of Hazardous Substances, or RoHS, and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, or WEEE, directives. The State of California put into effect a similar measure under the Electronic Waste Recycling Act of 2003, which requires the California Department of Toxic Substances Control to adopt regulations to prohibit the sale of electronic devices if they are prohibited from sale in the European Union because they contain certain heavy metals. Parallel initiatives are being proposed in other jurisdictions, including several other states in the United States and in the People’s Republic of China. RoHS prohibits the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires industry OEMs to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components. SMTC’s sites are fully capable of producing RoHS compliant products as directed by our customers. In the case of WEEE, the compliance responsibility rests primarily with OEMs rather than with EMS companies. However, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their WEEE obligations. We are committed to comply with the directives/regulations that require disclosures regarding conflict minerals and measures taken to combat human trafficking and slavery. In particular, we are adopting best practices developed by industry groups, such as the Global e-Sustainability Initiative and the electronics industry citizenship coalition (“EICC”), to conduct our due diligence in these areas. We work collaboratively with our suppliers to encourage their compliance with the EICC's supply chain initiatives.

To date, the costs of compliance and environmental remediation have not been material. Nevertheless, additional or modified requirements may be imposed in the future. If such additional or modified requirements are imposed on us, or if conditions requiring remediation are found to exist, we may be required to incur additional expenditures.
 
Our Structure and Our History 
 
We are a Delaware Corporation incorporated in July 1998. Our present corporate structure resulted from the July 1999 combination of predecessor companies Surface Mount and HTM Holdings Inc. Subsequent to the combination, all of Surface Mount’s operating subsidiaries, other than SMTC Canada and Qualtron, Inc., became subsidiaries of HTM Holdings Inc. In 2011, we expanded our operations in San Jose, California with the acquisition of ZF Array Technology, Inc. (“ZF Array”), a privately held electronics manufacturing services provider. In 2012, the Asian entities of SMTC Electronics Dongguan Company Limited and SMTC Electronics (Suzhou) Company Limited were established. Our SMTC Electronics (Suzhou) Company Limited, China facility was closed in accordance with the restructuring plan as announced on May 15, 2017. The closure of the SMTC Electronics (Suzhou) Company Limited, China facility was initiated in the second quarter of 2017 and was substantially completed by the end of 2017.
Backlog 
 
Our backlog is typically a combination of purchase orders and forecasts. Our customers typically provide purchase orders for delivery of products due within 30 to 90 days. We are also provided additional demand beyond 90 days to drive material demand and perform resources and capacity planning. We do not believe that the backlog of expected product sales covered only by purchase orders is a meaningful measure of future sales since additional orders may be added, or orders rescheduled or cancelled. 
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 1,171 employees of which 1,110 are full-time employees. In addition, we employ varying levels of temporary employees as our production demands. Given the variable nature of our project flow and the quick response time required by our customers, it is critical that we are able to quickly adjust our production levels to maximize efficiency. To achieve this, our strategy has been to employ a skilled temporary labor force, as required. We use outside contractors to qualify our temporary employees on a site-by-site basis. Our production level temporary employees are compensated by the hour. We believe we are team-oriented, dynamic and results-oriented with an emphasis on customer service and quality at all levels. We believe this environment is a critical factor for us to be able to fully utilize the intellectual capital of our employees. Because of the surplus of available talent on the market, and the strength of our total compensation packages, to date we have not experienced any issues attracting skilled employees.
 
As of December 31, 2017, our only unionized employees were at our Mexico facility, representing a portion of our Mexican labor force. We have never experienced a work stoppage or strike and believe we have good employee relations.
