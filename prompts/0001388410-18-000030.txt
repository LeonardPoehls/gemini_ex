CORPORATE HISTORY
 
Formation and Development
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 6, 2005. On November 1, 2012, the Company, formerly Endeavor Power Corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiary Endeavor Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Parallax Diagnostics, Inc., a Nevada corporation, whereby Parallax Diagnostics became a wholly-owned subsidiary. On January 9, 2014, the Company changed its name to Parallax Health Sciences, Inc. 
 
The Company’s mission is simple; improving the quality of health care, while reducing costs. 
The Parallax business was founded on its point of care diagnostic business, Parallax Diagnostics, Inc., in 2010, when Parallax acquired the right, title, and interest, through an exclusive License with Montecito BioSciences, Ltd. (“MBS”), to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Target System, an Immunoassay point-of-care diagnostic testing system. Concurrently, through an Assignment Agreement with MBS, Parallax acquired the right, title, and interest to twenty-six (26) FDA-cleared tests in the area of infectious disease, medical conditions, drugs of abuse, cardiac and pregnancy, that are designed to be utilized with the Target System. 
 
The Company continually strives to identify solutions to the challenges facing the current healthcare system in the United States and markets around the world. The Company is committed to delivering quality products and services to patients, payers, healthcare insurers and stakeholders that are accessible and reasonable, and are built upon sound business models designed to provide for sustainable growth and continued increased value to the Parallax shareholders. 
 
Parallax’s current family of companies that serve as the foundation for its cross-over business model of operations include:
 
Parallax Diagnostics, Inc. ("Parallax Diagnostics" or "PDI") is the Company’s point of care diagnostic testing company focused on the exploitation of a proprietary diagnostic immunoassay testing platform and test cartridges for the areas of infectious diseases, cardiac markers, drugs of abuse and various other medical conditions. Parallax’s primary focus is to commercialize the Target System worldwide. PDI is currently pre-revenue.
 
RoxSan Pharmacy, Inc. (“RoxSan”), acquired in the 3rd quarter of 2015, is the Company’s 61-year-old, Beverly Hills, California based compound pharmacy that is licensed to operate in over 40 States and is one of the largest infertility pharmacies in the nation. RoxSan generated top line sales of over $22 million in 2016. 
 
Parallax Health Management, Inc. (formerly Qolpom, Inc.) (“PHM”) a Tucson, Arizona based Remote Patient Monitoring (“RPM”) business is the Company’s most recent acquisition, and represents an opportunity to develop products and services, and commercialize them, on a proprietary platform, in the RPM and Telehealth market, that will allow for systems integration with a number of third party services and solutions. In 2016, PHM initiated the generation of revenue through the deployment of its services and products.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
-----------------------

Overview
 
The Company’s principal focus is on personalized patient care through pharmacy services provided by RoxSan, remote health care services provided by Parallax Health Management, Inc. (formerly Qolpom, Inc.), and eventually through the Parallax Diagnostics Inc.'s medical diagnostic testing platform, which holds the exclusive license, with rights and title to the Target System, an Immunoassay point-of-care diagnostic testing system and certain Target System point of care immunoassay diagnostic tests.
 
Parallax’s three (3) divisions are: 
 

Medical Diagnostics | Parallax Diagnostics, Inc. | Point-of-care diagnostics Pre-revenue 
--------------------+----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pharmaceuticals | RoxSan Pharmacy, Inc. | 61-year-old Beverly Hills, CA pharmacy licensed in over 40 US states Generated over $22 million in 2016 
Remote Health Care | Parallax Health Management, Inc. | Patient-to-Medical regimen technology, remote patient monitoring and telehealth Generated just under $1 million during its initial trial campaign

 
Each of Parallax's divisions target a separate vertical market that complement each other and the Company's value proposition. In addition, the synergistic operational cross-over affords Parallax the ability to use built in economies of scale across multiple operating platforms. 
 
The Parallax Business Model
 
In the past 60 years, healthcare has transitioned from a direct relationship between doctor and patient, to one that has patients separated from their doctors by the introduction of a huge number of stakeholders, ranging from health insurers, employers, pharmacy benefit managers, imaging, diagnostic testing, lawyers, specialists and a plethora of others. The patient and healthcare provider both want the same thing: information, quality of service, transparency, value for their hard-earned dollars, and more time in their day.
 
Parallax has developed, acquired and licensed multiple proprietary and exclusive platforms, that provide services and products, across the healthcare continuum. These platforms are designed to allow for multiple points of reciprocal consideration, through innovative business models, that provide patients with increased quality of services and products, at reduced cost of time and money. They also provide healthcare providers with increased access to their patients, the ability to deliver better and more efficient service and increase their income from the services they supply.
 
Products and Services
 
Parallax believes that its products and services can provide solutions that mitigate rising costs, reduce waste in spending through transparency, reduce the amount of unnecessary services, and increase the health and wellness of patients before they are sick. 
 
The Pharmacy’s products and services range from pharmaceutical, infertility and compound drugs and medications to retail and over-the-counter drugs and products. RoxSan also provides door-to-door delivery, as well as overnight shipments.
 
Remote Health Care products include patent pending software and Mobile Apps and Services, as well as electronic kits and devices from third-party licensed platforms that are designated towards a patient’s primary health concern (i.e. diabetes, blood pressure, cardiovascular, general monitoring, etc.), and offer both audio and video options that interface with the patient’s healthcare providers. Prescription medication dosage monitoring is also available. 
 
The Cross-Over and Cross-Pollination Model 
 
The Company's business model is built on identifying opportunities represented by one market vertical that provides for a separate vertical to utilize one or more of its core operations. Although Parallax’s multiple operations are focused in separate vertical markets, Parallax has designed its business model to allow for cross-pollination and reciprocal transfer of value at multiple points in their respective economic food chains. 
 
As an example of the Company's cross-over and cross-pollination model, the nationwide sales infrastructure supporting RoxSan, can be utilized by Parallax’s Point-of-care Diagnostic system.
 
●
RoxSan Pharmacy, the compound and retail pharmacy, sells its drugs to doctors in over 40 US states, approximately 3,500 doctors in its client data base, both active and non-active; and 
 ●
Parallax Health Management, Inc., the remote healthcare system can provide a range of after-care products and services, and can sell its telehealth and remote patient monitoring services directly to the doctors being sold compounded medications; and 
 ●
Parallax Diagnostics, the point-of-care testing and diagnostics division, will be able to sell their testing platforms and tests to the RoxSan doctors for use with their patients. 

- 3 -

The Company's business strategy is to expand through organic growth, selective synergistic acquisition, and develop, license and or acquire, quality products and or services that complement the Parallax mission.
 
The Company believes that the current healthcare system is built on unsustainable models and significant challenges for all the stakeholders in the healthcare system. The Company strives to identify products, services and technologies that deliver solutions that fill a void in the current market for high quality high efficacy products and services delivered at reasonable and rational prices.
 
Management
 
Parallax is led by experienced veterans from the healthcare, technology, finance and management fields. The Company's disciplined and organized approach is balanced by its optimism for the future, and the opportunities present in the current healthcare market. The Parallax team is grounded in a belief that success in business is built on a combination of research, planning and execution.
 
At Parallax, management continually strives to identify solutions to the challenges facing the current healthcare system. Parallax and its management team of professionals is committed to delivering the highest quality products and services to patients, payers, healthcare insurers and stakeholders that are accessible and reasonable, and are built upon sound business models and economics that are designed to provide for sustainable growth and increased value to the Company's shareholders.
 
Operating Segments
 
Currently, the Company's business operations generate revenue through multiple economic models, ranging from cash payments, insurance reimbursements and pharmaceutical drug rebates derived from its compounding, retail and fertility business, to PHM’s initial remote patient monitoring activity, the deployment of its Good Health Outcomes Platform, and the sale of third-party vendor devices.
 
The Company currently operates with the following three (3) segments:
 
●
Pharmacy

RoxSan provides a full range of pharmacy services including retail, compounding and fertility medications. RoxSan generates net revenues primarily by dispensing prescription drugs, both through local channels by direct delivery as well as mail order. RoxSan also sells a wide assortment of general merchandise, including over-the-counter drugs, beauty products and cosmetics, seasonal merchandise and convenience foods, through the Company’s pharmacy. The pharmacy is fully licensed and qualified to conduct business in over 40 US States. 
 
●
Remote Patient Monitoring 

PHM provides a first-of-its-kind technology platform that provides for the complete remote patient care delivery system: the patent-pending Good Health Outcomes, which utilizes proprietary software and technology to bridge clinical behavioral science with technology and logistics for payers, providers and clinical professionals across a variety of wellness and clinical devices, including both fitness and clinical applications. PHM’s Good Health Outcomes is a secure and scalable platform for collecting, transmitting and analyzing biometric, pharmaceutical, and health data to healthcare providers, primarily hospitals, accredited nursing operations, and physicians.
 
PHM generates revenues through fees charged for the license and utilization of its proprietary system that provides software integrations of the Good Health Outcomes platform. Additionally, PHM generates incremental revenues through the delivery of acute, post-acute and chronic health patient management software systems that enable PHM customers to bill for and collect payments from patients and third-party payers for telemonitoring and remote services that they deliver. 
 
●
Corporate 

The Corporate Segment provides management and administrative services to support the Company and consists of certain aspects of the Company’s executive management, corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, and corporate information technology and finance departments. In addition, the Corporate Segment supports the costs and operating expenses related to the continued development and exploitation of the Company's proprietary medical diagnostic and monitoring platform and processes, which remains the Company's primary focus. 

PARALLAX DIAGNOSTICS, INC. 
---------------------------------------------
TARGET SYSTEM and DIAGNOSTIC TESTING PLATFORM

Overview 
 
Parallax Diagnostics, Inc. (“PDI” or "Parallax Diagnostics") is a company focused on the development of point-of-care diagnostics, with an emphasis on its Target System testing platform and novel applications that detect and/or monitor infectious diseases, cardiac markers and drug of abuse assays. PDI holds exclusive licenses, in perpetuity, to a line of proprietary, patented and/or patent-pending, previously FDA cleared, point-of-care diagnostic tests to be utilized with its single platform diagnostic testing Target System. PDI, with its products and products in development, offers the potential to transform the diagnostic landscape by transitioning critical tests from the centralized lab directly to the hands of the physician or clinicians. 
 
Parallax Diagnostics is currently pre-revenue and continues to pursue viable opportunities for the commercialization of its product. Additionally, Parallax Diagnostics has sought to identify strategies that would make its proposition more valuable and competitive. The Company has made the strategic decision to keep the Parallax Diagnostics product line off the market, and has spent the last few years prosecuting its patents. Since the inception of Parallax Diagnostics, and the Company has been issued patents on core technology of its technology for its Target System. In 2014, 2015 and 2017, Parallax Diagnostics and its license partner, Montecito BioSciences, Ltd. ("MBS"), received patents on its mobile testing platform in conjunction with its Target System cartridges in the United States, China, Hong Kong, Macao, and India. To this end, the Company has pursued patents around its foundational technology and the SPARKS Mobile diagnostic reader. PDI also has a technology that was previously cleared by the FDA technology that is being used as a platform for a test that will detect CD4 and CD8 cells which in turn determine a patient’s immune status.

History of the PDI Target System Technology
 

1982 | The Target System was developed and produced by the late Dr. James Parker. In January 1982, James Parker founded V-Tech, Inc. a biomedical and Plastics Company, combining established immunodiagnostic technologies with innovative medical plastic products ("V-Tech"). Mr. Parker’s goal was to develop innovative diagnostic tests and testing systems. During his career, Mr. Parker successfully patented over thirty (30) biomedical related products. 
-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1985 | Late in 1985, Mr. Parker expanded V-Tech’s capabilities by acquiring Organon Diagnostics' 22,500 sq. ft. facility and technical scientific staff. Under Mr. Parker’s direction, the acquisition had an immediate impact on V-Tech’s pursuit of its major commitment to translate emerging research concepts into useful diagnostic and health care products. 
1986 | V-Tech introduced its first product on membrane, the Target HCG Test, in the third quarter of 1986. The commercial success of that first product utilizing membrane technology not only spawned a host of additional new tests introduced between 1988 and 1993 but brought V-Tech to the attention of companies such as Miles Laboratories, DuPont, for whom V-Tech successfully developed tests on membrane for agricultural diagnostics, Difco Laboratories, which joint-ventured the application of several analytes. 
1986-2001 | The Target System was manufactured and marketed by V-Tech to medical distributors, hospitals and various government agencies (D.O.D., and G.S.A.). V-Tech owned and operated two manufacturing and distribution facilities, 38,000 and 48,000 sq. ft. in Pomona and the City of Industry, California, respectively. All development and manufacturing, together with FDA compliance laboratory processes, were conducted at these two FDA certified facilities. 
2001-2004 | The Target System inventor and V-Tech founder, Dr. James Parker, died of an aneurism in October 2001, just as PDI was beginning to initiate significant sales. Colleagues and family members believe that the aneurism was a direct result of a suspicious circumstances surrounding a fall down an escalator in Paris, France, shortly before Dr. Parker was to give a speech at a international conference of diagnostic professionals. V-Tech was in disarray and lay dormant for a number of years under stewards with non-compatible backgrounds. 
2004-2006 | Victor Parker, Esq., son of James Parker approached Ted Withrow (“Withrow”), a financier, biomedical executive, entrepreneur and inventor, to help him continue with his father's vision of providing high quality low cost diagnostics in or outside of a hospital. Subsequently, Mr. Withrow approached Dr. Jorn Gorlach, a successful scientist, entrepreneur, biomedical executive and inventor, to join him in founding a new company charged with the commercialization of the Target System and the fulfillment of Dr. Parker’s vision. By expanding and applied innovative development to the existing platform, Messer’s Withrow and Gorlach were able to lead the new company, Montecito BioSciences, Ltd., into the development of mobile diagnostic and healthcare platform. MBS applied for and was granted patents covering its mobile technology and Target System test cartridge and is currently in the pre-prototype stage of development. SPARKS Mobile, the handheld, mobile technology, will be a next generation version of the VT-1000 reader, and was put into development along with new product segments and market strategies for the reorganization of the Target System technologies and testing platform into MBS. MBS entered into an exclusive license of twenty-six (26) FDA 510K cleared tests and the FDA 510K cleared immunoassay reader and an Assignment Agreement for the patented and patent-pending applications covering innovations to the Target System and to the business plan. The following list represents historical distributor that sold the Target Antigen Detection System Diagnostic Platform, including the TARGET VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer and a number of the Company’s FDA approved tests in a commercial setting:

Product Strategy 
 
In recent years, there has been a continuing shift from the use of laboratory-based analyzers to point-of-care (“POC”) tests that can be performed in a matter of minutes. Unlike the centralized clinical laboratory segment of the diagnostic market, which is mature and highly competitive, the POC market is still in its relatively early stages. According to the recent worldwide research reports, however, such as the 2010 Worldwide IVD Market, by the research firm Kalorama Information, the growth rate of the POC market continues to rise. Although certain simple, single analyte diagnostic tests have been developed, such tests have remained incapable of precise and highly sensitive quantitative measurements. As a result, medical tests that require precise quantization of the target analyte have remained the domain of immunoassay analyzers in the centralized laboratory.
 
Point-of-care diagnostic kits typically consist of test strips that the health care provider applies a patient’s sample to and then reads the strip either visually or with an instrument in order to determine a result.  They are simple to use, fast, disposable and reliable within an acceptable range. More sensitive analytes or tests requiring quantitative analysis and definitive antibody screening needed in most situations, must be sent out to a diagnostic lab, and hours or days later results arrive. These tests are comparatively complex, expensive, and time consuming; only centralized diagnostic facilities can manage sample handling and the cost of instruments and reagents.  A point-of-care instrument that has the advantage of a test strip device in terms of ease of use and rapid results along with ELISA-like capabilities for major diseases would circumscribe diagnosis routinely within the course of a patient visit. This could disrupt the current model. The Company is planning to develop just such a device that it intends to sell to doctors and health care providers.
 
The commercial success of the current generation of small, simple to use diagnostic devices which provide rapid results in POC applications has been limited by their inability to provide precise, highly sensitive, quantitative measurement.  Despite these limitations, the rapid increase in discovery of individual markers of disease processes, coupled with the advancements in rapid detection technologies, has made these tools available to medical professionals on a wide scale and POC diagnostics are quickly becoming a high growth industry.
 
The Company’s Target System (the system includes the VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer, the Target Antigen Detection Cartridge and associated reagents) technology addresses these limitations by applying sophisticated immunochemical and optical methods to detect and quantify analytes present in various human specimens, including blood, urine, and feces. Data indicates that sensitivity will be comparable to expensive and complicated laboratory-based analyzers. The Company believes that there is market potential for advanced POC diagnostic products that provide quick and accurate diagnosis during a patient visit, shortening the decision time to medical intervention and minimizing the need for additional patient follow-up, thereby reducing overall health care delivery costs.
 
The Company also believes that there is growth opportunity for the exploitation of its Target System platform in developing nations and regions such as Africa, India, South America, Eastern Europe, Russia and Asia as well as developed markets of North America and Western Europe. One of the first initiatives to be developed for this market will combine the Company’s SPARKS Mobile (a portable hand-held diagnostic analyzer based on the VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer technology, but smaller and more portable), currently in development, with a test for the monitoring of AIDS/TB patients through the use of a proprietary rapid point-of-care immunoassay CD4-CD8 test called PROMISE CD4, also in development.
 
The Diagnostics Products
 
The Company’s assets include a previously FDA-cleared VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer and more than two dozen FDA 510(k) cleared diagnostic tests. The Desktop Analyzer and immunoassay system incorporates a flow-through rapid antigen test platform configuration that has the ability to produce high-performance quantitative blood test results with the ease of rapid qualitative diagnostic strips.  The Company has patents and patent applications related to its current and future products, as well as methods for future test development. The Target VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer is ideally suited for rapid development and commercialization of all new tests that may be introduced.
VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer: Quantitative and Qualitative Immunoassay
 
The Company’s VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer was FDA 510(k) cleared and is capable of rapidly detecting qualitative and quantitative data for the Company’s FDA-cleared Target Platform tests. The VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer is used for all Target Platform Tests, allowing for clinical personnel to be trained once and also gives consistent results for either qualitative or quantitative testing. The Company plans to develop the SPARKS Mobile, a hand-held analyzer unit, similar in size to a mobile phone/PDA, which will be based on the VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer (see Products in Development).
Target Antigen Detection System (“TADS”)
 
The Target Antigen Detection System consists of a unique disposable cartridge with reagents capable of testing multiple test markers, combined with the VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer. The TADS requires a small amount of sample and provides results in minutes.  The simplicity of the fully loaded disposable test cartridge and subsequent ease-of-use of the instrument helps to alleviate the technical burden on medical staff and makes patient diagnosis more efficient.
 
The Company’s Target Antigen Detection System is a departure from the standard devices typical to the rapid testing markets. The device is part of the manufacturer’s qualitative and quantitative “Target System Diagnostics Platform,” which offers an array of improved modifications and features to the traditional qualitative and semi-quantitative flow-through immunoassay test. With its platform uniformity, vacuum pump, absorption layer for sample overflow, and complete compatibility with single and multi-light source reflectometer technology, the TADS cartridge is a unique collection of tests for qualitative and quantitative detection diseases and of conditions. The TADS cartridge utilizes a vacuum technology to deposit specimen samples uniformly on test membranes.  The Vacuum Control Flow Device provides a vacuum pump action, which reduces test time and ensures maximum contact with the membrane antibodies.  This collection device allows for numerous tests to be incorporated. The vacuum specimen filtration and excess specimen absorption is built right in.
 
Additional Products Planned for Development
 
The Target System provides the platform for the development of a series of quantitative tests for important diagnostic applications that can provide results at a patient's bedside, in a doctor's office, in the emergency room, in a clinic, in an ambulance, on the battlefield, on site agri-business locations, rural and economically disadvantaged areas. The Target System expects to meet the POC diagnostic market criteria as follows:
 
●
Rapid turnaround time 
 ●
Direct application of a non-critical volume or placement of sample directly into instrument 
 ●
Disposable device or minimal maintenance required 
 ●
Minimal technical expertise required 
 ●
Positive identification and specimen tracking strategy that eliminates specimen identification errors 
 ●
Simple strategy for calibration and QC 
 ●
Transferability of data to the LIS or HIS 
 ●
Agreement of result with accepted "Gold Standard" tests 
 ●
Affordable cost

The Company also believes that there is growth opportunity for the exploitation of the Target System platform in developing nations and regions such as Africa, India, South America, Eastern Europe, Russia and Asia as well as developed markets of North America and Western Europe. One of the first initiatives for the development of this specific market will be to combine the SPARKS Mobile, the Company’s hand-held analyzer (the portable version of its VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer), with a test for the monitoring of HIV/AIDS patients and Tuberculosis patients, through the use of the Company’s proprietary rapid POC immunoassay PROMISE CD4 quantitative test, also planned for development.
 
The Company’s testing system is not limited to HIV or AIDS diagnostics. The test format has been applied in the past to viral and bacterial infections (e.g., Rubella, Rotavirus, Strep. A) and can be adapted towards other epidemics. Diseases like malaria, cholera, hepatitis, yellow fever, or West Nile virus and other viral diseases present increasing health threats to large populations in the world, with major existing problems at the stage of proper diagnosis.  The Company believes that it can adapt its VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer and SPARKS Mobile to the rapid, simple, point-of-care diagnosis of almost all of these diseases without the requirement of additional equipment. Further, the Company believes that the combination of a mobile, hand-held testing device with a large number of different tests provided by a family of cartridges will improve the ability of current health care and disease diagnostics in a fast majority of today’s underserved regions. In addition, the Target System Platform also allows for the monitoring of environmental components influencing the health of populations, such as the presence of toxins in soil and drinking water and contamination of food supply.
 
The Target System Hand-Held Analyzer: SPARKS Mobile
 
The Company’s next generation Target System Analyzer, the SPARKS Mobile, a hand-held analyzer, will include a small, rapid testing format, in conjunction with a hand-held data acquisition and test reading device. The SPARKS Mobile will be a re-engineered version of the Company’s previously FDA-approved VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer.
 
Whether searching for markers in the blood stream, or diagnosing a pathogen in urine, the Company’s SPARKS Mobile will be a portable tool for rapid diagnostics. The SPARKS Mobile will also provide an improvement in POC diagnostics and applications in countries with limited health care infrastructures and geographic limitations, both of which are of paramount importance in the combat against infectious diseases and in the fight against proliferation of endemic and pandemic diseases. This innovative SPARKS Mobile will allow for a fast (minutes instead of hours or days) performance of tests at the point-of-care and will only require a test cartridge and a small number of ready-to-use solutions in preformatted quantities. Moreover, the SPARKS Mobile will include the ability to store patient information, test data, and QC data, and transmit data through wireless connections.
 
The SPARKS Mobile design goals will plan to:
 
●
achieve a portable monitoring system, which is compatible with proven and reliable ELISA-based target system technology. 
 ●
expand readout capabilities to provide a mobile testing and monitoring platform. 
 ●
increase the economy of scale and scope of the diagnostics and monitoring platform by the development of additional utility of the device without redundant infrastructure investments (additional data acquisition of patients, additional tests for other, predominant diseases). 
 
The basic design of the Company’s SPARKS Mobile is based on the same 510(k) cleared technology employed in its VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer and is compatible with existing Test Cartridges. However, a number of innovative features will be integrated into the design to meet customer and patient needs:
 
●
High Infrared Light Spectrum.  
 ●
Easy Field Upgrades 
 ●
No Change of Equipment 
 ●
Printer Hook-up Capability 
 ●
Low Entry Cost for New Test Development and Analysis 
 ●
Safety, Security and Accuracy by design 
 ●
Desk to Docking Station: Smart Phone Capability 
 
Market Opportunities 
 
In recent years, there has been a continuing shift from the use of laboratory-based analyzers to more technologically advanced point-of-care tests that can be performed in a matter of minutes. Unlike the centralized clinical laboratory segment, which is mature and highly competitive, the point-of-care market is still a relatively early stage market. Although certain simple single analyte diagnostic tests have been developed, such tests have remained incapable of precise and highly sensitive quantitative measurements. As a result, medical tests that require precise quantization of the target analyte have remained the domain of immunoassay analyzers.
 
Diagnostic tests performed outside the central laboratory or decentralized testing is generally known as point-of-care (POC). Over the years, the increasing introduction of transportable, portable, and handheld instruments has resulted in the migration of POC testing from the hospital environment to a range of medical environments including the workplace, home, disaster care and most recently, convenience clinics. Moreover, POC test devices have contributed significantly to the growth of the overall diagnostics market over the past 10 years. As more diagnostic manufacturers pursue CLIA waiver status for their POC devices and CE Mark for POC or self-use. At the same time, more decentralized test venues invest in non-waived rapid tests and instruments. POC testing appears to be headed for an even bigger role in diagnosis and monitoring patient care. 
 
The Global In-Vitro Diagnostics market is expected to grow to $69.1 billion by 2017, up from $49.2 billion in 2012. The growth represents a 7% compounded annual growth rate in five years. Self-testing is the biggest trend fueling the growth. The self-testing market is poised to grow at a CAGR of 9.3% from 2013 to 2018, to reach $27.5 billion by 2018. The growth is being driven by devices aimed at making acute care more efficient. There is a concerted effort to reduce time spent in expensive intensive care units and in the hospital in general. More tests and technologies have been adapted to serve the needs of physician offices and home testing.
 
Key Drivers
 
The two factors that are significant to the rapid growth of POC testing are technology advancements and health care economics. The development of new and improved technologies has resulted in the ability to make evidence-based medical decisions that improve patient outcomes and reduce patient acuity, criticality, morbidity and mortality. Quicker diagnosis of infectious agents can also permit the earlier prescription of appropriate medications, thereby potentially shortening the duration of illness. Additionally, the economic climate is driving significant changes in the manner in which patients will be tested and how results are delivered. Recent revisions to government regulations, together with growing patient and insurer pressures on hospitals and physicians have increased incentives to reduce overall patient healthcare costs while providing a higher level of care to a greater number of patients. One cost-cutting measure is to reduce the high cost of diagnostic testing carried out in central laboratory sites.
Limitations
 
Each of the screening devices described above have limitations in their utility and range of application. Many screening devices have been adopted from their use in clinical laboratories and, when applied to POC application, required special handling of the specimen samples (blood, urine, and feces) and decreased sensitivity and/or specificity.

Competitive Landscape
 
There are approximately 40 to 50 companies in the point-of care (“POC”) diagnostic industry in the U.S. and approximately another 100 outside the U.S. The POC space can be broken down into various sub-sets such as molecular biologist developing reagents, and markers to diagnostic equipment and test development companies, as well as companies who do neither and focus on marketing tests, equipment and assays.  Most notably in the POC space are the large pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer, Roche, Abbott Labs, ThermoFisher and others.  The Company’s specific competitive landscape is tied to its patent pending process involving its SPARKS Mobile Analyzer and Target System Platform In-Vitro Tests.  There are a number of companies developing mobile devices to perform a host of health industry-related services and the Company believes that more companies will enter the mobile diagnostic space in the next few years.   The industry has yet to develop a standardized point-of-care immunoassay platform for any device to be integrated into.  The goal of the Company’s SPARKS Mobile Analyzer is to deliver a device that adds immediate value to health providers, patients and health insurance companies.  The Company’s primary goal is to create a mobile platform that could integrate and utilize the flow-through process of the Company’s Target System Platform and offer the healthcare provider a system that is fully interoperable and ubiquitous with a potentially large number of in vitro tests.  There are other test platforms in the space, but the Company has filed a patent on the process of its SPARKS Mobile Analyzer and its TADS Cartridge. There can be no assurance that the Company’s POC device will prove to be competitive with the other POC devices under development.
 
Until the Company secures a minimum of three million dollars ($3,000,000) of additional capital to operate for the next eighteen months the Company will remain highly vulnerable from the Company’s competition. The Company anticipates the need for a minimum of an additional six million ($6,000,000) dollars of investment capital will be required for it to achieve its goal of developing a commercially viable rapid point-of-care CD4-8 immune status test and its proposed mobile SPARKS Mobile version of its FDA Approved VT 1000 Desktop Analyzer. There can be no assurance that such amount will prove adequate to develop the Company’ products. Furthermore, the Company’s competition has significantly greater resources that it can deploy and anytime to head off competition.

Barriers to Use
 
The main barriers and constraints to the use of rapid diagnostic tests can be put into three main categories: 
 
Acceptability:
Rapid tests need to be acceptable to policymakers, clinicians, and patients. Tests need to have sufficient sensitivity and specificity and need to have an adequate predictive value. Ease-of-use is critical for point-of-care use by clinicians. Culturally appropriate specimens and credible results are important if rapid tests are to be accepted by patients. 
Affordability:
Many rapid diagnostic tests are more expensive than the tests or syndromic algorithms they are intended to replace. Decreasing per-test costs, carefully designing diagnostic algorithms, and educating end users about the cost-savings of more efficient use of therapeutic drugs are important means of maximizing rapid test affordability. 
Availability:
Rapid diagnostic tests are not always available in developing countries. Most tests have limited shelf lives, and many countries have weak public and private sector procurement and distribution systems. The consistency and quality of imported tests can also be issues. To address these constraints, local government regulations, quality assurance, shelf life testing, and distribution systems all need to be assessed and improved. The Company will initially control all of the manufacturing of its Target System test cartridges and Desk Top Analyzer and SPARKS Mobile Analyzer in conjunction with Montecito. 
Reimbursement:
The ability to gain scale in reimbursement across a wide number of test is still a challenge for point of care diagnostic companies such as Parallax.

Generally, the Company and Montecito BioSciences, Ltd. will own improvements to the basic technology platform in exclusivity.
 
Government Regulations
 
The long legal journey toward medical device regulation began with the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906. Medical devices were not included, as no one envisioned how technology would grow increasingly complex, and would ultimately require regulation. The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 gave FDA authority to ensure the safety and effectiveness of a range of life-saving medical devices, while also protecting the public from fraudulent devices. The Amendments:
 
●
defined a medical device, 
 ●
established three device classes (I, II, and III), 
 ●
identified pathways to market, 
 ●
established Advisory Panels, and 
 ●
set clinical investigation requirements. 
 
Subsequent legislation strengthened the FDA’s regulatory authority. The following table identifies the legislation and significance for the Major Medical Device:  
 

Legislation | Significance 
---------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 | ●Established Quality System requirements 
 | ●Supported post market surveillance 
 | ●Allowed FDA discretion for PMAs brought to panel 
FDA Modernization Act of 1997 | ●Supported for early collaboration, expanded Class I and Class II exemptions 
 | ●Set the "least burdensome provision"* 
 | ●Supported dispute resolution 
 | ●Established evaluation of automatic Class III designation (giving the sponsor the opportunity to request lower classification due to a minimal risk device, known as "de novo" review) 
 | ●Mandated free and open participation by all interested persons 
Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA) of 2002 | ●Established a fee schedule for most types of device submissions to achieve shorter review times 
 | ●Requires FDA to include pediatric experts on the panel for a product intended for pediatric use 
FDA Modernization Act of 2007 | ●Reauthorized and expanded MDUFMA 


- 9 -

The least burdensome provision allows industry and FDA to consider the least burdensome appropriate means of evaluating a device’s effectiveness when there is a reasonable likelihood of its approval. The intent is to help expedite the availability of new device technologies without compromising scientific integrity in the decision-making process or FDA's ability to protect the public health. This provision does not lower the standard for premarket clearance.
 
Premarket Approval (PMA)
 
PMA refers to the scientific and regulatory review necessary to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III devices or devices that were found not substantially equivalent to a Class I or II predicate through the 510(k) processes. PMA is the most involved process. To reasonably assure that a device is safe and effective, PMA requires valid scientific evidence that the probable benefits to health from the intended use of a device outweigh the probable risks, and that the device will significantly help a large portion of the target population. Sources of valid scientific evidence may include well controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, historical controls, well documented case histories by qualified experts, and robust human experience. Independence is an important concept for PMAs, meaning that each PMA should establish the safety and effectiveness of the device under review, and that data about one device cannot be used to support another.  Examples of PMAs include digital mammography, minimally invasive and non-invasive glucose testing devices, implanted defibrillators, and implantable middle ear devices.
 
Summary Comparison of 510(k) and PMA
 

510(k) Submissions | PMA Submissions 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
●primarily for Class II devices | ●primarily for Class III devices 
●a Class I or II pre-amendment or legally marketed device (predicate) exists | ●a Class I or II pre-amendment or legally marketed device (predicate) does not exist
●third party review option is available for devices not requiring clinical data | ●device is life supporting and/or has potential risk to patient 
●documented proof of Substantial Equivalence to a predicate is required | ●documented safety and effectiveness data for the device is required 

 
Post-Approval Studies
 
The FDA can impose requirements at the time of approval of a PMA or HDE, or by regulation afterwards. One requirement may be the need for post-approval studies. The CDRH Post-Approval Studies Program helps ensure that well designed post-approval studies are conducted effectively and efficiently and in the least burdensome manner. Post-approval studies should not be used to evaluate unresolved premarket issues that are important to the initial establishment of device safety and effectiveness.
 
With post-approval studies, FDA can evaluate device performance and potential problems when the device is used more widely than in clinical trials and over a longer period of time. This allows FDA to build in accountability and gather essential post market information, including: 
 
●
longer-term performance of the device (for example, effects of re-treatments and product changes) 
 ●
community performance (clinicians and patients) 
 ●
effectiveness of training programs 
 ●
sub-group performance 
 ●
outcomes of concern – real and potential 
 
Manufacturing
 
The Company does not intend to manufacture in house, with the exception of prototype and small batch production of tests for clinical trials and in-house testing. The Company is required to use manufacturers who operate under Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”). A GMP is a production and testing practice that helps to ensure a quality product. Many countries have legislated that pharmaceutical and medical device companies must follow GMP procedures, and have created their own GMP guidelines that correspond with their legislation. Basic concepts of all of these guidelines remain more or less similar to the ultimate goals of safeguarding the health of the patient as well as producing good quality medicine, medical devices or active pharmaceutical products. In the U.S. a drug may be deemed adulterated if it has passed all of the specifications tests but is found to be manufactured in a condition which violates current good manufacturing practice guidelines. Therefore, complying with GMP is a mandatory aspect in pharmaceutical manufacturing.
 
Although there are a number of them, all guidelines follow a few basic principles:
 
●
Manufacturing processes are clearly defined and controlled. All critical processes are validated to ensure consistency and compliance with specifications. 
 ●
Manufacturing processes are controlled, and any changes to the process are evaluated. Changes that have an impact on the quality of the drug are validated as necessary. 
 ●
Instructions and procedures are written in clear and unambiguous language. (Good Documentation Practices) 
 ●
Operators are trained to carry out and document procedures. 
 ●
Records are made, manually or by instruments, during manufacture that demonstrate that all the steps required by the defined procedures and instructions were in fact taken and that the quantity and quality of the drug was as expected. Deviations are investigated and documented. 
 ●
Records of manufacture (including distribution) that enable the complete history of a batch to be traced are retained in a comprehensible and accessible form. 
 ●
The distribution of the drugs minimizes any risk to their quality. 
 ●
A system is available for recalling any batch of drug from sale or supply. 
 ●
Complaints about marketed drugs are examined, the causes of quality defects are investigated, and appropriate measures are taken with respect to the defective drugs and to prevent recurrence. 
 ●
GMP guidelines are not prescriptive instructions on how to manufacture products. They are a series of general principles that must be observed during manufacturing. When a company is setting up its quality program and manufacturing process, there may be many ways it can fulfill GMP requirements. It is the company's responsibility to determine the most effective and efficient quality process.

Distribution
 
The Company has not yet commenced commercial operations, and thus it has yet to develop methods of distribution for its products beyond the business plan stage.
 
In order to commercially sell the Company’s VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer, the Company must have it manufactured under GMP. The Company can and will provide demonstrations of its VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer capabilities to potential customers.
 
The Company will need to secure additional capitalization before it can acquire additional antibody markers, produce additional Target System cartridges or produce its VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer under GMP.
 
Principal Suppliers
 
The Company has not yet commenced commercial operations, and thus has yet to establish principal suppliers of its product line. 
 


ROXSAN PHARMACY, INC. 
-------------------------------------
COMPOUND and RETAIL PHARMACY SERVICES

Overview
 
RoxSan Pharmacy, Inc. ("RoxSan”), was incorporated on February 16, 1996, in the state of California, and is located in Beverly Hills, California. Prior to its incorporation in 1996, RoxSan was a privately-owned company providing pharmacy services since the early 1960s.
 
RoxSan is the oldest continuingly operated pharmacy in Beverly Hills and is a well-known commodity to the residents, providing retail, compound, infertility, wellness, anti-aging and sexual health products and services for over 60 years.
 
RoxSan’s mission is to deliver innovative, meaningful personalized medicines to patients by providing health care professionals cutting edge tools to leverage their knowledge and individualize patients’ treatment plans. RoxSan’s favorable pricing is competitive with other pharmacies that provide compounding services, but RoxSan exceptional customer care is what has proven to be the key to its success and longevity. RoxSan caters individually to patients through customized products, speedy home delivery, and having an on-call readily accessible pharmacy team. RoxSan can also educate its medical providers through scheduled seminars with its pharmacists. In addition, RoxSan’s parent company owns a Remote Health Monitoring company that can provide doctors and patients with live, interactive healthcare through its monitoring devices (see section entitled Parallax Health Management, Inc.).
 
RoxSan is a full-service retail, sterile and non-sterile compounding and fertility pharmacy licensed in the State of California and over 40 other states, and is VPP Certified (see National Accreditation). RoxSan not only provides commercial pharmaceuticals to its patients, but also specializes in customized compounded medications for individual patient needs based on prescriber recommendations. RoxSan’s current area of expertise includes pain management with a focus on non-addictive compounded topical pain creams, wound care, scar healing, and podiatry care compounds.
 
RoxSan generates net revenues primarily by dispensing prescription drugs, through local channels by direct delivery as well as mail order. RoxSan also sells a wide assortment of general merchandise, including over-the-counter drugs, beauty and cosmetic products, seasonal merchandise and convenience foods. Management developed a system of operations for RoxSan that focused on differentiating unique business markets for its services and developed additional areas of focus. Currently, RoxSan operates three distinct business units comprised of:

Management created the position of Director of Compliance at RoxSan and put a senior pharmacist as the Director. Management developed a strategic plan covering its Regulatory Compliance goals. The first goal was to create foundational standard operating procedures in the filling, processing, and shipping of prescriptions. 
 
Under this program an audit report ("Audit Report") was discovered that was previously discarded by the prior ownership as having “no relevance” as to the results of the findings in that audit. This audit was part of a due diligence requirement imposed by the Company upon the prior owner before the acquisition, which was to have a third-party organization verify that the pharmacy was operating within compliance of state regulatory demands. The Audit Report dated prior to the acquisition, which was discovered in abandoned files, indicated that several areas of operation of the pharmacy were in violation of the most fundamental compliance rules, and strict warnings as to the consequences of what would happen to the pharmacy’s licenses if these areas were not immediately corrected. The Seller did not provide this “material” information while in due diligence prior to the acquisition. All areas recommended in the Audit Report to be corrected, were in fact implemented by the current ownership.

State Pharmacy Licenses
The former owner had developed a well-documented contentious relationship with the California Board of Pharmacy as well as a number of other states in which the previous owner was accused of regulatory violations. There were also states that had suspended RoxSan’s Licenses under the prior ownership to operate in their state. The new management began an aggressive program in each state, to appeal to the State Pharmacy Boards to reinstate the licenses. It became apparent that many individual members on several state Boards of Pharmacy, including the California Board of Pharmacy, the Nevada Board of Pharmacy and the Arizona Board of Pharmacy, had an extremely negative perception of the former owner. 
 
With the new management entering into the picture, the negative perception became extremely positive toward RoxSan’s new ownership, and its new Compliance Program. Thus far, RoxSan has obtained pharmacy licenses in over 40 US states and is seeking to obtain licensing in the remaining states. As a result of the efforts of new management, all of these issues were corrected, and the pharmacy is currently operating in an entirely new status of having great relations with each of the previously strained relationships with individual state Boards of Pharmacy. 
 
Pharmacy Benefit Management
The former owner had created a negative and challenging relationship with Payers and Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM’s) as well as the cancellation of some pharmacy network contracts with PBM contracts that control the approvals for reimbursements for several health insurers. The new management established a plan of action and standard operating procedures to follow as well as address the criteria for contract re-approvals with the PBM’s. 
 
RoxSan Pharmacy has become qualified and fully accredited member of FocusScript’s Compounding Pharmacy Network enabling RoxSan to participate in the Pharmacy Benefit Management Program for one of the largest health insurers in the United States. As of this update approximately 5% of the Compound Pharmacy’s in the US have been able to achieve this accreditation.
 
A market development has occurred that has produced a payer reaction to the exorbitantly high pricing trends for compound pain medications. That development has affected the viability of the compound pain medication management industry due to rejections and many of the ingredients becoming “non-covered”. RoxSan has developed a program to restructure the pharmacy’s approach to creating a more “ethically” based pricing structure with extraordinarily high efficacy formularies and is working with several of the industry’s leading PBM’s in pursuit of partnership arrangements. 
 
National Accreditation
In addition, under the new management, RoxSan Pharmacy passed the inspection from the Verified Pharmacy Program (VPP) as part of the National Association of the Board of Pharmacy.  This was a significant accomplishment, considering that the prior ownership had failed in passing the VPP inspection in the past. Passing the VPP inspection is an exhaustive process requiring high levels of regulatory systems and compliance. This accomplishment was achieved in less than one year under the newly restructured operating compliance program under the new ownership, which included strict adherence to documentation retention and categorization. 
Human Resources
It was determined that there were personnel issues that RoxSan’s pharmacists, technicians and general operations employees had with the prior ownership. These issues involved compensation, benefits and management style of leadership, which lacked the opportunity for the employees to be empowered to effectively perform their duties. Management also addressed these issues with clarification of job responsibilities, compensation/benefit adjustments including stock option incentives and an overall more inclusive and open communication style of management. 
 
Since the Company’s acquisition of RoxSan, the deleterious actions against the pharmacy by the former owner, including, among other things, interference with management and operations, and attempts to damage and/or divert customer and vendor relationships, had a significant adverse impact on the pharmacy. Furthermore, the discovery of the former owner’s alleged involvement in suspected insurance fraud caused RoxSan’s contract with its primary IVF drug rebate program to be terminated in August 2016. As a result, RoxSan was no longer eligible to receive incentive rebates for the majority of its IVF drug purchases, which were key to the profitability of the IVF drug sales; and for which without the rebates, RoxSan was unable to provide its customers with comparably priced IVF drugs. This, among other things, caused a precipitous drop in RoxSan’s IVF revenues, and ultimate exit from the IVF market in mid-2017. Soon thereafter, in July 2017, RoxSan’s contract with its primary drug supplier was terminated for similar reasons connected to the former owner and alleged criminal activities associated with the Melamed family name, despite the Company’s new ownership and management. After careful consideration, the Company determined that RoxSan was unable to generate enough profits to sustain its pharmacy business, and in December 2017, the pharmacy ceased operations.
 
On May 14, 2018, pursuant to a unanimous resolution of the Boards of Directors of RoxSan Pharmacy, Inc. and Parallax Health Sciences, Inc., RoxSan filed a Chapter 7 petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California. Mr. Timothy Yoo was appointed trustee on May 15, 2018. In connection with this filing, RoxSan seeks to discharge approximately $5 million of liabilities owed to various parties including more than $1 million owed to the Company.
 
Market Opportunities 
 
Compounding Industry
 
Pharmaceutical compounding (done in compounding pharmacies) is the creation of a particular pharmaceutical product to fit the unique need of a patient. To do this, compounding pharmacists combine or process appropriate ingredients using a variety of equipment and tools. Compounding may be done for medically necessary reasons, such as to change the form of the medication from a solid pill to a liquid to avoid a non-essential ingredient that the patient is allergic to, or to obtain the exact dose(s) needed or deemed best of particular active pharmaceutical ingredient(s). It may also be done for other reasons, such as adding flavors to a medication or otherwise altering taste or texture. Compounded medications are made based on a practitioner’s prescription in which individual ingredients are mixed together in the exact strength and dosage form required by the patient. This method allows the compounding pharmacist to work with the patient and the prescriber to customize a medication to meet the patient’s specific needs.
 
Compounding is routine in the case of intravenous/parenteral medication, typically by hospital pharmacists, but is also offered by privately owned compounding pharmacies and certain retail pharmacies for various forms of medication. Whether routine or rare, intravenous or oral, etc., when a given drug product is made or modified to have characteristics that are specifically prescribed for an individual patient, it is known as “traditional” compounding.

- 12 -


Compounding has experienced a resurgence as modern technology and innovative techniques and research have allowed more pharmacists to customize medications to meet specific patient needs. Examples of compounded formulations include medications with alternative dosage strengths or unique dosage forms, such as topical creams or gels, suspensions or solutions with more tolerable drug delivery vehicles. Compounded medications can also address patients’ noncompliance with their medication due to offering tastes, routes of administration and dosages that were not otherwise commercially available. Physicians can also work directly with a pharmacist to repurpose or reformulate via the compounding process drugs that have been approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Association (FDA) to meet a patient’s specific medical needs.
 

The primary activities of this industry are: | The major products and services in this industry are:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------
●Preparing alternate dosage forms of medication | ●Currently unavailable pharmaceutical manufacturing 
●Preparing alternate strengths of medication | ●Pharmaceutical application alteration 
●Preparing flavored medication | ●Pharmaceutical dosage alteration 
●Preparing medication for patients with allergies or other sensitivities. | ●Pharmaceutical ingredient alteration 

 
Compounding has proved to be indispensable, despite some negative media attention on compounding pharmacies due to contaminated prescriptions. According to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), about 3.6 billion prescriptions are dispensed in the United States each year. The US Pharmacopeia Convention estimates that 30 million to 40 million of those prescriptions are compounded medications. Over the past five years, numerous trends have increased patient utilization rates of compounded medications. For example, rising healthcare awareness and growth in the number of overall physician visits have bolstered demand for prescriptions and provided a boom to the industry. Moreover, as more patients addressed their allergies to certain drugs and their medication preferences, such as medication that have a different dosage strength, route of administration or flavoring than drugs that were commercially available, demand for compounded medications has increased.
 
Key External Drivers
 
Drug Shortages
 
One of the largest causes of drug shortages are Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs), which secure supplies for healthcare providers, and control about 72.0% of purchases made by hospitals, according to the Healthcare Supply Chain Association. GPOs use their market share as leverage to secure low-cost contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers, resulting in some drug manufacturer to decrease their manufacture and stocking of essential drugs. Compounding pharmacies have benefited from these drug shortages, enabling them to access raw materials and supply medication orders to patients and hospitals. As the number of prescription drug shortages grow, compounding pharmacies are able to help alleviate these shortages by having access to raw materials and downstream markets, such as patients and hospitals. For example, according to the Congressional Research Service’s (CRS) Compounded Drugs report, 62.0% of hospitals outsourced compounded drugs due to drug shortages, 69.0% to ensure drug stability, and 62% to extend drug shelf life. 
 
However, drug shortages have been particularly prominent among sterile injectable generic drugs, which are difficult to compound safely. Some compounding pharmacies, unable to meet FDA standards, have recalled some products. This trend further exacerbated the drug shortage. According to data from the CRS, 48.1% of hospitals reported that a shortage of compounded sterile products would have a significant impact on patient care, whereas 16.6% and 11.5% of hospitals reported that it would result in either an inconvenience or a major disruption to patient care, respectively. 
 
Number of Pets (Cats and Dogs) 
 
In addition to developing drug compounds for humans, compounding pharmacies also create specialized drugs compounded for animals. The number of pet owners is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 2.3% over the five years. Because of this growth, more pet owners will obtain compounded drugs to increase their pet’s compliance with medications, demanding compounded drugs to cater to their pets’ individualized needs such as allergies and complications with the drug’s route of administration.
Number of Physician Visits 
 
Consumers who visit doctors more frequently tend to receive more prescriptions and, in turn, purchase more medications. Therefore, patients may require compounded prescriptions to access drug strengths and forms that are not commercially available. The number of physician visits is expected to increase in 2016. 
Per Capita Disposable Income 
 
Per capita disposable income determines consumers’ ability to purchase this industry’s products. While prescription products can be essential for health and therefore less susceptible to changes in consumer discretionary spending, some of the industry’s offerings, such as medicine flavorings, are subject to changes in disposable income. An increase in disposable income will boost demand for compounding pharmacies. Per capita disposable income is expected to increase in 2016. 
Number of Adults Aged 65 And Older 
 
As the population ages, demand for various pharmaceutical products increases. Adults aged 65 and older are more likely to have chronic illnesses than younger demographics, which stimulates demand for prescriptions. Additionally, elderly individuals may require compounded prescriptions to have personalized dosage forms, flavors or medications that comply with their allergies. The number of adults aged 65 and over is expected to increase in 2016, representing a potential opportunity for the industry. 
Current Industry Performance and Trends [1]

Compounding has historically been very profitable, with high gross margins on product sales. In 2016, there were over 4,100 compounding pharmacies in the US that were estimated to generate over $5.5 billion of revenue and $1.5 billion in profits. The compounding pharmacies market size was over $8 billion in 2016. During the last five years, industry revenue experienced an annualized growth rate of 2.9%, with a growth forecast of over 5% CAGR from 2017 to 2024. 
 
While profit margins are high for the pharmaceutical sector as a whole, industry operators typically have higher margins, which can be attributed to the industry offering a specialized service with no direct substitutes. However, profit margins vary according to industry operators’ product portfolio and clientele. For example, compounding pharmacies that utilize a variety of ingredients and dosage forms for more patient clinical conditions, or have upgraded facilities for compounding medications, typically have higher profit margins. Furthermore, industry operators that develop contracts with physicians, hospitals and medical clinics will have higher profit margins, compared with compounding pharmacies that work directly with patients on an individual basis. In particular, pharmacies that provide prescriptions during a long-term shortage of critical medications will have high profit margins until the pharmaceutical supply is revived. 

- 13 -


During the past five years, the compounding industry has exhibited growth, thanks to an increase in the number of dispensed prescriptions. As the burgeoning elderly population has dealt with a number of chronic illnesses that require medication, demand for compounded pharmaceuticals has risen. For example, patients have used compounded prescriptions to access medications in alternative dosages, routes of administration, ingredients (due to patient allergies) and flavorings than drugs that were commercially available. Moreover, the shortage or termination of prescriptions from drug manufacturers’ product portfolio has stimulated demand for compounded prescriptions.
 
Compounding Pharmacies Market, By Product
 
Oral medications dominated the compounding pharmacies market. The segment is anticipated to follow a similar trend during the forecast timeframe. Preference of individuals to consume medications through the oral route in the form of capsules, tablets and pills will drive segment growth. A growing drug failure rate during the drug discovery process will propel industry expansion. Drug failure leads to decrease in availability of alternate medications to patients resulting in increased dependence of compounded medications.

Fertility Industry
 
The market for IVF drugs in California is the largest in the country and is driven by multiple factors as noted above. In addition to the IVF Market information below, sourced from Harris and Williams and Co. a middle market investment advisory and M & A transaction firm, management at RoxSan and its staff, all the way down to the driver delivering the IVF drugs to its customer, are proud to be part of a business that brings children to people who truly want them and have, until their successful treatment for infertility, been unable to conceive on their own. The IVF group at RoxSan is a major factor in the Company's self-esteem, and it is a symbol of pride for everyone that works at RoxSan and Parallax.
 
Market outlook of the global fertility services market
 
Market research analysts predict the global fertility services market to grow steadily at a CAGR of nearly 9% between 2016 and 2020. The increase in fertility complications is one of the major drivers for the growth of the market. With age, human body starts undergoing various medical and hormonal changes. Likewise, infertility among women is also an age-related issue. Medically, women above the age of 35 are vulnerable to fertility complications. About 20% of women in the age range of 35-44 undergo fertility services to increase their chances of pregnancy, thus boosting the growth of the fertility services market.
 
Along with the increase in fertility issues among women, there has also been an increase in the number of fertility clinics worldwide, which is a trending factor contributing to the growth of the market. The rapid rise in the number of fertility clinics is increasing the accessibility of fertility services across the globe, thus facilitating couples to choose clinics based on their convenience.
 
Segmentation by underlying cause and analysis of the fertility services market
 
Female infertility is a very common problem in about 10% of women in the age range of 15-44 years. As per the NICE guidelines, female infertility is the inability of a woman of reproductive age to conceive after one year of unprotected vaginal intercourse. Ovulation disorders, submucosal fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease, and endometriosis are few of the factors that can cause infertility in women.
 
●
15% of the world's population experiences some sort of difficulties conceiving naturally in their life. 
 ●
In the western society, people are prolonging having their first child more and more, which has a clear negative correlation with chances of conceiving naturally. 
 ●
Furthermore, other western lifestyle diseases such as obesity also have a clear negative correlation with natural conception chances. 
 
Competitive Landscape
 
There are no major players in the industry. No single pharmacy holds more than 5% of the market share, offering an opportunity for consolidation, which management has continued to explore as a potential strategy to compliment and secure growth. Unlike pharmaceutical companies that mass produce medications, compounding pharmacists individually tailor prescriptions to meet specific patient needs, which limits the industry’s ability to benefit from cost synergies from economies of scale.
 
Some of the prominent industry players include Fagron, B.Braun Medical, Fresenius Kabi, Cantrell Drug Company, Institutional Pharmacy Solutions and Pencol Compounding Pharmacy. The industry participants resort to strategies such as acquisitions, collaborations and joint ventures to strengthen their foothold in the compounding pharmacies market. For instance, in 2015 Fagron acquired JCB labs to strengthen its sterile compounding business in North America.
 
Compounding pharmacies are undergoing rapid development through technological advancements and adoption of automation in compounding process. Usage of automation has resulted in increase in quality of preparations through enhanced uniformity. Compounding pharmacies are being equipped with electric mixers, capsule filling machines, ointment mills, electronic mortar and pestle. Usage of electronic balances coupled with software programs has resulted in higher accuracy of formulations. Adoption and implementation of technology will further boost the compounding pharmacies market over the forecast period.
 
Basis of Competition
 
Firms in the Compounding Pharmacies industry face moderate competition, primarily within the industry and stemming only from other regionally located firms. While operators compete on the basis of price, the industry will increasingly generate clientele on the basis of reputation. For example, while the industry is becoming more exposed to regulation, the industry is still experiencing negative media attention from patient deaths and illnesses related to contaminated compounded medications. As a result, industry operators that can generate positive word-of-mouth for compounded medications that are manufactured in sterile environments will likely have a large customer following. Industry operators that develop safe compounded medications that are known for their efficacy will generate high sales volumes. Furthermore, more operators will move toward opting to register with Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board and the US Food and Drug Administration’s current good manufacturing practices to meet standards for quality in the compounding process. 
 
Compounding pharmacies that are prone to regulation will have an advantage over nonregulated industry operators, which will benefit regulated compounding pharmacies in securing favorable contracts with local physicians, hospitals and medical clinics. Additionally, compounding pharmacies will compete to respond to address shortages of manufactured medications for critical conditions or illnesses, which will benefit operators that have the large compounding facilities and access to raw drug ingredients necessary to manufacture drugs during a shortage. Operators also compete to develop networks with physicians and the healthcare sector, which will benefit operators when patients are referred to compounding pharmacies for specialized medications that are compatible with their allergies, medication strength or other customized prescription needs. Moreover, industry operators also compete to develop networks with downstream industries, such as veterinarians, to be referred when a pet owner requires a compounded prescription for their pet. 
 
Barrier to Entry
 
New entrants to the Compounding Pharmacies industry face moderate barriers to entry. The largest barrier to entry for potential industry entrants includes hiring a specialized work force, which is typically comprised of lab technicians and a pharmacist. Employees must be trained in how to handle and manufacture pharmaceutical products, and firms face competition in hiring employees from traditional pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmacies. Additionally, compounding pharmacies that specialize in sterile compounding, such as the preparation of injectable drugs and medication that goes into patients’ body cavities or sterile areas, incur higher costs for purchasing equipment and maintaining a sterile environment to lower the risk for contamination. 

- 15 -

Furthermore, sterile compounding operators also potentially incur costs related to liability issues, which could pose as a potential barrier for potential industry entrants. Many compounding pharmacies have networks with major healthcare systems, which poses as a barrier to entry for small, boutique compounding pharmacies that appeal to local clientele and want to work with healthcare providers. While Accreditation with the Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board, which allows operators to achieve legitimacy via regulated operations, can allow potential industry entrants to secure contracts with hospitals, fewer than 5.0% of compounding pharmacies nationwide achieve accreditation, which could limit a compounding pharmacy from entering the industry. 
 
In addition, compounding pharmacies must invest in facilities, including a sterile laboratory, suitable for manufacturing pharmaceuticals. Finally, compounding pharmacies typically operate solely in small geographic regions and compete against other industry operators within that region. For a new entrant to be successful, it must find a region in which the existing compounding pharmacies are not meeting the demand from a small customer pool. While being monitored by the FDA is not required for industry operators, many will choose to comply with regulations to build legitimacy and attract healthcare providers. According to MediFare consultants, it costs the average compounding pharmacy facility $35,000 to comply with FDA regulations, which is a significant fixed cost for industry entrants. 
 
Government Regulations
 
From October 2011 to September 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected about 150 compounding pharmacies, with 90% of facilities inspected having problems. Historically, pharmaceutical manufacturers contended with high costs from generating brand awareness and complying with FDA regulations, which incited manufacturers to limit their product portfolio. While many compounding pharmacies opted for regulation to achieve credibility for their compounding process, such as accreditation with the Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board to ensure quality and sterility in their compounding facilities, only 163 pharmacies in the United States were accredited in 2013 (latest data available). As a result, some industry operators have exited the industry altogether or have contended with costs related to complying with FDA standards.  As healthcare providers are increasingly purchasing compounded medications from FDA-registered and regulated facilities, many operators will choose to comply with regulations to bolster revenue volumes. Regulation is expected to increase, which represents a potential threat to the industry. 
 
In 2016, the FDA issued proposals to implement statutory restrictions on compounding drugs that are essentially copies of commercially available or approved drugs, and in 2018, is implementing the Compounding Quality Act (FDCA). The new law allows an entity that compounds sterile drugs to register as an outsourcing facility. Once registered, an outsourcing facility must meet certain conditions in order to be exempt from the FDCA’s approval requirements and the requirement to label products with adequate directions for use. Under the new law, the drugs must be compounded in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations by or under the direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist in a registered facility (section 503B(a)). The outsourcing facility must also report specific information about the products that it compounds, including a list of all of the products it compounded during the previous six months, and information about the compounded products, such as the source of the ingredients used to compound (section 503B(3)). In addition, the outsourcing facility must meet other conditions described in the new law, including reporting adverse events and labeling its compounded products with certain information (section 503B(b)(5) and section 503B(a)(10)). Drugs produced by compounders that are not registered as outsourcing facilities must meet the conditions of section 503A to qualify for the exemptions specified in that section. Even if the conditions of section 503A are met, the compounded drugs are only exempt from those provisions of the FDCA. 
 
Principal Suppliers
 
As of December 31, 2016, the principal suppliers of pharmaceutical, fertility and compounding products and ingredients were:
 

●AmerisourceBergen, Valencia, CA | Primary drug supplier, with purchases in excess of $15 million in 2016. 
-------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
●Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Parsippany, NJ | Largest supplier of fertility products with rebates on fertility drugs, with 2016 purchases of over $1.9 million, and rebates reimbursements paid of $1.7 million.
●Parmed Pharmaceuticals, Niagara Falls, NY | Largest wholesale provider of compounding products with over $450,000 in purchases in 2016 

 
The Company relies upon these suppliers to provide the majority of its pharmaceutical, fertility and compounding products. If these suppliers were to cease providing drugs and rebates to RoxSan, the pharmacy’s operations may be adversely affected.
 

PARALLAX HEALTH MANAGEMENT, INC. 
---------------------------------------------------
REMOTE PATIENT CARE - GOOD HEALTH OUTCOMES PLATFORM

Overview
 
Parallax Health Management, Inc. (“PHM”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is part of the Company’s overall healthcare strategy. PHM is a systems integrations operation that provides remote patient monitoring, medication adherence and intelligent tele-medicine delivery systems featuring industry-first capture and data analysis capabilities. 
 
PHM’S primary goal is to deliver good health outcomes for patients through a service that allows healthcare providers of all types to reduce costs, increase revenues and provide a better patient experience and satisfaction. PHM’s Good Health Outcomes platform is promoted through its direct relationships with hospitals and accredited nursing operations, as well as health and wellness service providers, looking to adopt and integrate RPM and telehealth service models within their product and service offerings. 
 
PHM integrates remote monitoring solutions that promote patients’ compliance to therapy, pharmaceutical and treatment regimens prescribed by their physician. Alerts and notifications are used through the platform, and include a series of visual, audible and vibration prompts for patient through email and SMS, and Cloud-based recording for caregivers, for continuous patient monitoring and telehealth delivery capabilities. 
 
PHM’s systems also offer the automation of dispensing packaged medications through a patented process, which can reduce the non-compliance costs and risks for medication, therapy and treatment; and can increase the financial and service delivery success and yields for healthcare providers, ultimately increasing the quality of life for the patient, doctors and care providers, and providing peace of mind for all.
 
Remote Patient Care
 
PHM’s Good Health Outcomes platform features a full set of modern communications technologies specifically targeted for patients that securely ensures data security compliance as well as real-time voice and “video conference” communication directly from any mobile or Internet-connected device. The platform, combined with systems integration services that interface with Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Electronic Medical Records (EMR) technology platforms, enables “virtual doctor visits,” increasing the conveniences for both patients and their doctors and care providers. PHM’s Good Health Outcomes platform and its systems integration positioning, allows for any physician, clinician, nurse, pharmacist, caregiver or family member in a persistently connected real-time system, to support the treatment of the chronically ill, acute and post-acute on a greater scale and with greater precision, outcome and patient satisfaction. 

- 16 -

In a residential environment, RPM benefits are equally important. Seniors and the chronically ill are germane as residents that require less support, less intervention, higher resident-participation rates, increased cognitive capability, overall increased health, a more assured client family environment, longer client stay-times, overall better client health and a more value-added contribution of staff members (and resultant staff satisfaction).The ability to remotely monitor each client, both from the point of view of their medication compliance and from connected sensors, that include everything from vitals monitoring and connected fall detection devices, to quality of sleep devices, enables the residential caregiver to provide a significantly enhanced (and commercially desirable) service for optimal health conditions. With the adoption of a centralized monitoring system, residences will also begin to see a marked reduction in the inter-dependencies that can exist between residents, and an improved state of health- for every resident, further reducing the support load on staff members. 
 
Medication Monitoring/Compliance/Adherence
 
Nonadherence with medication is a complex and multidimensional health care problem. Patients forget to take their medications, creatively alter their medications, engage in unendorsed polypharmacy, mix their medications, and take medications in combinations that may have dire synergistic interaction effects, such as dizziness and confusion. Estimates of medication nonadherence rates typically range from 20% to 85%, (see figure below). As a result, a substantial number of patients do not benefit optimally from pharmacotherapy and can wind up in emergency situations, hospitalized, or worse. In fact, hospital readmission generated by medical non-compliance and non-adherence was a $24 billion-dollar problem in the United States in prior years and is growing. 
 


Medication adherence is a cornerstone of significantly improved quality of life and the Good Health Outcomes platform is the cornerstone of medication adherence. A unique device specifically designed for seniors and the chronically ill, the Good Health Outcomes platform offers enormous potential for patients, their families, their caregivers and for those residences that choose to offer superior services and a superior health environment for their clients. 
 
The Good Health Outcomes platform monitors the adherence of treatment and therapy regimens. In addition, with the advent of an intelligent personal medication device with bio-feedback allows, for the very first time, the quantitative and qualitative feedback of real-time data to pharmacists, physicians and clinicians and, based on the individual patient, enables medication titration to achieve optimal medication therapy. 
 
PHM’s sister Company, Parallax Diagnostics, is in the development stage of acquiring, licensing and developing in-house solutions/products for personalized health monitoring of seniors that will capture a host of vitals. All of these sensor products can be connected to the Good Health Outcomes Hub so that this bio-feedback information is directly correlated with medication consumption information providing clinicians, pharmacists and physicians with real-time, comprehensive data and information on patient condition.
 
Product Strategy 
 
PHM’s product strategy is to eliminate obstructions to consumer adoption of remote patient care systems, so patients can stay out of the hospital longer and have a better quality of care and quality of life.
 
Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems enable efficient healthcare delivery to patients outside conventional hospital or clinical settings, by transmitting real-time patient data for remote clinical review. Correlating vitals with medication history and consumption directly informs health care providers as to the real-time status of a patient, at home or in residence. Anomalies can be reported or alerted to those in need, via the cloud. RPM systems incorporate wireless medical devices and computer-based software applications. The evolution of IoT and IoS technologies is clear and will offer significant business opportunities for patients, residences and the health care system in general. RPM is a cost-effective means of keeping patients out of the hospital and have a better quality of care.
 
Product Benefits

RPM systems, even within the walls of a single building, can offer countless benefits for the overall health management of clients. There are countless tangible benefits to medication adherence as well, including significant reductions in hospitalizations, enhanced quality of life and reductions in the effects of both overmedication and undermedication. Eliminating the distribution and administration of scheduled medications exonerates the residence from the liabilities associated with this task. Human error is all but eliminated. Corporate risks are significantly reduced in this activity and liability insurance premiums may be reduced as well. 

- 17 -

Market Opportunities 
 
The market demand for remote patient care (RPC) solutions is at an all-time high and continues to increase due to healthcare insurance reimbursement of the services delivered over RPC systems. Further, the move from “fee-for-services” to outcomes-based payment structures have brought about the need for doctors and all other healthcare providers to increase the efficiency and to reduce the costs of care delivery to patients. Clearly, as with the introduction of any new technology, there is a significant market differentiator for early adopters. Residences, assisted living facilities and long-term care facilities all exist in a competitive environment in which differentiation between them is based upon higher desirability, which amounts to higher profits for those who are able to offer more. Unlike other service businesses, residences have the ability to attract clients requiring services on a long-term basis. Additional market opportunities exist around hospitals and their management’s needs surrounding the reduction and elimination of patient readmissions. 
 
The global RPM systems market draws immense focus due to strict governmental measures to cut down healthcare expenditure, and reduce hospital stays. Remote Patient Monitoring serves to minimize hospital readmissions, and reduces the load on physician time, and nursing staff, thus greatly reducing healthcare costs. A rapidly aging population vulnerable to chronic diseases, and a growing desire to live independent lives among the elderly are driving growth in the market. Given the rise in the number of insured patients covered under reforms such as the Affordable Care Act, coupled with stricter reimbursement norms, healthcare providers are under constant pressure to manage wider patient population at lower costs. With the healthcare industry migrating towards an outcome-driven effective healthcare system, remote patient monitoring technology stands optimally positioned for growth.
 
Encouraged by the widespread proliferation of high-speed Internet, and related services, adoption of RPM systems is witnessing strong demand. There is growing interest in IoT-driven healthcare services and wearable medical devices that feature sensors, actuators, and other mobile communication methods through which patient data can be continuously transmitted onto a Cloud-based platform. Healthcare providers are increasingly adopting cloud computing technologies, which not only offer cost benefits but also allow healthcare organizations to increase operational efficiency.
 
The global market for remote monitoring systems is projected to reach over $66 billion by 2020, driven by government measures to reduce healthcare spending against a backdrop widening healthcare budget deficit. As stated by the new market research report on Remote Patient Monitoring Devices, North America represents the largest market worldwide, occupying close to 41% of the total market share, and expected to grow at an exponential CAGR of 21.34% during the forecast period. Asia-Pacific ranks as the fastest growing market with a CAGR of 13% over the forecast period. The growth in the region is driven by the increase in per capita healthcare spending and the need for a cost-effective and sustainable healthcare system and infrastructure capable of addressing the growing healthcare needs of an expanding population.
 
The lucrative reimbursement policy introduced by the government agencies promoting the use of telemedicine and virtual health services is driving the market in North America. The US and Canada are the major revenue contributors to the market in North America. Further, the increasing investments in R&D and technological innovations will help major players in the North American region occupy a larger market share over the next few years.
 
Barriers to Entry
 
Key issues challenging smooth growth in the market include high upfront costs of devices, lack of reimbursement and clarity on associated accountability, privacy concerns regarding transmitting sensitive patient data, and security issues of devices.
 
Despite the significant potential benefits to outcomes and patient satisfaction that may accrue through the leveraging of PGHD in clinical care, data ownership remains a barrier to greater use of PGHD in some circumstances. Though the collection and use of patient-generated health data (PGHD) is intuitive to experienced patients, inclusion of such data represents a shift in the way medicine has been practiced. Taking an active role in the collection and management of data about one’s health status increases patient activation, which is strongly related to better health outcomes in multiple conditions. 
 
Patients’ and providers’ use of mobile health (mHealth) apps provide a framework for assessing the role mHealth can play in medicine and as a source of PGHD. Physicians use social media primarily for personal use (60%), though accessing health care news (21%), communicating with peers (18%), marketing the practice (11%), and communicating to patients (4%) are also practiced. Among physicians who choose not to use social media, concerns about patient privacy (52%), lack of time (51%), concerns about liability (42%), the belief that social media has little professional value (40%), and lack of familiarity (23%) are cited most frequently. In 2014, two-thirds of physicians surveyed reported using a mobile app to check medication interactions, diagnose a condition, access EHRs, check results, create clinical notes, and prescribe electronically, and more than a third of US physicians recommended their patients use health apps.

- 18 -

Questions related to provider licensure pose another potential barrier to the routine use of mHealth. When a patient has his or her radiograph read, many current US state laws require that it be read by a physician licensed in the state where the patient is located and had the radiograph. PGHD can raise special issues. For example, if a patient lives in New York and has an mHealth device that continues to monitor certain aspects of his or her health and the patient crosses three states and then travels into the EU, does the patient’s physician need to be licensed in each of the other three states and in the applicable country in the EU when the data is transmitted from that state or country in the EU? Within the United States, most states require that the out-of-state physician receive an unrestricted license in the state in which the initial patient interaction occurred. Some states issue a telemedicine license to facilitate practice across state lines when the physician holds an unrestricted license in another state. In the radiograph situation, the imaging physician is reading the radiograph at one point in time and billing for that service. With the monitoring of an individual’s health information continuously, the clinician may be being paid to manage the patient’s condition or his or her overall care. The special privacy and confidentiality issues can raise important mHealth implications. It is important that vendors and health care systems coordinate their efforts to minimize these issues. 
 
Competitive Landscape
 
Countless smaller companies around the world are innovating in this sector and are now offering everything from Bluetooth connected toothbrushes and bathroom scales (weight loss or gain is a key indicator of health and disease state) to “wearable’s” that capture everything from body Temperature, Pulse Rates, Respiratory Rates and Blood Pressure monitoring to game-changing technologies such as non-invasive blood glucometers that sample blood sugar level several times per second – continuously – without requiring lancets and the drawing of blood samples. 
 
Medical Clinics, on a global scale, are already adopting technologies that allow them to provide better health care to a wider population base. Insurance companies and HMOs also continue to seek the highest quality health care with the highest return on investment by leveraging modern technologies to provide better care to a greater population base at lower cost.
 
There are a large number of companies offering some form of wireless and remote technologies, patient data processing applications and equipment, and electronic medical record data transfer equipment. Competitors supplying advanced patient monitoring and telehealth systems to hospitals are large, established healthcare companies, often working in conjunction with information technology (IT) companies on an entire system. The home healthcare and other sectors are much more fragmented and are dominated by privately held companies. In addition, some companies supply innovative products, but only for a small segment of the market; and some companies supply products on a regional basis only. 
 
There is a world-wide interest in “connected health” with major companies such as Philips, Nokia, Apple, IBM, Microsoft and Google, all investing heavily in sensors and sensor systems for health care, connectivity and RPM. Traditional telcos like AT&T, Verizon and a host of others are also investing heavily in health care systems and in the RPM market.
 
Major players in the global RPM market include Abbott Laboratories, Aerotel Medical Systems, AMD Global Telemedicine, Inc., BIOTRONIK SE & Co. KG, Boston Scientific Corporation, GE Healthcare Ltd., Honeywell Life Care Solutions, Intelesens Ltd., LifeWatch AG, Masimo Corporation, Medtronic Plc, Mindray North America, Nihon Kohden Corporation, Omron Healthcare, Inc., Philips Healthcare, Qualcomm Life, Inc., St. Jude Medical Inc., and Welch Allyn, Incorporated.

Government Regulations
 
The FDA regulates certain medical devices and also certain mobile medical apps. On September 25, 2013, it issued a Final Guidance that defines “mobile medical app,” as a mobile app that (1) meets the definition of a “device” in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and (2) is intended to be used as an accessory to a “regulated medical device’ or to transform a platform into a “regulated medical device.” The Guidance grouped mobile medical apps into three categories: 1) apps that are actively regulated, (e.g., a mobile medical app that monitors the patient’s blood glucose levels and calculates the amount of insulin needed based on the patient’s condition, age, weight, etc.); 2) apps that are subject to enforcement discretion, (e.g., a mobile medical app that provides a patient an alert as to when to take his or her medications); and 3) those that are not considered devices and thus are not regulated (e.g., a mobile medical app that merely provides general health care information available on the Internet, not directed to a specific patient).
 
The FDA guidance addresses data security because patients and other users may experience severe consequences should the device lack adequate data protection or be hacked. The guidance does not address the protection of privacy. Rather, privacy is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), where applicable. When patients’ health information is in the possession of health providers, health plans, business associates, or other covered entities, it is protected under HIPAA; when it is transmitted among individuals or organizations that are not covered entities under HIPAA, it is not protected. Accordingly, health information transmitted via a mobile device by a covered entity is protected under HIPAA privacy and security rules. However, this same information transmitted via a non-covered entity under HIPAA is not protected. HIPAA also does not cover information on an individual’s mobile device.
 
Patient-generated health data (PGHD) is merely data of the patient if a patient checks their blood glucose levels with a mobile device. If, however, he or she uses the device to transmit that information to their clinician for the purpose of monitoring that person’s care and the information becomes part of the patient’s electronic health records (EHRs), the PGHD then falls under HIPAA.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is not hesitant to file complaints against companies that it believes fail to reasonably protect the security of consumers’ personal data, including medical information. In August 2013, FTC filed a complaint against LabMD, Inc., alleging that the medical testing laboratory exposed the personal medical information of more than 9,000 consumers by placing the information on a peer-to-peer file-sharing network. The filing followed the discovery of the personal information of several hundred consumers who used LabMD’s services in the possession of identity thieves. In this case, as in an earlier case against a medical transcription firm that exposed personal medical information on the public Internet, FTC is acting to enforce HIPAA’s security requirements.
 
FTC also regulates misleading claims. If in the sale or distribution of a mobile medical app or device one makes claims about what the device can do, FTC can bring an action to make the individual or entity cease and desist from making such claims. In 2013, FTC published a written guidance and a short video for mobile app developers that offer advice on creating apps that protect users’ privacy and comply with truth-in-advertising principles.
 
Principal Suppliers
 
As of December 31, 2016, the principal suppliers of the medical devices utilized with the Good Health Outcomes platform were:
 

●Amazon Web Services, Seattle, WA | HIPAA-compliant secure server environments for hosting and management of GHOP, REBOOT and Compass.
