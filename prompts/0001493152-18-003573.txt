ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Eco-Stim Energy Solutions, Inc. is a growth-oriented, technology-driven independent oilfield services company providing well stimulation, coiled tubing and field management services to the upstream oil and gas industry. We are focused on reducing the ecological impact and improving the economic performance of the well stimulation process in “unconventional” drilling formations. We currently offer our services to oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”) companies in the United States and Argentina. Our focus is to bring our service offerings, technologies and processes to the most active shale resource basins both domestically and outside of North America using our technology to differentiate our service offerings.
 
For information about our operating segments and financial information by operating segment and geographic area, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Our Services
 
We offer a variety of specialized oilfield services and equipment generally categorized by their typical use during the economic life of a well. A description of the various services we offer is provided below.
Pressure Pumping
 
Our customers utilize our pressure pumping services to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability, which restricts the natural flow of hydrocarbons. The technique of well stimulation consists of pumping a fluid into a cased well at sufficient pressure to create new channels in the rock, which can increase the extraction rates and the ultimate recovery of the hydrocarbons. Our equipment that is contracted by E&P companies to provide pressure-pumping services is referred to as a “well stimulation fleet” or “spread.”
 
We currently operate three well stimulation fleets, two in the United States based out of our operations facility in Fairview, Oklahoma, and one in Argentina based out of our operations facility in Neuquén, Argentina. In the United States, we currently provide pressure pumping services to customers in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma. Our operations base in Fairview, Oklahoma is well situated to provide services to E&P companies in the mid-continent region, including in the Scoop, Stack, Cana-Woodford, Mississippian Lime and Springer plays.
 
Our well stimulation fleets generally include high pressure well-stimulation pumps and other supporting equipment, in both trailer-mounted and skid-mounted configurations. We have the capability of providing a variety of pressure-pumping services, including work-over pumping and well injection. As of March 1, 2018, we (i) owned 47 high-pressure pumps with an aggregate capacity of approximately 110,250 horsepower (“HHP”); (ii) leased six high-pressure pumps with an aggregate capacity of approximately 13,500 HHP; and (iii) owned an additional 20 high-pressure pumps with an aggregate capacity of approximately 45,000 HHP that require refurbishment and upgrade prior to activation for service.
 
A portion of our equipment consists of turbine powered pressure pumping equipment (referred to as “TPUs”), which are powered by remanufactured turbine engines previously used in military applications. Each turbine engine generates approximately 4,000 HHP and therefore when operating at 2,000 HHP, the engine is running at approximately 50% of its capacity, which benefits their reliability and durability. They also weigh less than 10% of the typical reciprocating engine of comparable horsepower. The weight differential allows for better use of space on a trailer and more efficient operations. We believe the TPUs are more cost effective to operate and maintain than conventional diesel-powered equipment when run on natural gas. Prior field operations with our current TPUs have demonstrated compliance with emission standards for nitrogen oxides (“NOx”) and carbon monoxide under the EPA’s Tier 4 standards that regulate emissions from certain off-road diesel engines. Turbine engines also have significantly lower methane leakage compared to reciprocating engines.

Coiled Tubing
 
We currently offer coiled tubing services to customers in Argentina. Our coiled tubing services are used to perform various functions associated with well-servicing operations and to facilitate completion of horizontal wells. Coiled tubing services involve the insertion of steel tubing into a well to convey materials and/or equipment to perform various applications as part of a new completion or the servicing of existing wells, including wellbore maintenance, nitrogen services, thru-tubing services, and formation stimulation using acid and other chemicals. Coiled tubing has become a preferred method of well completion, workover and maintenance projects due to speed, ability to handle heavy-duty jobs across a wide spectrum of pressure environments, safety and ability to perform services without having to shut-in a well. The capabilities of our coiled tubing unit in Argentina cover a wide range of applications for horizontal completion, work-over and well-maintenance projects.
Customers
 
In May 2017, our first U.S. spread commenced operations in Oklahoma for an independent E&P company. In October 2017, our second U.S. spread commenced operations in Oklahoma for another independent E&P company. In November 2017, we negotiated an early release of our first U.S. spread from our contract with our first U.S. customer and have now deployed that spread to serve other customers consisting primarily of independent E&P companies. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our first two U.S. customers accounted for approximately 99% of our total U.S. revenue.

In Argentina, our customers have consisted primarily of international oil and gas E&P companies including national oil companies, local privately-held exploration and production companies and, on occasion, other service companies that have contractual obligations to provide well stimulation and completion services. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our largest customer in Argentina accounted for approximately 44% of our total revenue and 99% of the revenue generated from our operations in Argentina.
 
Customer demand for our services depends primarily upon the capital and operating spending of oil and gas exploration and production companies and the level of drilling activity in the regions we serve. We expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. If one or more of our customers decided not to continue to use our services, our revenue could decline significantly and our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
 
Competition
 
We provide services in the U.S. and Argentina, both highly competitive markets, with competitors comprised of both small and large companies. Our revenues and earnings can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in competition, fluctuations in drilling and completion activity, perceptions of future prices of oil and gas, government regulation, disruptions caused by weather and general economic conditions. We believe the principal competitive factors are price, performance, service quality, safety, response time and breadth of services. We believe our primary competitors in Argentina include Schlumberger, Halliburton, Weatherford, Baker Hughes, Calfrac Well Services and San Antonio International and other oilfield service companies. In the United States, we compete against many of the same competitors as in Argentina but in addition, we also face strong competition from many independent pressure pumping companies. We also compete with various other regional and local providers within each of our geographic markets for products and services.
Markets
 
United States
 
In May 2017, our first U.S. spread commenced operations in Oklahoma. In October 2017, our second U.S. spread commenced operations in Oklahoma. The market in this region is concentrated around wells being drilled in the Scoop, Stack, Cana-Woodford, Mississippian Lime and Springer plays. Activity in this region has accelerated in late 2016 and 2017, and on into the first quarter of 2018. According to Baker Hughes’ North America Rotary Rig Count data, in early March 2018 there were 124 rigs operating in Oklahoma as compared to 98 rigs operating in early March 2017, and 70 rigs operating in early March 2016. We have established a base of operations in Fairview, Oklahoma, which we believe is well situated to provide services to E&P companies in the mid-continent region, including in the Scoop, Stack, Cana-Woodford, Mississippian Lime and Springer plays.
Argentina 
 
We have been operating an oilfield services business in Argentina since December 2014. Our first full year of operations was 2015. The market for our services in Argentina can be broken into three service offerings, (1) pressure pumping, (2) coiled tubing and (3) field management. The majority of our revenue comes from the pressure pumping market which can be broken into three sub-markets, (1) conventional wells, (2) tight gas wells and (3) unconventional wells. Generally, the conventional wells can be serviced with 3-5 pumping units whereas the tight gas wells require 8-10 pumping units. The unconventional wells in Argentina require anywhere from 16 to 24 pumping units. In 2015, we had sufficient pumping capacity to participate in the conventional well market. In 2016, we expanded our capacity and now have the capacity to serve customers in the tight gas market. In the second quarter of 2017, we entered into a two-year contract with the largest operator in Argentina to provide services for their tight gas completions program. We anticipate that as the market in Argentina recovers and activity increases, there may be opportunities to secure other long-term agreements and add additional pumping capacity to service all three markets.
 
Our coiled tubing services support our pressure pumping business, including the drill out of frac plugs, wash-downs, chemical treatments and workover activity. We provide these services to the conventional, tight gas and unconventional well markets in Argentina.

Our field management business consists of various degrees of subsurface analysis derived from the data received from clients or otherwise acquired. The different forms of data include geophysical, geo-mechanical, core samples and other information provided by our customers and data acquired, processed and interpreted by our team including real time fiber optic information data gathered from pressure gauges installed in the wells. This market is driven by exploration and step-out development in new regions or in mature areas where our customers are looking to better understand the production associated with older wells. The market for these services is limited but complements our primary business lines and we believe these services bring expertise and value to our customers.
 
The Baker Hughes rig counts noted drilling rig count in Argentina peaked at 113 in 2014, bottomed at 52 in January 2017 and was 68 in January 2018. The rig count is an indicator of activity in Argentina that we expect will continue to drive the utilization and pricing of our services. Additionally, as wells become more complex and drilling activity moves from traditional to tight gas and then horizontals, we believe demand for pressure pumping services will grow.
 
Potential Liabilities and Insurance
 
Our operations involve a high degree of operational risk and expose us to significant liabilities. An accident involving our services or equipment, or the failure of a product sold by us, could result in personal injury, loss of life, and damage to property, equipment or the environment. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as fire, explosion, or well blowout, may result in substantial claims for damages.
 
We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable for companies of our size and with similar operations. In accordance with industry practice, however, we do not maintain insurance coverage against all the operating risks to which our business is exposed. Therefore, there is a risk our insurance program may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or all losses. Currently, our insurance program includes, among other things, general liability, excess liability, sudden and accidental pollution, contractors’ pollution, equipment floater, commercial property, vehicle, workers’ compensation, directors and officers liability, employment practices liability, and employer’s liability coverage. Our insurance includes various limits and deductibles or retentions, which must be met prior to or in conjunction with recovery.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our business is significantly affected by federal, state, provincial and local laws and other regulations. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things:
 

● | worker safety standards; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the protection of the environment; 
● | the handling and transportation of hazardous materials; 
● | the protection of natural and cultural resources; and 
● | the mobilization of our equipment to, and operations conducted at, our work sites. 

 
Numerous permits are required for the conduct of our business and operation of our various facilities and equipment, including our trucks and other heavy equipment. These permits can be revoked, modified or renewed by issuing authorities based on factors both within and outside our control.
 
We cannot predict changes in the interpretation of, or changes to the policies adopted by governmental agencies in connection with the enforcement of, existing laws and regulations or how such laws, regulations and policies may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings in the future. We also cannot predict whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted, including changes in regulatory oversight, increase of federal, state or local taxes, increase of inspection costs, or the effect such changes may have on us, our businesses or our financial condition.

Environmental Matters
 
Our operations, and those of our customers, are subject to extensive laws, regulations and treaties relating to air and water quality, generation, storage and handling of hazardous materials, and emission and discharge of materials into the environment, and the protection of natural resources. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. Historically, our expenditures in furtherance of our compliance with these laws, regulations and treaties have not been material, and we do not expect the cost of compliance to be material in the future; however, we can provide no guarantee that this will not change.
 
The primary U.S. federal environmental laws to which our operations are subject include the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and regulations thereunder, which regulate air emissions; the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and regulations thereunder, which regulate the discharge of pollutants in industrial wastewater and storm water runoff; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and regulations thereunder, which regulate the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and regulations thereunder, known more commonly as “Superfund,” which imposes liability for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances in the environment. We are also subject to regulation under the U.S. federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations thereunder, which regulate the protection of the safety and health of workers. Analogous state and local laws and regulations may also apply. Similar laws and regulations exist at the national and provincial level in Argentina.
 
In the last several years, there has been domestic and international scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities, resulting in additional regulation. Domestically, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and other federal agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) have finalized rules or made proposals that would subject hydraulic fracturing to further regulation and could restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing. For example, in 2016 the EPA issued final regulations under the CAA establishing performance standards for oil and gas activities, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing and finalized CWA regulations that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. In addition, some states and municipalities have significantly limited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing, or are considering doing so. The BLM and several states have already adopted and more states are considering adopting laws and/or regulations that require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well-construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. The BLM published a final rule in March 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. This BLM rule was challenged in litigation, and, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the March 2015 rule. In January 2018, litigation challenging the BLM’s rescission of the 2015 rule was brought in federal court. If such litigation is successful or if the March 2015 rule is otherwise restored in whole or in part, our hydraulic fracturing activities may be subject to increased regulatory burden. Also in Oklahoma, where we operate in the U.S., the Oklahoma Corporation Commission has taken steps to address the potential link between hydraulic fracturing activities and underground injection disposal well operations and induced seismic events. In Argentina, Neuquén Province has promulgated rules and procedures for the exploration and development of unconventional reservoirs, while other provinces have banned hydraulic fracturing altogether. Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of these proposals, any new federal, state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs for us or our customers, or delays in development or restrictions on our operations or the operations of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
In addition, from time to time regulators in both the U.S. and Argentina have taken steps to restrict emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases based on determinations by the scientific community that such emissions are contributing to climate change. Initiatives to date have generally focused on the development of cap-and-trade and/or carbon tax programs. A cap-and-trade program generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances. Carbon taxes could likewise affect us by being based on emissions from our equipment and could indirectly affect us by increasing operating costs for our customers. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. Severe limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for oil and natural gas, which could decrease demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity.

Raw Materials
 
We purchase various raw materials and component parts in connection with delivering our services. These materials are generally, but not always, available from multiple sources and may be subject to price volatility. While we generally do not experience significant long-term shortages of these materials, we have from time to time experienced temporary shortages of particular raw materials. We are always seeking ways to ensure the availability of resources, as well as manage costs of raw materials.
Cyclical Nature of Our Industry
 
We operate in a highly cyclical industry. The key factor driving demand for our services is the level of drilling activity by E&P companies, which in turn depends largely on the current and anticipated economics of new well completions. Global supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and demand for natural gas are critical in assessing industry outlook. Demand for oil and natural gas is cyclical and subject to large, rapid fluctuations. E&P companies tend to increase capital expenditures in response to increases in oil and natural gas prices, which generally results in greater revenues and profits for oilfield service companies such as ours. Increased capital expenditures also ultimately lead to greater production, which historically has resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices which in turn tend to reduce demand for oilfield services. For these reasons, the results of our operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year.
Seasonality
 
Seasonal weather and severe weather conditions can temporarily impair our operations by reducing our ability to operate for certain time periods, thereby reducing demand for our services.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 230 employees, all of which were full-time employees. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 90% of our Argentine employees and none of our U.S. employees were represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements.
Facilities
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 2930 West Sam Houston Parkway North, Suite 275, Houston, Texas 77043. In addition, we own or lease additional facilities in the various areas in which we operate. For more information about our facilities, please read Part 1 – Item 2 – “Properties.”
Intellectual Property
 
We have registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the following trademarks: Geo-Predict® and Geo-Iteration®. We have not filed any applications for the registration of our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions, but may do so in the future as we deem necessary to protect our business. In addition, we rely to a great extent on the technical expertise and know-how of our personnel to maintain our competitive position.
