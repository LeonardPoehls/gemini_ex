ITEM 1. BUSINESS 


GENERAL

Cleco Holdings’ predecessor was incorporated on October 30, 1998, under the laws of the state of Louisiana. Cleco Holdings is a public utility holding company which holds investments in several subsidiaries, including Cleco Power. Substantially all of its operations are conducted through Cleco Power. Cleco Holdings, subject to certain limited exceptions, is exempt from regulation as a public utility holding company pursuant to provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005.
On April 13, 2016, Cleco Holdings completed its merger with Merger Sub whereby Merger Sub merged with and into Cleco Corporation, with Cleco Corporation surviving the Merger, and Cleco Corporation converting to a limited liability company and changing its name to Cleco Holdings, as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Cleco Group and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Cleco Partners. For more information on the Merger, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 3 — Business Combinations.” 
Cleco Power’s predecessor was incorporated on January 2, 1935, under the laws of the state of Louisiana. Cleco Power was organized on December 12, 2000. Cleco Power is an electric utility engaged principally in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity within Louisiana. In December 2013, Cleco Power integrated its generation dispatch and transmission operations with MISO. Cleco Power is regulated by the LPSC and FERC, along with other governmental authorities. The rates Cleco Power can charge its retail customers are determined by the LPSC, and its transmission tariffs are regulated by FERC. The rates Cleco Power charges its wholesale customers are subject to FERC’s triennial market power analysis. Cleco Power serves approximately 288,000 customers in Louisiana through its retail business and supplies wholesale power in Louisiana and Mississippi. Cleco Power’s operations are described below. For more information on MISO, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Regulatory and Other Matters — Transmission Rates of Cleco Power.”
Midstream, which was organized on September 1, 1998, under the laws of the state of Louisiana, is a merchant energy subsidiary that prior to March 15, 2014, owned and operated a merchant power plant (Coughlin). Prior to April 29, 2011, Midstream also owned an indirect interest in a merchant power plant (Acadia).

Certain Factors Affecting Cleco Power
As an electric utility, Cleco Power is affected, to varying degrees, by a number of factors influencing the electric utility industry in general. For more information on these factors, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016, and 2015 — Cleco Power — Significant Factors Affecting Cleco Power.”
Power Generation
As of December 31, 2016, Cleco Power’s aggregate net electric generating capacity was 3,168 MW. This amount reflects the maximum production capacity these units can sustain over a specified period of time. In September 2016, Teche Unit 1, a 23-MW natural gas generating unit, was retired. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to Cleco Power’s generating facilities:



GENERATING STATION | YEAR OF INITIAL OPERATION | | NAMEPLATE CAPACITY (MW) | (1) | NET CAPACITY (MW) | (2) | PRIMARY FUEL USED FOR GENERATION | GENERATION TYPE
Brame Energy Center | | | | | 
Nesbitt Unit 1 | 1975 | | 440 | | 421 | | natural gas | steam

(1) Nameplate capacity is the capacity at the start of commercial operations.
(2) Based on capacity testing of the generating units and operational tests performed during May, June, July, and August 2016. These amounts do not represent generating unit capacity for MISO planning reserve margins.
(3) Represents Cleco Power’s 30% ownership interest in the capacity of Rodemacher Unit 2, a 523-MW generating unit.
(4) Represents Cleco Power’s 50% ownership interest in the capacity of Dolet Hills, a 650-MW generating unit.

The following table sets forth the amounts of power generated by Cleco Power for the years indicated:

YEAR | THOUSANDMWh | PERCENT OFTOTAL ENERGYREQUIREMENTS
2016 | 12,759 | 103.6 
2015 | 12,564 | 100.2 
2014 | 9,858 | 74.9 
2013 | 9,736 | 83.8 
2012 | 9,143 | 81.3 


In December 2013, Cleco Power integrated its generation dispatch and transmission operations with MISO. The amount of power generated by Cleco Power is dictated by the availability of Cleco Power’s generating fleet and the manner in which MISO dispatches each generating unit. Depending on how generating units are dispatched by MISO, the amount of power generated may be greater than or less than total energy requirements. Generating units are dispatched by referencing 


each unit’s economic efficiency as it relates to the overall MISO market. For more information on MISO, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Regulatory and Other Matters — Transmission Rates of Cleco Power.”
Fuel and Purchased Power 
Changes in fuel expenses reflect fluctuations in the amount, type, and pricing of fuel used for electric generation; fuel transportation and delivery costs; and deferral of expenses for recovery from customers through the FAC in subsequent months. Changes in purchased power expenses are a result of the quantity and price of economic power purchased from the MISO market. These quantity changes can be affected by Cleco plant outages and plant performance. For a discussion of certain risks associated with changes in fuel costs and their impact on utility customers, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors — LPSC Audits” and “— Transmission Constraints.”

Power Purchases
In December 2013, Cleco Power integrated its generation dispatch and transmission operations with MISO. Consequently, MISO now makes economic and routine dispatch decisions regarding Cleco Power’s generating units. Since joining MISO, power purchases have been made at prevailing market prices, also referred to as LMP, which are highly correlated to natural gas prices. LMP includes a component directly related to congestion on the transmission system. Pricing zones with greater transmission congestion will have a higher LMP. Physical transmission constraints present in the MISO market could increase energy costs within Cleco Power’s pricing zone. For information on Cleco Power’s ability to pass on to its customers substantially all of its fuel and purchased power expenses, see “— Regulatory Matters, Industry Developments, and Franchises — Rates.”
Coal, Petroleum Coke, and Lignite Supply
Cleco Power uses coal for generation at Rodemacher Unit 2.  During 2016, Cleco Power contracted with Peabody Coal Sales LLC and Arch Coal Sales to provide Cleco Power’s coal needs at Rodemacher Unit 2. A portion of Rodemacher Unit 2’s coal supply was provided from two Peabody Coal Sales LLC agreements that expired in December 2016, and the remaining supply was provided from an Arch Coal Sales agreement that expires in June 2017. The coal supply agreements were fixed-price contracts. The remainder of Cleco Power’s coal needs for 2017 will be met with spot purchases. With respect to transportation of coal, Cleco Power’s agreement with Union Pacific Railroad Company for transportation of coal from Wyoming’s Powder River Basin to Rodemacher Unit 2 expired on December 31, 2016. A new transportation agreement with Union Pacific Railroad began on January 1, 2017, for a term of 3 years. Cleco Power leases 231 railcars to transport its coal under two long-term leases, one expiring in March 2017, under which management is evaluating future options, and the other expiring in March 2021.
The continuous supply of coal may be subject to interruption due to adverse weather conditions or other factors that may disrupt transportation to the plant site. At December 31, 2016, Cleco Power’s coal inventory at Rodemacher Unit 2 was approximately 76,000 tons (approximately a 32-day supply).
Cleco Power uses a combination of petroleum coke and Illinois Basin coal for generation at Madison Unit 3. Petroleum coke is a by-product of the oil refinery process and is not considered a fuel specifically produced for a market; however, ample petroleum coke supplies are produced from refineries each year throughout the world, particularly in the Gulf Coast region. During 2016, Cleco received its petroleum coke supply 


from refineries located along the lower Mississippi River with some spot cargo purchases being delivered from upper Mississippi refineries. Cleco purchased slightly more than one million tons of petroleum coke during 2016, all of which were either an evergreen extension of a previous agreement or a newly negotiated agreement for one year ending December 31, 2016. All existing contracts have been extended and newly negotiated contracts have been completed for petroleum coke supply in 2017. Petroleum coke spot purchases are typically short-term in nature, ranging from one- to six-month terms. Each of the agreements is either a fixed price spot purchase or priced per the Jacobs Consultancy Petroleum Coke Quarterly Monthly Price Index or the “PACE” Monthly Index.  
During 2016, Cleco purchased approximately 268,000 tons of Illinois Basin coal. Cleco Power uses Louisiana waterways, such as the Mississippi River and the Red River, to deliver both petroleum coke and Illinois Basin coal to the plant site. The continuous supply of petroleum coke and Illinois Basin coal may be subject to interruption due to adverse weather conditions or other factors that may disrupt transportation to the plant site. Savage Services is Cleco Power’s exclusive transportation coordinator and provider. The amended and restated logistics agreement dated December 28, 2012, with Savage Services continues through August 31, 2017. The term of this agreement will automatically renew for successive periods of two years each unless written notice is provided by either party at least four months prior to the expiration of the term in effect. The amended agreement contains a provision for early termination with a three-month prior written notice upon the occurrence of specified cancellation events. Cleco is evaluating future options related to its fuel transportation agreement with Savage Services. At December 31, 2016, Cleco Power’s petroleum coke inventory at Madison Unit 3 was approximately 257,000 tons and Cleco Power’s Illinois Basin coal inventory at Madison Unit 3 was approximately 95,000 tons. The total fuel inventory was 352,000 tons (approximately a 70-day supply).
Cleco Power uses lignite for generation at the Dolet Hills Power Station. Cleco Power and SWEPCO each own an undivided 50% interest in the other’s leased and owned lignite reserves within the Dolet Hills mine in northwestern Louisiana. Additionally, through Oxbow, which is owned 50% by Cleco Power and 50% by SWEPCO, Cleco Power and SWEPCO control 74 million tons of estimated recoverable lignite reserves also located in northwestern Louisiana. Cleco Power and SWEPCO have entered into a long-term agreement with DHLC for the mining and delivery of lignite reserves at both mines, the operations of which are conducted by SWEPCO. The Amended Lignite Mining Agreement requires Cleco Power and SWEPCO to purchase the lignite mined and delivered by DHLC at cost plus a specified management fee. The term of

CLECO POWER | 2016 FORM 10-K

this contract runs until all economically mineable lignite has been mined. The reserves from these mines are expected to be sufficient to fuel the Dolet Hills Power Station until at least 2036. At December 31, 2016, Cleco Power’s investment in Oxbow was $18.7 million. For information regarding deferred mining costs and obligations associated with this mining agreement see, Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 4 — Regulatory Assets and Liabilities — Mining Costs,” Note 15 — “Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees — Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Guarantees,” and “— Long-Term Purchase Obligations.” For more information on Oxbow, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 13 — Variable Interest Entities.”
The continuous supply of lignite may be subject to interruption due to adverse weather conditions or other factors that may disrupt mining operations or transportation to the plant site. At December 31, 2016, Cleco Power’s lignite inventory at Dolet Hills was approximately 251,000 tons (approximately a 40-day supply). 
Natural Gas Supply
During 2016, Cleco Power purchased 30.3 million MMBtu of natural gas for the generation of electricity. The annual and average per-day quantities of gas purchased by Cleco Power from each supplier are shown in the following table:

NATURAL GAS SUPPLIER | 2016PURCHASES(MMBtu) | AVERAGE AMOUNTPURCHASED PER DAY (MMBtu) | PERCENT OFTOTAL NATURALGAS USED |

Cleco Power owns natural gas pipelines and interconnections at all of its generating facilities which allow it to access various natural gas supply markets and maintain a more economical fuel supply for Cleco Power’s customers.
Natural gas was available without interruption throughout 2016. Cleco Power expects to continue to meet its natural gas requirements with purchases on the spot market through daily, monthly, and seasonal contracts with various natural gas suppliers. However, future supplies to Cleco Power remain vulnerable to disruptions due to weather events and transportation issues. Large industrial users of natural gas, including electric utilities, generally have low priority among gas users in the event pipeline suppliers are forced to curtail deliveries due to inadequate supplies. As a result, prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply interruptions. During 2016, in order to partially address potential natural gas fuel curtailments and interruptions, Cleco contracted for natural gas firm transportation with several interstate pipelines for a period of one year ending in late 2017. In order to supply gas to Cleco Power’s generating facilities in the event of an 


interruption of supply due to events of force majeure and to operationally balance gas supply to the units, gas storage will continue to be used. The storage volume is contracted by paying a capacity reservation charge at a fixed rate. There are also variable charges incurred to withdraw and inject gas from storage. At December 31, 2016, Cleco Power had 1.7 million MMBtu of gas in storage. Currently, Cleco Power anticipates that its diverse supply options, gas storage, and alternative fuel capability, combined with its solid-fuel generation resources, are adequate to meet its generation needs during any temporary interruption of natural gas supplies.
Sales
Cleco Power’s 2016 and 2015 system peak demands, which occurred on August 2, 2016, and August 10, 2015, were 2,490 MW and 2,700 MW, respectively. Sales and system peak demand are affected by weather and are typically highest during the summer air-conditioning season; however, peaks may occur during the winter season as well. In 2016, Cleco Power experienced warmer than normal summer weather conditions and warmer than normal winter weather conditions. In 2015, Cleco Power experienced warmer than normal summer weather conditions and warmer than normal winter weather conditions. For information on the effects of future energy sales on Cleco Power’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors — Future Electricity Sales” and “— Weather Sensitivity.” For information on the financial effects of seasonal demand on Cleco Power’s quarterly operating results, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 20 — Miscellaneous Financial Information (Unaudited).”
Reserve margin is the net capacity resources (either owned or purchased) less native load demand, divided by native load demand. Members of MISO submit their forecasted native load demand to MISO each year. During 2016, Cleco Power’s reserve margin was 23.8%, which was above MISO’s unforced planning reserve margin benchmark of 7.6.%. During 2015, Cleco Power’s reserve margin was 21.3%, which was above MISO’s unforced planning reserve margin benchmark of 7.1%. Cleco Power expects to meet or exceed MISO’s unforced planning reserve margin benchmark of 7.8% in 2017.

REGULATORY MATTERS, INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS, AND FRANCHISES

Rates
Cleco Power’s electric operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the LPSC with respect to retail rates, standards of service, accounting, and other matters. Also, Cleco Power is subject to the jurisdiction of FERC with respect to transmission tariffs, accounting, interconnections with other utilities, reliability, and the transmission of power. Periodically, Cleco Power has sought and received from both the LPSC and FERC increases in retail rates and transmission tariffs, respectively, to cover increases in operating costs and costs associated with additions to generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. The rates Cleco Power charges its wholesale customers are subject to FERC’s triennial market power analysis.
Cleco Power’s annual retail earnings are subject to the terms of an FRP established by the LPSC. Prior to July 1, 2014, Cleco Power’s FRP allowed a target ROE of 10.7%, while providing the opportunity to earn up to 11.3%. Additionally, 60.0% of retail earnings between 11.3% and 12.3% and all retail earnings over 12.3% were required to be refunded to customers. In April 2013, Cleco Power filed an application with the LPSC to extend its current FRP and to seek rate recovery of the Coughlin transfer. In June 2014, the LPSC approved Cleco Power’s FRP extension, finalized the rate treatment of Coughlin, and issued the implementing order. Effective July 1, 2014, under the terms of the FRP extension, Cleco Power’s retail rates were adjusted based on a target ROE of 10.0%, while providing the opportunity to earn up to 10.9%. Additionally, 60% of retail earnings between 10.9% and 11.75% and all retail earnings over 11.75% are required to be refunded to customers. The amount of credits due to customers, if any, is determined by Cleco Power and the LPSC annually. Credits are typically included on customers’ bills the following summer, but the amount and timing of the refunds is ultimately subject to LPSC approval. The capital structure assumes an equity ratio of 51%. The FRP extension includes a mechanism that allows for recovery in base rates, the revenue requirements related to excess amounts of surcredits refunded for storm costs and uncertain tax positions, MISO transition and administration charges, Louisiana state corporate franchise taxes, incremental production operations and maintenance costs, LPSC renewable project costs, and certain capacity costs. It also includes recovery of deferred costs for the previous LPSC fuel audit, biomass pilot project costs, and costs related to filing the FRP extension. The FRP extension also includes a mechanism allowing for recovery of incremental capacity costs above the level included in base rates and allows Cleco Power to request recovery of additional capital project costs during its four-year term. Cleco Power was scheduled to file an application with the LPSC for a new FRP by June 30, 2017. However, as part of the merger approval process, Cleco Power agreed not to file an application for a new FRP or request an increase in base rates 


until June 30, 2019, with anticipated new rates being effective on July 1, 2020.
Generally, the cost of fuel used for electric generation and the cost of power purchased for utility customers are recovered through the LPSC-established FAC, that enables Cleco Power to pass on to its customers substantially all such charges. Recovery of FAC costs is subject to periodic fuel audits by the LPSC. The LPSC FAC General Order issued in November 1997, in Docket No. U-21497 provides that an audit will be performed at least every other year. On February 3, 2016, the LPSC initiated an audit of Cleco Power’s fuel and purchased power expenses for the period January 2014 through December 2015. The total amount of fuel expense included in this audit was $582.6 million. On January 19, 2017, the LPSC Staff issued its audit report which recommended no disallowance of fuel costs. Management expects the report to be approved by the LPSC in the second quarter of 2017. Cleco Power currently has FAC filings for 2016 subject to audit. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the disallowance, if any, related to these filings.
In July 2009, the LPSC issued Docket No. U-29380 Subdocket A, which provides for an EAC to recover from customers certain costs of environmental compliance. The costs eligible for recovery are prudently incurred air emissions credits associated with complying with federal, state, and local air emission regulations that apply to the generation of electricity reduced by the sale of such allowances. Also eligible for recovery are variable emission mitigation costs, which are the costs of reagents such as ammonia and limestone that are a part of the fuel mix used to reduce air emissions, among other things. Cleco Power began incurring additional environmental compliance expenses in the second quarter of 2015 for reagents associated with compliance with MATS. These expenses are eligible for recovery through Cleco Power’s EAC and are subject to periodic review by the LPSC. For more information on MATS, see “Environmental Matters — Air Quality.” 
On February 3, 2016, the LPSC initiated an audit of Cleco Power’s environmental costs for the period November 2010 through December 2015. The total amount of environmental costs included in this audit was $81.2 million. On December 1, 2016, the LPSC Staff issued its audit report which recommended a disallowance of environmental costs of less than $0.1 million. The report was approved by the LPSC on February 17, 2017. Cleco Power currently has EAC filings for 2016 subject to audit. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the disallowance, if any, related to these filings.
On April 8, 2016, the LPSC issued Docket No. R-34026 to investigate double leveraging issues for all LPSC-jurisdictional utilities whereby double leveraging is utilized to fund a utility’s capital structure, and to consider whether any costs associated with such double leveraging should be included in the rates paid by the utility’s retail customers. Cleco Power filed a motion to intervene in this proceeding along with other Louisiana utilities. On April 8, 2016, the LPSC also issued Docket No. R-34029 to investigate tax structure issues for all LPSC-jurisdictional utilities to consider whether only the state and federal taxes included in a utility’s retail rate will be those that do not exceed the utility’s share of the actual taxes paid to those federal and state taxing authorities. Cleco Power filed a motion to intervene in this proceeding along with other Louisiana utilities. On October 4, 2016, Cleco received the first

set of data requests from the LPSC Staff for each of the above mentioned dockets. Cleco has filed responses to the non-confidential requests and is waiting on the completion of a confidentiality agreement to respond to the confidential requests. Cleco anticipates the completion of this agreement in the second quarter of 2017. If the LPSC were to disallow such costs incurred by the utility to be included in retail rates, such disallowance could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.

Legislative and Regulatory Changes and Matters
Various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies are considering a number of issues that could shape the future of the electric utility industry. Such issues include, among others:

• | the ability of electric utilities to recover stranded costs,


• | the role of electric utilities, independent power producers, and competitive bidding in the purchase, construction, and operation of new generating capacity,


• | the pricing of transmission service on an electric utility’s transmission system, or the cost of transmission services provided by an RTO/ISO,


• | FERC’s assessment of market power and a utility’s ability to buy generation assets,


• | mandatory transmission reliability standards,


• | FERC rulemakings encouraging migration of utility operations to RTOs,


• | NERC’s imposition of additional reliability and cybersecurity standards,


• | the authority of FERC to grant utilities the power of eminent domain,


• | increasing requirements for renewable energy sources,


• | demand response and energy efficiency standards,


• | comprehensive multi-emissions environmental regulation in the areas of air, water, and waste,


• | regulation of greenhouse gas emissions,


• | regulation of the disposal and management of CCRs from coal-fired power plants,


• | FERC’s increased ability to impose financial penalties, and


• | the Dodd-Frank Act.

Management is unable, at this time, to predict the outcome of such issues or the effects thereof on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Environmental Quality
Cleco is subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines and penalties. Cleco has obtained the environmental permits necessary for its operations, and management believes Cleco is in compliance in all material respects with these permits, as well as all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Environmental requirements affecting electric power generating facilities are complex, change frequently, and have become more stringent over time as a result of new legislation, administrative actions, and judicial interpretations. Therefore, the capital costs and other expenditures necessary to comply with existing and new environmental requirements are difficult to determine. Cleco Power may request recovery of the costs to comply with certain environmental laws and regulations from its retail customers. If revenue relief were to be approved by the LPSC, 


12


CLECO | 
CLECO POWER | 2016 FORM 10-K

then Cleco Power’s retail rates could increase. If the LPSC were to deny Cleco Power’s request to recover all or part of its environmental compliance costs, then Cleco Power would bear those costs directly. Such a decision could negatively impact, perhaps significantly, the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. Cleco Power’s capital expenditures, including AFUDC, related to environmental compliance were $6.4 million during 2016 and are estimated to be $4.5 million in 2017.
Air Quality
Air emissions from each of Cleco’s generating units are strictly regulated by the EPA and the LDEQ. The LDEQ has authority over and implements certain air quality programs established by the EPA under the federal CAA, as well as its own air quality regulations. The LDEQ establishes standards of performance and requires permits for EGUs in Louisiana. All of Cleco’s generating units are subject to these requirements.
The EPA has proposed and adopted rules under the authority of the CAA relevant to the emissions of SO2 and NOx from Cleco’s generating units. The CAA contains a regional haze program with the goal of returning certain areas of the nation to natural visibility by 2064. States are required to develop regional haze State Implementation Plans (SIP) and revise them every ten years. SIP must include several components, including requirements for the installation of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) for eligible EGUs in Louisiana. The LDEQ now must determine what the BART requirements will be for BART-eligible EGUs for the control of SO2 and NOx. Until the LDEQ determines what BART requirements are for Cleco units and completes its update of SIP, Cleco is unable to predict if the adopted rules will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. The CAA also established the Acid Rain Program to address the effects of acid rain and imposed restrictions on acid rain-causing SO2 emissions from certain generating units. The CAA requires these EGUs to possess a regulatory “allowance” for each ton of SO2 emitted beginning in the year 2000. The EPA allocates a set number of allowances to each affected unit based on its historic emissions. As of December 31, 2016, Cleco had sufficient allowances for operations in 2016 and expects to have sufficient allowances for 2017 operations under the Acid Rain Program.
The Acid Rain Program also established emission rate limits on NOx emissions for certain generating units. Cleco Power is able to achieve compliance with the acid rain permit limits for NOx at all of its affected facilities. 
In July 2011, the EPA finalized a rule titled “Federal Implementation Plans to Reduce Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone” known as CSAPR that would require significant reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from EGUs in 28 states, including Louisiana. Under CSAPR, the EPA set total emissions limits for each state, allowing limited interstate trading (and unlimited intrastate trading) of emission allowances among power plants to comply with these limits beginning May 1, 2012. Specifically for Louisiana, CSAPR limited NOx emissions for the ozone season, which consisted of the months of May through September. After several years of litigation over the rule, in October 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the EPA’s request that the court lift the stay on CSAPR. On January 1, 2015, the EPA implemented CSAPR on an interim basis. In May 2015, Cleco began complying with 


the rule’s requirements for limiting NOx emissions during annual ozone seasons. 
In December 2015, the EPA published the proposed CSAPR update for the 2008 ozone NAAQS in the Federal Register. The EPA finalized the rule on October 26, 2016, with publication in the Federal Register. The EPA proposed Federal Implementation Plans (FIP) that update the existing EGU CSAPR NOx ozone season emission budgets and implement the budgets through the existing CSAPR NOx ozone-season allowance trading program. The FIP requires implementation beginning with the 2017 ozone season. Management does not believe the final rule will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
In February 2012, the EPA finalized the MATS ruling that requires affected EGUs to meet strict emission limits on new and existing coal- and liquid oil-fired EGUs for mercury, acid gases, and non-mercury metallic pollutants. Cleco Power units impacted by the rule included Rodemacher Unit 2, Madison Unit 3, and Dolet Hills. MATS controls equipment was installed and Cleco Power’s three EGUs affected by the MATS rule were compliant by the April 16, 2015, deadline. In February 2016, the LPSC approved Cleco Power’s request for authorization to recover the revenue requirements associated with the MATS equipment. As of December 31, 2016, Cleco Power had spent $106.2 million on the project. Cleco Power’s final project cost is expected to be $108.0 million, with the remaining costs being related to post-construction refinements. On March 31, 2016, the Sierra Club filed a petition for judicial review in the 19th Judicial District Court, State of Louisiana, requesting that the LPSC’s approval of MATS be vacated. Deadlines have not been set by the 19th Judicial District Court. Cleco believes the LPSC’s approval was neither arbitrary nor capricious and, as such, believes the Sierra Club’s request to be without merit. In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded the MATS rule to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court held that the EPA had not demonstrated that the promulgation of the MATS rule was “appropriate and necessary” due to the EPA’s failure to consider costs. In December 2015, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the rule to the EPA; however, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals did not vacate the rule. On April 15, 2016, the EPA released a final supplemental finding that, even considering costs, it is appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutants. By the June 24, 2016, deadline, six petitions were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals for review of the EPA’s findings. 
Greenhouse gases (GHG) and their role in climate change have been the focus of extensive study and legal action. Fossil fuel-fired EGUs emit a significant amount of GHG in the combustion process. Congress has attempted to craft specific legislation that would reduce emissions of GHG by utilities, industrial facilities, and other manufacturing sectors of the economy. While congressional attempts have not been successful, it is possible that federal GHG legislation may be enacted within the next several years. 
In the absence of federal legislation, the EPA adopted a series of rules under the CAA that, taken together, regulate GHG emissions from both mobile and stationary sources. As a result, since July 2011, new major stationary sources of GHG emissions and major modifications of existing stationary sources have been required to obtain a permit for their GHG emissions. In its May 2010, Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V GHG “Tailoring Rule,” the EPA 


13


CLECO | 
CLECO POWER | 2016 FORM 10-K

set the threshold for new major sources and major modifications of existing sources of GHG emissions and CO2 equivalents at 100,000 tons per year and 75,000 tons per year, respectively. The U.S. Supreme Court partially invalidated the Tailoring Rule in June 2014, holding that the EPA does not have the authority to regulate GHG emissions from all sources, but only from sources that would otherwise be subject to PSD permitting based on exceeding the emissions limits for other pollutants. Cleco does not anticipate a modification at any of its existing sources that would trigger PSD and an associated Best Available Control Technology demonstration for GHG.
In August 2015, the EPA released the final guidelines referred to as the CPP. These guidelines provide each state with standards for CO2 emissions from the state’s utility industry. The EPA derived the limits for each state through a strategy involving a combination of unit efficiency improvements, dispatching away from boilers to combined cycle units, and applying renewable energy. The CPP requires significant reductions of CO2 emissions. The CPP sets interim and final CO2 emission goals for each state. The interim emission goals begin in 2022, with final emission goals required by 2030. The rule is currently under review by electric utilities and state regulators. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the CPP, which will stay in place until the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rules on the merits, followed by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. Oral arguments were heard by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on September 27, 2016, with a final decision expected by mid-year 2017. If the U.S. Supreme Court grants a writ application, a decision is not expected until early 2018. Until the U.S. Supreme Court issues a ruling and the State of Louisiana releases an implementation plan, management cannot predict what the final standards will entail for Cleco or what controls the EPA and the state of Louisiana may require in a final state implementation plan. However, any new rules that require significant reductions of CO2 emissions could require significant capital expenditures or curtailment of operations of certain EGUs to achieve compliance.
In August 2015, the EPA released the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) rules for CO2 emissions from new, modified, or reconstructed units. The rules set requirements and conditions with respect to CO2 emission standards for new units and those that are modified or reconstructed. Cleco does not anticipate a modification or reconstruction of its existing sources that would trigger the application of the proposed CO2 emission limits.
The enactment of federal or state renewable portfolio standards (RPS) mandating the use of renewable and alternative fuel sources such as wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal could result in certain changes in Cleco’s business or its competitive position. These changes could include additional costs for renewable energy credits, alternate compliance payments, or capital expenditures for renewable generation resources. RPS legislation has been enacted in many states and Congress is considering various bills that would create a national RPS. Cleco continues to evaluate the impacts of potential RPS legislation on its business based on the RPS programs in other states.
As part of its periodic re-evaluation of the protectiveness of the NAAQS, the EPA has adopted rules that strengthen the NAAQS for specific criteria pollutants including ozone, NO2, and SO2. In 2008, the EPA issued a NAAQS for ozone of 75 ppb. The EPA designated the five-parish area around Baton Rouge as a non-attainment area for ozone under the 2008 


NAAQS, which required that Louisiana establish a state implementation plan to bring those areas back into attainment by 2015. The state plan for implementing the 2008 NAAQS did not impact Cleco’s generating units.
In October 2015, the EPA released a final rule to strengthen the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard by decreasing the current value of 75 ppb to a value of 70 ppb. However, since the state of Louisiana has not released an implementation plan, Cleco cannot predict what the compliance requirements may be or if the new rule will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
A revised primary NAAQS for NO2 promulgated by the EPA took effect in April 2010. The EPA established a new one-hour standard at a level of 100 ppb to supplement the existing annual standard. In January 2012, the EPA determined that no area in the country was violating the standard. However, the LDEQ expects to operate new monitors at two portions of highways in the Baton Rouge and New Orleans areas. The EPA may redesignate areas based on new data it receives from states. Due to the fact that fossil fuel-fired EGUs are a significant source of NO2 emissions in the country, a non-attainment designation could result in utilities such as Cleco being required to substantially reduce its NO2 emissions. However, because the EPA has not yet completed any new designations, Cleco cannot predict the likelihood or potential impacts of such a rule on its generating units at this time.
The EPA revised the NAAQS for SO2 in June 2010. The new standard is now a one-hour health standard of 75 ppb, designed to reduce short-term exposures to SO2 ranging from five minutes to 24 hours. An important aspect of the new SO2 standard is a revised emission monitoring network combined with a new ambient air modeling approach to determine compliance with the new standard. The EPA designated St. Bernard Parish as a non-attainment area. The EPA expects to use monitoring or modeling data developed in the future to confirm the status of areas that currently have no monitoring data. Classification of those areas currently without adequate data will be deferred until adequate data has been developed. In November 2015, the LDEQ notified the EPA that DeSoto Parish was in compliance with the NAAQS SO2 requirement and recommended a designation of attainment. In February 2016, the EPA responded indicating that it intends to classify a portion of DeSoto Parish as non-attainment. The EPA accepted information and comments from the LDEQ. The public was also provided an opportunity to submit comments. Cleco provided comments to the EPA on March 30, 2016. The EPA’s final designation published in the Federal Register on July 12, 2016, designated DeSoto Parish to be nonclassifiable/attainment. As a result, there is no impact to Cleco’s generating units.
In the past, Cleco Power received notices from the EPA requesting information relating to the Brame Energy Center and the Dolet Hills Power Station. The purpose of the data requests was to determine whether Cleco Power complied with the New Source Review permitting program and NSPS requirements under the CAA in connection with capital expenditures, modifications, or operational changes made at these facilities. Cleco Power has completed its responses to the initial data requests. Cleco Power is unable to predict whether the EPA will take further action as a result of the information provided.

Water Quality
Cleco’s facilities also are subject to federal and state laws and regulations regarding wastewater discharges. Cleco has received from the EPA and the LDEQ permits required under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) for wastewater discharges from its generating stations. Wastewater discharge permits have fixed dates of expiration and Cleco applies for renewal of these permits within the applicable time periods.
In March 2011, the EPA proposed regulations which would establish standards for cooling water intake structures at existing power plants and other facilities pursuant to Section 316(b) of the CWA. The EPA published its final rule in August 2014. The standards are intended to protect fish and other aquatic wildlife by minimizing capture both in screens attached to intake structures (impingement mortality), and in the actual intake structures themselves (entrainment mortality). The proposed standards would (1) set a performance standard, dealing with fish impingement mortality, or reduce the flow velocity at cooling water intakes to less than 0.5 feet per second, and (2) require entrainment standards to be determined on a case-by-case basis by state-delegated permitting authorities. Facilities subject to the proposed standards are required to complete a number of studies within a 45-month period and then comply with the rule as soon as possible after the next discharge permit renewal by a date determined by the permitting authorities. Portions of the final rule could apply to a number of Cleco’s fossil fuel steam electric generating stations. Until the required studies are conducted, including technical and economic evaluations of the control options available, and regulatory agency officials have reviewed the studies and made determinations, Cleco remains uncertain which technology options or retrofits will be required to be installed on its affected facilities. The costs of required technology options and retrofits may be significant, particularly if closed cycle cooling is required.
The CWA requires the EPA to periodically review and, if appropriate, revise technology-based effluent limitations guidelines for categories of industrial facilities, including power generating facilities. In September 2015, the EPA released the revised steam electric effluent limitation guidelines. The rule is focused on reducing the discharge of metals in wastewater from generating facilities to surface waters. The rule may require costly technological upgrades at Cleco’s facilities, particularly if additional wastewater treatment systems are required to be installed or if waste streams must be eliminated. Management is currently evaluating the effect of the final rule and is not able to predict if the new rule will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
Solid Waste Disposal
In the course of operations, Cleco’s facilities generate solid and hazardous waste materials requiring eventual disposal. The Solid Waste Division of the LDEQ has adopted a permitting system for the management and disposal of solid waste generated by power stations. Cleco has received all required permits from the LDEQ for the on-site disposal of solid waste from its generating stations.
In April 2015, the EPA published a final rule in the
Federal Register for regulating the disposal and management of CCRs from coal-fired power plants. The federal regulation classifies CCRs as nonhazardous waste under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and allows beneficial use of CCRs with some restrictions. 


The rule establishes extensive requirements for existing and new CCR landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions consisting of location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post closure care, and recordkeeping, notification, and Internet posting requirements. Management is currently evaluating the effect of the final rule requirements and is not able to predict if the rule will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
Cleco Power continues to be subject to state regulations pertaining to the disposal of coal ash. As a result, Cleco Power has an ARO for the retirement of certain ash disposal facilities. All costs of the CCR rule are expected to be recovered from customers in future rates. The actual asset retirement costs related to the CCR rule requirements may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the increased obligation due to the uncertainty about the compliance strategies that will be used and the preliminary nature of available data used to estimate costs. Cleco Power will continue to gather additional data in future periods and will make decisions about compliance strategies and the timing of closure activities. As additional information becomes available and management makes decisions about compliance strategies and the timing of closure activities, Cleco Power will update the ARO balance to reflect these changes in estimates. However, management does not expect any required adjustment to the ARO to have a material effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. At December 31, 2016, management’s analysis confirmed that no additional adjustments were needed to update Cleco Power’s ARO balance.
On December 16, 2016, the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act), including the WIIN Act’s provisions regarding CCRs was signed into law. The Act’s CCR provisions allow for implementation of the federal CCR rule through a state-based permit program. However, until the state of Louisiana has evaluated the Act and made a decision on implementing a state-based option, Cleco cannot determine the effects of the Act on the Registrants.
Cleco produces certain wastes that are classified as hazardous at its electric generating stations and at other locations. Cleco does not treat, store long-term, or dispose of these wastes on-site; therefore, no permits are required. Hazardous wastes produced by Cleco are properly disposed of at permitted hazardous waste disposal sites.
Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
The TSCA directs the EPA to regulate the marketing, disposing, manufacturing, processing, distributing in commerce, and usage of various toxic substances, including PCBs. Cleco operates and may continue to operate equipment containing PCBs under the TSCA. Once the equipment reaches the end of its useful life, the EPA regulates handling and disposing of the equipment and fluids containing PCBs. Within these regulations, handling and disposing is allowed only through facilities approved and permitted by the EPA. Cleco properly disposes of its PCB waste material at TSCA-permitted disposal facilities.

Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)
Section 313 of the EPCRA requires certain facilities that manufacture, process, or otherwise use minimum quantities of listed toxic chemicals to file an annual report with the EPA called a Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) report. The TRI report requires industrial facilities to report on approximately 650 substances that the facilities release into the air, water, and land. The TRI report ranks companies based on the amount of a particular substance they release on a state and parish (county) level. Annual reports are due to the EPA on July 1 following the reporting year-end. Cleco has submitted required TRI reports on its activities and the TRI rankings are available 


to the public. The rankings do not result in any federal or state penalties. 
Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMFs)
The possibility that exposure to EMFs emanating from electric power lines, household appliances, and other electric devices may result in adverse health effects, and damage to the environment has been a subject of some public attention. Lawsuits alleging that the presence of electric power transmission and distribution lines has an adverse effect on health and/or property values have arisen in several states. Cleco Power is not a party in any lawsuits related to EMFs.
