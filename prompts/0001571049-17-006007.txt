BUSINESS 
 ​

In addition to the United States, we operate in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and India. We offer core insurance software solutions for Property & Casualty/ General Insurance (“P&C”), Life, Annuities (“L&A”) & Pensions and Group / Employee Benefits providers, allowing them to manage policy administration, claims management and billing functions. In addition, we offer a variety of other technology-based solutions for distribution management, digital, data and cloud that enable organizations to automate business processes across the end-to-end insurance value chain and comply with policies and regulations across their organizations.

Our portfolio of solutions enable our customers to respond to evolving market needs, new opportunities and regulatory changes, enabling agility, innovation and speed while improving the effectiveness and efficiency of their business operations. 
 Majesco is a California corporation which was incorporated in April 1992 under the name Mastek Software, Inc. In 1995, this name was changed to Majesco Software, Inc., which was changed to MajescoMastek in 2006 and to Majesco in October 2014. 
 Our principal offices are located at 412 Mount Kemble Ave, Suite 110C, Morristown, NJ 07960, and our telephone number is (973) 461-5200. Our principal website is www.majesco.com. Information on our website does not constitute a part of, nor is it incorporated in any way, into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Majesco Reorganization 
 Majesco Limited (“Majesco Limited”), a public limited company domiciled in India whose equity shares are listed on the BSE Limited (Bombay Stock Exchange) and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited, currently owns 69.9% of our issued and outstanding common stock. 
 Previously, Majesco was 100% owned (directly and indirectly) by Mastek Limited (“Mastek”), a public limited company domiciled in India whose equity shares are listed on the BSE Limited (Bombay Stock Exchange) and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited. 
 Pursuant to a de-merger process which was completed on June 1, 2015, Mastek’s insurance-related business was separated from Mastek’s non-insurance related businesses and all insurance-related operations of Mastek that were not directly owned by Majesco were contributed to Majesco (such de-merger and reorganization process is referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the “Majesco Reorganization”). 
 In connection with the de-merger, 83.5% of Mastek’s then ownership interest in Majesco was transferred to a newly-formed company in India, called Majesco Limited, which was spun-off from Mastek. Mastek continues to own a 13.82% indirect minority interest in Majesco through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Mastek (UK) Ltd. 
 Agile Asset Acquisition 
 On January 1, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the insurance consulting business of Agile Technologies LLC, a business and technology management consulting firm (“Agile”), for a total estimated consideration of approximately $8.5 million with a total maximum of $9.2 million possible depending on earn-out payments. 
 Through this acquisition, we acquired the insurance-focused business and IT consulting business of Agile, as well as business transformation and process optimization capabilities, strategy enablement for data and digital and data services including data management and architecture strategy and services. In

  connection with this acquisition, over 55 insurance technology professionals and other personnel formerly employed or engaged by Agile became employees or independent contractors of Majesco. This acquisition also resulted in the addition of approximately 20 customers to our customer base. In connection with this acquisition, we assumed office leases under which Agile was lessee in New Jersey, Georgia and Ohio, and acquired certain trademarks, service marks, domain names and the business process framework of Agile. 
Cover-All Technologies Merger 
 On June 26, 2015, Cover-All Technologies Inc. (“Cover-All”), a provider of core insurance software and business analytics solution primarily focused on commercial lines for the property and casualty insurance industry listed on the NYSE MKT, merged into Majesco, with Majesco as the surviving corporation, in a stock-for-stock transaction. In the merger, each share of Cover-All common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than treasury shares) was automatically cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive 0.21641 shares of common stock of Majesco. This exchange ratio resulted in holders of issued and outstanding Cover-All common stock and outstanding options and restricted stock units and other equity awards of Cover-All holding in the aggregate approximately 16.5% of the total capitalization of the combined company immediately following consummation of the merger. 
 Cover-All’s customers include insurance companies, agents, brokers and managing general agents (“MGAs”) throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Cover-All’s software solutions and services are designed to enable customers to introduce new products quickly, expand their distribution channels, reduce costs and improve service to their customers. Cover-All’s business analytics solution enables customers to leverage their information assets for real time business insights and for better risk selection, pricing and financial reporting. In 2013, Cover-All announced the general availability of Cover-All Dev Studio, a visual configuration platform for building new and maintaining existing pre-built commercial insurance products for Cover-All Policy. In 2011, Cover-All expanded its portfolio of insurance solutions by acquiring the assets of a recognized claims solution provider, Ho’ike Services, Inc. (doing business as BlueWave Technology). 
 In connection with the merger, we listed our common stock with the NYSE MKT under the symbol “MJCO” and began trading under this symbol on the NYSE MKT following the consummation of the merger.

We are a global provider of core insurance software and consulting services for insurance business transformation for P&C, L&A and Group/Employee Benefits providers, allowing them to enable the entire insurance value chain.

  one insurance carriers in the industry to mid-market insurers, startups and greenfields, including specialty, mutual and regional carriers. As of March 31, 2017, we served approximately 148 insurance customers on a worldwide basis. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017, March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, we served approximately 148, 149 and 108 insurance customers on a worldwide basis, respectively. 
 We generate revenues primarily from the licensing of our proprietary software and related implementation, support and maintenance fees pursuant to contracts with customers. The license agreements typically range in length from fixed-year terms (which maybe renewable) to perpetual terms. Support services are provided to customers pursuant to multi-year support agreements, which are typically renewable on an annual basis post the initial term of the agreement. We bill customers for license fees in accordance with the terms of the license agreement, typically payable upon the signing of the agreement and achievement of milestones over the course of a defined period of time. Support fees are payable in advance by the customer on an annualized, quarterly or monthly basis. We primarily derive service revenues from implementation and training services performed for our customers under the terms of a service contract on a time and materials or fixed-price basis. We also generate revenue from software as a service which includes an upfront setup fee, implementation and usage based subscription. 
 For the past several years, we have:

 Overview of the Insurance Industry 
 The insurance industry is large, fragmented, highly regulated and complex. In order to effectively manage their operations, insurance carriers require core business systems that integrate with other internal systems, control workflow, enable extensive configurability and provide visibility to every user. 
 The insurance industry is in the midst of profound change fueled by trends that are converging and pushing a sometimes slow-to-adapt industry. This seismic shift is creating leaps in innovation and disruption, challenging the traditional business assumptions, operations, processes and products of the last 30 – 50 years. Insurance carriers are currently faced with a wide range of challenges. Increasing competition, emerging technologies and changing customer expectations are pushing carriers to make their business more agile, improve their time to market for new products, reach new markets, expand channels and respond quickly to market changes. 
 Many insurance carriers are experiencing increased operational risk and financial loss due to the inadequacy of their existing legacy core systems. The inherent functional and technical limitations of these systems have impeded carriers’ ability to grow profitability and adapt to the evolving expectations of consumer, commercial and government insurance customers. Most organizations can’t simply flip off one switch (traditional business model and products administered on traditional systems) and flip another on

  (new business model and products on modern, flexible systems that will handle digital integration and better data acquisition and analysis). So, the shift will require steps. Those steps will operate as both a bridge and a proving ground, with the traditional system still operational as a firm foundation while the new foundation is being constructed.
