ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, as used herein the terms “General Steel”, the “Company”, “we”, “our” and “us” all refer to General Steel Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 
We were incorporated on August 5, 2002, in the State of Nevada. We are headquartered in Beijing, China and through our 100% owned subsidiary, General Steel Investment, we have been operating steel companies serving various industries in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). Our main operation through December 30, 2015 had been the manufacturing and sales of steel products such as steel rebar, hot-rolled carbon and silicon sheets and spiral-weld pipes.
 
Our remaining steel business is primarily comprised of Tianjin Shuangsi Trading Co. Ltd, (“Tianjin Shuangsi”), a trading company that mainly sources overseas iron ore for steel mills. We acquired a 100% equity interest in Tianjin Shuangsi on February 16, 2016. On December 31, 2017, the Company sold Shuangsi for RMB 20,000,000 (approximately $2.88 million) so the result of operations was presented as operations to be disposed in December 31, 2016 in the consolidated financial statements See Note 2(o) – Operations held for sale and operations disposed/to be disposed.
 
As a result of this restructuring, our former steel-related subsidiaries, including Longmen Joint Venture (prior to December 30, 2015), Maoming Hengda and our recently acquired non steel-related subsidiary, Catalon and Shuangsi, all of which represented a majority of our consolidated sales and operations, are presented as discontinued operations or operations held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 
Recent Developments
 
On July 18, 2016, we received a notice from the staff of the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) stating that the NYSE had determined to commence proceedings to delist our common stock, and our common stock would be suspended at the close of trading on the same date.
 
In the notice and in a public announcement distributed by the NYSE on July 18, 2016, the NYSE stated that we were previously deemed below compliance with the NYSE’s continued listing standard requiring listed companies to maintain either (i) at least $50 million in stockholders’ equity or (ii) at least $50 million in total market capitalization on a 30 trading day average basis. The NYSE noted that they had previously accepted our 18-month plan to regain compliance with the listing standard. However, the NYSE stated that as of the expiration of the plan period on July 9, 2016, we were unable to demonstrate that we had regained compliance with the applicable continued listing standard. The NYSE also included in its public announcement that we were delayed in filing with the SEC of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter end March 31, 2016.
 
We appealed the delisting determination by submitting a request for review in writing to the NYSE Regulations, Inc., Board of Directors’ Committee for Review (the “CFR”)
 
Prior to the NYSE notice, we had presented to the NYSE the steps we intended to take to address the deficiencies raised by the staff at NYSE. We reached an agreement with a number of our current debt holders to forgive existing debt and/or exchange debt for equity, which when completed, would have increased our stockholders’ equity to at least $50 million thereby satisfying the NYSE’s continued listing standard.
 
On October 20, 2016, we received a letter from the CFR that our appeal was denied. On October 25, 2016, our common stock was delisted.

Operations held for sale:
 
Our remaining steel business is primarily comprised of Tianjin Shuangsi Trading Co. Ltd, (“Tianjin Shuangsi”), a trading company that mainly sources overseas iron ore for steel mills. We acquired a 100% equity interest in Tianjin Shuangsi on February 16, 2016. On December 31, 2017, the Company sold Shuangsi to Wendler Investment & Management Group Co., Ltd, a related party, no consideration was received.
 
Subsidiaries disposed:
 
Maoming Hengda Steel Co., Ltd
 
On June 25, 2008, through our subsidiary Qiu Steel, we paid approximately $7.1 million (RMB 50 million) in cash to purchase 99% of Maoming Hengda Steel Group, Ltd. (“Maoming Hengda”).  The total registered capital of Maoming Hengda is approximately $77.8 million (RMB 544.6 million)
 
Maoming Hengda’s core business was the production of rebar products used in the construction industry.  Located on 140 hectares (approximately 346 acres) in Maoming city, Guangdong Province, the Maoming Hengda facility previously had two production lines capable of annual production capacities of 1.8 million metric tons of 5.5mm to 16mm diameter high-speed wire and 12mm to 38mm diameter rebar. The products were sold through nine distributors that targeted customers in Guangxi Province and the western region of Guangdong. To take advantage of a stronger market demand in Shaanxi Province, between 2009 and 2010, we relocated the 1.8 million metric ton capacity rebar production line and high-speed wire production line from Maoming Hengda's facility to Longmen Joint Venture.
 
In December 2010, we brought online a new 400,000 ton capacity rebar production line. On December 15, 2013, Maoming Hengda entered into a lease agreement with Zhongshan Baohua Rebar Factory, with which Maoming Hengda leased the 400,000 ton capacity rebar production line and various other buildings and equipment to Zhongshan Baohua Rebar Factory, for an annual payment of $1.2 million (RMB 7.2 million) for eight years between March 2014 and February 2022.
 
Management evaluates the fair value of Maoming Hengda’s long-lived assets on an annual basis, or upon a triggering event which would require an assessment sooner. As of December 31, 2015, Management is of the opinion that the fair value of the property, plant and equipment exceeded their current carrying value.
 
On March 21, 2016, we sold our equity interest in Maoming Hengda to Tianwu Tongyong (Tianjin) International Trade Co., Ltd, ("Tianwu Tongyong"), for which the Company already had 32% equity interest in, for RMB 328.0 million in cash or approximately $50.5 million and with this transaction completed the full divestiture of our steel manufacturing and distribution business was completed. The agreement was further amended in September 2016 to set the sale price at RMB 155.3 million or approximately $23.9 million. The amount was collected in April 2017.

Accordingly, the Company recorded the total amount of net consideration of $45.7 million in additional-paid-in capital.
 
Catalon Chemical Corp. 
 
In October 2015, we acquired an 84.5% equity interest in Catalon Chemical Corp. (“Catalon”), a Delaware corporation headquartered in Virginia that develops and manufactures De-NOx honeycomb catalysts and industrial ceramics.  Prior to December 31, 2015, we became aware of some operational issues related to Catalon. It was determined that such issues might have affected Catalon’s prior operations as well as its ability to conduct business in the future. As such, we are expected to cancel the shares issued to the 84.5% original owners of Catalon in accordance with the terms of the agreement at the end of 2016. Because we have decided to dispose of Catalon in the near future, we are presenting Catalon’s remaining assets, after impairment charges, and liabilities as held for sale as of December 31, 2015 in the consolidated financial statements. Due to operational issues, Catalon was not able to meet the Minimum Sales Target or Minimum Net Profit applicable as stipulated in the Stock Exchange agreement, therefore the board has voted unanimously to cancel the shares that were placed in escrow for the selling shareholders. As such the Company deconsolidated Catalon on March 31, 2016. See Note 2(o) in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
Tianjin Shuangsi 
 
Our remaining steel business is primarily comprised of Tianjin Shuangsi Trading Co. Ltd, (“Tianjin Shuangsi”), a trading company that mainly sources overseas iron ore for steel mills. We acquired a 100% equity interest in Tianjin Shuangsi on February 16, 2016. On December 31, 2017, the Company sold Shuangsi for RMB 20,000,000 (approximately $2.88 million) so the result of operations was presented as operations to be disposed in December 31, 2016 in the consolidated financial statements See Note 2(o) – Operations held for sale and operations disposed/to be disposed.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 5 full-time employees.
