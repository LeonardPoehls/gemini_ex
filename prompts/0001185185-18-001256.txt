Overview
 
We are engaged in the development, integration and marketing of rugged mobile personal computer and hand held devices. Our rugged devices are designed to withstand hazardous conditions, such as extreme temperatures, driving rain, repeated vibrations, dirt, dust and concussive shocks.  The intrinsically safe, ruggedized and reliable nature of our products facilitates the extension of traditional computing systems to a broader range of field personnel, including energy pipeline inspectors, public safety responders, warehouse workers and pharmaceutical scientists.  Our devices are fitted with a range of performance-matched accessories, including multiple docking solutions, wireless connectivity alternatives, global positioning system modules, biometric and smartcard options, as well as traditional peripherals, such as keyboards and cases.  Additionally, our most rugged devices are waterproof for up to 30 minutes in water up to a depth of three feet, are impervious to drops from as high as seven feet, are readable in direct sunlight, can be mounted on vehicles and include LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity options for real-time data access.  Our end-user customers include major telecommunications companies, leading heavy equipment manufacturers, vehicle manufacturers, healthcare providers, oil and gas production companies, the military and first responders.
 
Through 2014, we focused on a single ultra-rugged tablet, the iX014, through multiple generations of that product.  In 2014, we began the introduction of multiple fully-rugged and rugged tablets that are lighter and less expensive than our original product.  In 2015, we acquired the assets of Motion Computing, Inc., or Motion, another producer of rugged tablets, which acquisition was designed to expand our market share and reach.  During our fiscal year 2018, we refined our focus yet again.  We redefined our business model as a provider of rugged mobility systems, and began the process of introducing even more rugged products, such as the XBOOK 2-in-1 device and the Xplore M60 handheld device.  We made these changes in order to expand our addressable market and to serve the needs of our existing end-users and distribution channels.
 
Our rugged mobile device portfolio has offerings in both Windows and Android.  We believe that by having a broader portfolio of products, in terms of ruggedness, price and operating systems, we can address a broader range of end user needs.  Looking forward, our strategy is to build increased market awareness of our product offerings, in an effort designed to increase our revenue and expand our share of the markets addressed by those offerings.
 
We believe that we are positioned for future revenue growth in the markets in which we compete.  We have introduced a line of devices that, based upon third‑party certifications, surpasses the performance standards and specifications that have been the accepted measures for rugged tablet devices in today’s marketplace.
 
Our key initiatives for future revenue growth include the following:
 
 
• | New product development—based on input from customer and key industry participants;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The expansion of sales activities in non-U.S. markets, particularly in Europe;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continued penetration into the Fortune 500/Global 2000 markets;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establishment of key relationships with new distributors; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expanded focus on military and public safety markets.
--+------------------------------------------------------



The timing of large orders, and the related shipping dates of the ordered products, creates variability in our reported revenues.  While we may experience some variability in our quarterly operating results as a consequence of the impact of large orders, our goal is to grow our year-over-year revenues.  Our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 was approximately 12% higher than the prior fiscal year.
 
We are a Delaware corporation and our common stock trades on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol “XPLR.” Following the consummation of the Merger, there will be no public market for our common stock, which will cease to be traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market, and we will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Recent Developments
 
In fiscal year 2016, we introduced two new products, the XSLATE B10 and the XSLATE D10, which were the replacements for our former RangerX product.  In fiscal year 2017, we introduced the XSLATE R12, which was a replacement for our former Motion R12 product.  Our products are described in more detail below.
 
On April 17, 2017, our existing Loan and Security Agreement with Square 1 Bank matured and was replaced by a Loan and Security Agreement with Bank of America N.A., which we call the Bank of America Credit Agreement, pursuant to which Bank of America provided us with a revolving asset based line of credit of up to $15 million.  The new facility with Bank of America, which initially had a three-year term, is secured by substantially all of our assets, and bears interest at LIBOR plus between 2.25% and 2.75% per annum, based upon our fixed charge coverage ratio.  The balance of drawn funds at any one time cannot exceed the lesser of $15 million or the sum of (1) 85% of our eligible accounts receivable and (2) the lesser of (a) 65% of the carried value of eligible inventory or (b) 85% of the liquidation value of eligible inventory, minus certain reserves.  The maximum amount of eligible receivables comprised of accounts receivable outside of the United States of America and Canada is 25% of the balance of eligible accounts receivable.
 
The Bank of America Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant regarding our available liquidity, which is tested monthly.  Our failure to meet this covenant, or the triggering of other events of default under the Bank of America Credit Agreement, could result in acceleration of all of our payment obligations and the termination of the obligations of Bank of America to make loans and extend credit to us under the Bank of America Credit Agreement. The Bank of America Credit Agreement contains certain representations and warranties made by us and certain conditions that we must met to cause Bank of America to make loans under the facility.  The Bank of America Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and remedies upon default, including acceleration.
 
Effective January 25, 2018, the Bank of America Credit Agreement was amended to increase our line of credit to $20 million and to extend the termination date to January 25, 2021.
 
On July 3, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to Loan and Security Agreement with Bank of America, to be effective as of May 30, 2018.  The amendment provides for additional borrowing capacity under the underlying line of credit by increasing the number of eligible accounts receivable against which we can borrow under the credit agreement.  The amendment also adjusts certain triggers leading to enhanced reporting by us under the agreement. As of March 31, 2018, we had drawn $14,159,000 on this line of credit, and as of June 30, 2018, we had drawn $12,405,000.
 
In February 2018, we introduced two new products, the XBOOK B10 and XBOOK D10, both of which are rugged 2-in-1 devices.  In May 2018, we introduced the Xplore M60, a rugged handheld device.  Our products are described in more detail below.
 
Products
 
Our devices offer the following features:
 
Rugged— We have designed and built our tablet products from the inside out, developing design elements that provide a heightened and proven level of durability.  Some of our products meet some of the strictest specifications in the world, such as those established by the U.S. military, including Military Standard Testing for Environmental Extremes.  By being designed to meet these specifications, some of our products can withstand damage from being dropped onto concrete from a height of up to seven feet, from being submerged for up to 30 minutes in up to three feet of water, and from being exposed to extreme temperatures are as low as −60° Fahrenheit and as high as 160° Fahrenheit.  In addition, some of our products are designed to continue to function when subjected to vibration, sand storms and other challenging outdoor work environments.
 
For our hand held products, we leveraged available housing designs, and then built our products from the inside with the assistance of our contract manufacturers.  We expect to be able to swiftly bring products and modifications to the market using this approach.  As handheld devices have less concerns regarding heat disbursement, we have been able to create sealed devices with less ports.  We expect these devices to have robust bar code scanning capabilities, so we focused on delivering the products with a rugged bar code scanner integrated into the device.  Our handheld products can withstand damage from being dropped from four feet and are waterproof.  They have a temperature range from 0° Fahrenheit to as high as 120° Fahrenheit.  In addition, our products are designed to continue to function when subjected to vibration, sand storms and other challenging outdoor work environments.

In particular, we believe our functional, durable and reliable docking solutions are tailored to our customers’ needs.  We have supplied service, desktop, vehicle, forklift, armored vehicle and mobile cart docking systems to our customers.
Heightened Safety Standards— Some models of our line of wireless-enabled tablet PC systems have been tested and certified both in North America and in the European Union for use in hazardous conditions.
 
Our devices are designed to be used as a mobile computing system.  These systems are comprised of a hardware platform that is fully integrated with one or more software applications.  Through its wide feature set, we believe our line of products allows for the customization of a platform that best suits any given application.  Our computers combine processing power, viewability, ruggedness and connectivity, and are designed to operate in extreme environments.
 
Set forth below are descriptions of the various product lines that we offer.
 
iX104 Product Line
 
We have spent more than a decade on research, development and product improvements with each generation of our iX104 ultra-rugged tablet, achieving what we believe are a number of industry “firsts,” such as being the first manufacturer to incorporate dual-mode inputs with active pen and finger touch capabilities.  Our signature iX104 tablets have consistently been recognized for their ruggedness, versatility and best-in-class technologies.  We believe that we pioneered, and continue to offer, the best outdoor‑readable display and wLAN wireless solutions.  Our specially designed Dual Mode Sunlight Readable screen is viewable in challenging lighting conditions, including direct sunlight and dimly-lit environments, from virtually any angle.
 
We believe that our recent versions of the iX104 have continued to introduce “industry firsts” and differentiating features.

Motion F5m/C5m
 
The Motion F5m and Motion C5m are easily recognized by their iconic integrated handle design, which was introduced by Motion in 2008.  The Motion C5 was originally introduced in white for clinical applications.  Motion then followed up with a black version of the Motion C5, the Motion F5, for field applications.  The rugged tablets’ fifth generation Intel Core processors, including the highest performing Intel i7 vPro processor, provide the power to quickly move through computation-intensive applications, while increasing overall power efficiency for longer battery life.
 
 These products have a 10.4” View Anywhere display that mimics the size of many standard forms for which input is made easy with both touch and digital pen interfaces.  An optional barcode scanner is integrated into the handle for easy push-button reads.  A high resolution digital camera and the “SnapWorks by Xplore” camera application make it easy to capture images, annotate those images with the pen, and share the data with other applications.  An optional UHF RFID scanner enables long range reads of RFID tags up to nine feet away.  And, the “EasyConnect” expansion module can be populated with a magstripe reader to accept payments in real-time at the point of service.
 
These products are often used in large metropolitan areas, where LTE networks are susceptible to traffic congestion that negatively impacts connectivity performance.  To overcome that challenge, the products were designed and certified to support the additional spectrum of AWS (Advanced Wireless Services), commonly marketed by some carriers as XLTE. 
 
Bobcat
 At 2.4 pounds, the Bobcat is a fully-rugged Windows tablet with comprehensive standardized interfaces, an array of options through its proprietary Xpansion Port and a lightweight design.  The Bobcat operates Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 Pro operating systems and is certified fully-rugged, with a MIL-STD 810G certification and IP65 rating.  The Bobcat’s direct bonded IPS screen, 500 nits of luminance and an 800-to-1 contrast ratio provides for outdoor readability, and a 10-finger multi-touch screen provides users with ease-of-use and touch optimization.  The Bobcat is used in a variety of industries, including manufacturing, warehousing and distribution, utilities, telecommunications and the military.
 
Bobcat offers a suite of standard inputs and outputs, enabling the transition across different business applications.  The Bobcat comes with two full-sized USB 3.0s, Micro SDXC, Micro SIM, Micro HDMI-Out, RJ-45 Ethernet, GPS engine and a serial port connection.

Marketing and distribution relationships— Within each targeted vertical market, we intend to focus on entering into co-marketing relationships with key application providers and systems integrators.  This strategy is designed to allow us to use multiple sales channels within a region, while maintaining key strategic alliances.
 
Sales
 
Our direct customers primarily consist of distribution companies, such as large computer companies, specialized system integrators, software vendors, distributors and value-added resellers, and to a lesser extent end-users of our devices.  For fiscal year 2018, approximately 92% of our total revenues were attributable to sales through our distribution and reseller channels, and approximately 8% of our total revenues were attributable to sales directly to end-users.  We currently have relationships with more than 120 distributors and direct resellers.  Our distributors and resellers generally have large sales organizations that, in turn, sell our products to entities that are the ultimate end-users.  In any given year, a single distributor may account for a significant portion of our revenue.  In fiscal year 2018, we had three resellers located in the United States who accounted for approximately 45% of our total revenue in the aggregate.
 
As of March 31, 2018, we had a sales team of twenty-three individuals that either have geographic responsibilities for direct and indirect sales opportunities or responsibilities for specific enterprise customers, without limitation by geography.  Our regional and international sales teams work closely with our distributors and resellers in defined regions.  Our enterprise sales team works on specific large accounts and industry verticals.  Our distributors are currently selling our products into the public safety, utility, telecommunications, field service, warehousing logistics, transportation, oil and gas production, manufacturing, route delivery, military and homeland security markets.
 
Our North American revenue was approximately 70% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2018, as compared to approximately 73% of total revenue in fiscal year 2017.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Product Marketing
 
Our product marketing work starts with aligning our product development plans with the anticipated needs of our target end-users.  We recognize that, as a smaller company, our key to success depends on our ability to provide better products than our larger competitors, and to be more responsive to our customers’ needs.  As such, our product innovations are grounded in combining emerging technologies with customer needs.  When embarking on the development of a new product or an upgrade of an existing one, we devote resources to engaging end-users, distributors and industry experts in the design process.  We believe that this process, combined with our flexibility to make quick decisions with the support of our contract manufacturers, has enabled us to deliver products with market leading technology ahead of our competitors.
 
The market prices for rugged devices are higher than those for commercial grade devices used in traditional office settings.  However, we believe that the total cost of ownership of a rugged device over a three to five-year period can be significantly lower than the cost of a cheaper non-rugged computer in certain environments.  Several of our customers have disclosed in our customer‑based market research studies that they experienced higher direct costs using non-rugged devices, with more frequent damage, information retrieval costs and replacement costs, as well as higher indirect costs, such as prolonged downtime.  This conclusion is also supported by third-party research.
 
Market Segments
 
We target a number of different market segments in which we believe the deployment of rugged mobile computers can greatly improve operating efficiencies, reduce related costs, and improve end-user service levels.
 
9
 


Telecommunications, Utilities & Energy.  Generally, to remain competitive, telecommunications, utility and energy related companies continuously have to respond to their customers’ requests for service and infrastructure maintenance expeditiously and efficiently.  We believe that the reliable and real-time movement of information to and from the field is vital to the success of any field automation system.  To fully leverage the value of mobile computing in these environments, the devices must also be safe to use in hazardous environments where explosive gases may be present – particularly relevant to the oil and gas industry.  We have responded with products that are compliant with C1D2 and ATEX standards for use in these environments.  Two global top ten telecommunications providers in the world are end-users of our products, as well as several of the world’s largest utility and energy companies, including Hydro One in Canada, EDF in France, RWE in Germany, Sydney Water in Australia, and Thames Water in the United Kingdom.
Military.  As the military continues to transition to commercial and industrial grade rugged mobile computing systems, we expect this market segment will represent a significant opportunity for our products.  In particular, we believe the U.S. Department of Defense is generally moving away from full military specifications adherence, except for system‑critical operations, and instead is increasing emphasis on purchasing commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment.  The military market sector includes ground and C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence) systems.  We have deployed solutions across the Army, Air Force, and Navy in the U. S., as well as military operations in other countries. 
Public Safety. Given the focus in the U.S. on homeland security matters and the continued commitment by Federal, state and municipal governments on law enforcement, fire and emergency medical services, members of the public safety sector are searching for efficiencies that will better enable them to do their jobs.  Rugged mobile computing devices assist these groups in a variety of ways.  For example, having a reliable and durable tablet computer provides law enforcement agencies with immediate and reliable access in the field to national and local criminal databases.  In this market segment, our products have been sold to hundreds of public safety organizations across the world, including the Abu Dhabi Police, Danish Ambulance Service, and the German Red Cross.
 
Manufacturing.  Manufacturing floor environments demand resiliency and mobility, and require more rugged computing power than ever before, to store large amounts of data and display complex and highly detailed drawings.  Whether assembly, maintenance, or repair operations are confined to an indoor factory, an enclosed hangar, or an outdoor testing facility, the environmental elements and vibrations from equipment and forklifts can be harmful to the average computing device.  Our rugged tablet IP ratings and the results of extensive MIL-STD-810G tests are particularly relevant to this segment.  We have experienced particular success in the Automotive and Aerospace sectors of this market segment, with end-users that include Boeing, Bombardier in Canada, Embraer in Brazil, Dassault Aviation in France, Audi in Germany, and Volkswagen in Italy.
 
Transportation and Distribution.  We believe that globalization, increased competition and heightened consumer expectations are contributing factors to the adoption of mobile computing technologies by many leading transportation and distribution companies.  That means mobilizing highly complex and integrated logistical tasks in a way that is simple and straightforward, whether on planes, trains, forklifts or tractor-trailers.  These operations typically require real time price modifications, product introductions and transitions, timely inventory management, load balancing and scheduling.  We believe that this market segment will continue to automate order fulfillment, inventory control and management systems as part of an overall effort to integrate enterprise resource planning and supply chain management information systems.  Our end-users include leading railroad, trucking and airline companies, package delivery companies, as well as the warehouse operations of large automotive manufacturing and food processing plants.  We have a diverse set of customers in this segment, including Norfolk Southern, CSX, UPS, and Hertz.
 
Research and Development
 
We have assembled an experienced engineering and product development team.  Through the collaboration of our employees and the engineering teams of our contract manufacturers, we believe we are able to bring significant resources to the research, development and design of our products.
 
We seek to design and manage product life cycles through a controlled and structured process.  We involve customers and industry experts from our target markets in the definition and refinement of our product development.  Product development emphasis is placed on meeting industry standards and product specifications, ease of integration, ease of use, cost reduction, design-for manufacturability, quality and reliability. 
 
We continue to invest in research and development to enhance and expand our rugged mobile devices.  We are considering additional form factors, operating systems and screen technologies for integration into our rugged devices as we seek to expand into additional markets.  During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, we expended $3,354,000 and $4,462,000, respectively, on research and development activities, none of which was borne by our customers.

Competition
 
Competition in our industry is intense and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and rapid changes in end-user requirements.  To be competitive, we must continue to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products and product features that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards, and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of end-users.  We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products are the products’ performance, features and reliability, price, customer service, reputation in the industry and brand loyalty.  We believe that our strongest competitive advantages are our products’ durability and reputation in the industry.  In order to compete, we will be required to continue to respond promptly and effectively to the challenges of technological changes and our competitors’ innovations.
 
Our primary competitors in the mobile rugged computer market include the following:
 
 
· | Panasonic. Panasonic is the largest provider of mobile rugged computers and offers a series of traditional and convertible notebooks. Panasonic promotes a rugged computer, known as the Toughbook, which is well known in the industry.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Panasonic and Getac have more product offerings and greater financial, technical, and research and development resources and marketing capabilities than we do.  Dell has greater financial, technical, and research and development resources and marketing capabilities than we do.  DRS produces tablets with specific connectivity required by the U.S. Military.
 
We also face competition from manufacturers of non-rugged mobile devices, such as Samsung, Dell, Hewlett‑Packard, Apple, Sony and Toshiba, to the extent end-users decide to purchase less expensive traditional devices for use in environments that we believe are better suited for mobile rugged devices.
 
Manufacturing
 
We have a scalable manufacturing infrastructure to support our manufacturing operations.  Our primary contract manufacturers, Wistron Corporation (Wistron), Pegatron Corporation (Pegatron) and Ubiqconn Technology, Inc. (Ubiqconn), are located in Taiwan.  Wistron, the supplier of our iX104 and XSLATE B10 products, is recognized as a leading provider of computers and electronic components to some of the world’s largest technology companies, including Dell and Hewlett‑Packard.  Pegatron, the supplier of our XSLATE R12 and F5/C5 products, is also a leading provider of computers and electronic components to the world’s largest technology companies.  Ubiqconn, the supplier of our XSLATE D10 and Bobcat products, was spun off from the First International Computer (FIC) Group in 2011 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FIC.  FIC has been a dominant force in technology research, product development and manufacturing services since 1980.  Ubiqconn is comprised of FIC’s Industrial Computer Business Unit and FIC’s original research and development team, which has accumulated over twenty years of experience in developing IT products for worldwide first tier companies.  We contract with BeiJing UniStrong Science & Technology, Ltd. (UniStrong) for the production of our Xplore M60 rugged handheld device.  We expect our relationships with our contract manufacturers will support our expected sales and product demand for the foreseeable future.
 
We outsource the majority of our manufacturing services for our rugged devices to our contract manufacturers, including board production, parts procurement, assembly, some quality assurance testing, warranty repair and service.  We have design and manufacturing agreements with our contract manufacturers and they collaborate with us on product specifications and provide us with the flexibility to make changes to our products as market conditions change.
 
Under the terms of our agreements with our contract manufacturers for our tablets and 2-in-1 devices, they provide us with design, manufacturing and support services related to our rugged devices.  The purchase price of our products is determined based on the specific configuration of the device being produced, and may be subject to cost reduction plans and volume based discounts.  At least quarterly, we meet with each of our contract manufacturers to develop cost reduction plans.  The plans take into account alternative suppliers along with components, design, process changes and other cost savings procedures.  Each month we provide the contract manufacturers with a six month rolling forecast of the products we anticipate ordering.  Generally, each of the contract manufacturers have approximately 90 days after its acceptance of our purchase order to ship the product.  If products ordered during any quarter exceed the volume projected in the forecast, each of the contract manufacturers has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to deliver the excess products within 45 days after its acceptance of the applicable purchase order.

Our contract manufacturers provide several warranties to us, including that they have all necessary rights required to sell the products, that each product will be free from any material defect, that the products will be free from any liens, encumbrances or defects in title and that the products will comply with all specifications.  The current terms of our agreements with our contract manufacturers are for one year and automatically renew for additional one year terms, unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 90 days prior to the expiration of any renewal term.  In addition, the agreements contain provisions that allow for termination for any reason by either party upon 120 days’ notice.
 
We purchase materials, supplies and product subassemblies for our rugged mobile personal computer tablets and 2-in-1 devices from a number of vendors.  Some key components included in our line of products are currently available only from single or limited sources.  In the past, we have experienced significant price increases and limited availability of certain components that are not available from multiple sources.  We are dependent upon Microsoft Corporation for various software products, including products included in our rugged devices.
 
Like other participants in the computer manufacturing industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our requirements for periods averaging 90 to 150 days.  At times, we have been constrained by parts availability in meeting our product orders.  From time to time, we have obtained scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market, which may have a negative impact on our gross margins on our products, but does not disrupt production.  On occasion, we have also acquired component inventory from our suppliers in anticipation of supply constraints.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our performance and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degree on our proprietary technology.  We rely primarily upon a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and license agreements to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and technology.  On March 31, 2018, we had thirty-eight U.S. patents and thirteen non-US patents.  In addition, we had one U.S. patent application, one Chinese patent application, one European Union patent application and one Taiwanese patent application related to proprietary elements of our tablet devices, and one U.S. patent application, one Taiwanese patent application and one International PCT patent application related to our wireless dock.  Even with patent protection, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without our authorization, or to develop similar technology independently.  In addition, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries.
 
We do not believe that any of our products infringe on the proprietary rights of any third parties.  There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our licensees with respect to our current or future products.  In the past, we have had third parties assert exclusive patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights to technologies or marks that are important to our business.  Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the claimant, any of which could delay the development and commercialization of our products or increase the costs of our products.  Since 2015, three companies have filed lawsuits against us for alleged infringement of their patents by the products we acquired from Motion.  We have settled two of the lawsuits by entering into license agreements, with a modest one-time payment for each.  We believe that we have no potential liability to the third claimant because we had, and continue to have, an existing license agreement with that company.  We have received correspondence from one additional company alleging infringement of their patent, and offering to enter into a license agreement with a modest fee.
 
We work closely with our contract manufacturers to stay abreast of the latest developments in rugged mobile technology.  We obtain patent licenses for some technologies, some of which require significant royalty payments, when we believe those licenses are necessary or advantageous to our business.  We have entered into non-exclusive licensing arrangements with Microsoft and other software suppliers for various operating systems and application software that we sell with our rugged devices.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our business is subject to regulation by various federal and state governmental agencies in the United States.  Such regulation includes the radio frequency emission regulatory activities of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the anti-trust regulatory activities of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice, the consumer protection laws of the Federal Trade Commission, the import/export regulatory activities of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the product safety regulatory activities of the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission and environmental regulation by a variety of regulatory authorities in each of the areas in which we conduct business.
 

12
 


Our business is subject to additional government regulation related to our international operations, including local trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, pricing and marketing of products, and local labor regulations, including local labor issues faced by our suppliers and OEMs.  We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, as a result of our business operations in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, where companies engage in business practices prohibited by the FCPA.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2018, we had 95 full-time employees, of which 48 were employed in the operations, engineering, research and development and customer support areas, nine were involved in corporate, finance and administrative areas and 38 were employed in sales and marketing.  We anticipate that we will need to hire additional employees going forward.  Our employees are not represented by a union or other collective bargaining unit and we have never experienced a work stoppage.  We believe that our employee relations are good.
Trademarks and Service Marks
 
Each trademark, trade name or service mark of any other company appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K belongs to its holder.
