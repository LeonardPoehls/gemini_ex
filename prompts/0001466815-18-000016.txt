Item 1. Business. 
Unless otherwise expressly indicated in this Item 1, the discussions set forth herein are as of December 31, 2017. The “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” when used in this report refers to Cambium Learning Group, Inc. and its predecessors and consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. 
Overview 
Cambium Learning® Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed in 2009, is an award-winning educational technology solutions leader dedicated to helping all students reach their potential through individualized and differentiated instruction. Using a research-based, personalized approach, Cambium Learning Group delivers software as a service (SaaS) resources and instructional products that engage students and support teachers in fun, positive, safe and scalable environments. These solutions are provided through Learning A-Z® (online differentiated instruction for elementary school reading, writing and science), ExploreLearning® (online interactive math and science simulations and a math fact fluency solution), and Voyager Sopris Learning® (blended solutions that accelerate struggling learners to achieve in literacy and math and professional development for teachers). The following core beliefs form the foundation of our value proposition:

• | Every student has untapped potential. Our solutions recognize that each student has a unique set of skills, aptitudes, and experiences that he or she brings to the classroom, which is why our programs provide individualized learning paths and personalized learning environments that honor and build from where a student’s academic journey begins.


• | Teachers are the foundation—their importance must be valued. We believe that the biggest contributing factor to a student’s success in school is the presence of a knowledgeable and caring teacher, so our curriculum support and professional development services promote a true partnership that is flexible to unique needs.


• | Data, instruction, and practice drive improvement. The unique capabilities afforded through technology give teachers and students more agility—easily enabling them to not only adapt, engage, mobilize, and move learning beyond the classroom walls, but also to quantify progress, respond to data trends, and individualize instruction like never before.

Learning A-Z Segment
Learning A-Z is a literacy-focused PreK-6 educational provider of technology-enabled learning resources. Founded in 2002, Learning A-Z’s resources are now used by more than 5 million students in more than 170 countries. Learning A-Z products blend traditional teacher-led instruction with robust online resources to make teaching more effective and efficient, practice more accessible and personalized, assessment more strategic and automated, and learning more informed and proactive. With a comprehensive and blended approach, Learning A-Z delivers the tools students need without limiting a teacher’s ability to differentiate instruction as they see fit. Learning A-Z’s approach to literacy emphasizes knowledge and individual potential by recognizing that while reading and writing remain essential to attaining academic success, they are dynamic and dependent on real-world application and the incorporation of many other 21st century skills. Students today must read and write well, and they must also be able to think critically and analyze what they learn, solve problems, innovate and apply creativity, utilize advancing technology, communicate effectively orally and in writing, and collaborate with their peers. With a robust library of incredibly effective and flexible curriculum resources, Learning A-Z provides the tools teachers need to deliver personalized instruction for a wide range of student needs. 
Learning A-Z Solutions
Reading A-Z includes an extensive collection of resources, including leveled books, lesson plans, and teaching materials, ideal for whole-class, small-group, and one-to-one reading instruction.

Each domain has a number of key units across three grade bands: K-2, 3-6, and 5-6. While intended as powerful supplement resources to augment daily science instruction, the program contains all the content needed for a core science curriculum. Science A-Z gives teachers access to a vast, easy-to-use library of resources, and engages students with experiments and activities designed to put science and engineering into practice and to expand learning opportunities.
Writing A-Z provides the differentiated materials and instruction tools K-6 educators need to teach writing in the classroom. With an extensive collection of lessons and instructional resources differentiated at five developmental levels, teachers can easily provide the lessons and activities students need to improve their writing skills. The product also delivers a 
5

set of eLearning tools students can use to practice their creative and process writing skills and submit assignments to their teacher online. Writing A-Z supports educators in teaching early emergent writers critical writing fundamentals, and more established writers the processes and skills they need to become college and career ready. 
Vocabulary A-Z™ is an online resource that helps educators easily incorporate vocabulary into day-to-day instruction. The web site offers hundreds of resources and contains over 15,000 student-centric words to help make teaching vocabulary in the classroom effective, easy, and fun. Teachers can quickly create their own custom word lists with auto-generated five-day lesson plans and assessments or can choose from a collection of pre-made lists and lessons that include standards-based academic vocabulary, Dolch sight words, Marzano word lists, and high-frequency words. Lessons are designed to teach words based on context and meaning, not memorization, and support an array of subject-based units in grades K-6.
ReadyTest A-Z is an online resource that prepares students for success on high-stakes English Language Arts assessments.

ExploreLearning Segment
ExploreLearning makes online solutions that help students succeed in math and science. ExploreLearning combines research-proven instructional methods with innovative technology to create new pathways for learning. Founded in 1999, ExploreLearning solutions are now used in every U.S. state and over 50 countries worldwide. ExploreLearning offers two products that supplement core instruction in the classroom: Gizmos for grades 3-12 and Reflex for grades 2-8. Gizmos is a library of over 400 inquiry-based math and science simulations that help students make connections and draw conclusions through interaction, visualization and what-if exploration. Reflex is a highly-effective, game-based math fact fluency system that helps students of all ability levels succeed by continually adapting to students’ instructional needs and providing motivational rewards for their effort. 
ExploreLearning Solutions
Gizmos brings the power of inquiry—and STEM-based learning—to teachers and students in grades 3-12. Gizmos helps teachers take advantage of research-proven instructional strategies and enables students of all ability levels to develop conceptual understanding in math and science. With more than 400 Gizmos at their disposal, teachers can supplement and enhance instruction with interactive visualizations of mathematics and science concepts. Students can manipulate key variables, generate and test hypotheses, and engage in extensive “what-if” experimentation. Gizmos are designed to promote exploration, experimentation, and discovery in math and science. Unlike other products, most Gizmos are open-ended, which means students are free to manipulate variables, run experiments, and look for patterns. The lesson materials provided with Gizmos are customizable and follow a “structured inquiry” approach, with the goal of allowing students to figure out relationships on their own—students become active learners rather than passive recipients of information.
Reflex is an adaptive online solution that helps students in grades 2-8 develop math fact fluency—the quick and effortless (automatic) recall of basic math facts. By enabling students to effortlessly and quickly recall math facts, students free up working memory, enabling them to tackle more complex problems. Traditional methods of teaching math fact fluency, such as worksheets and flash cards, are not effective for many students because these methods are not individualized. They do not adapt to what students know and do not create a customized approach for every child—not to mention, worksheets and flashcards are not motivating and can reduce math to drudgery. Reflex efficiently moves students to fluency by continuously engaging, adapting, and individualizing instruction, thereby creating an optimal experience for every student. The program also provides educators with intuitive and powerful reporting that helps them effectively monitor and support student progress. For students, Reflex utilizes engaging, fast-paced games and rewards them for effort and progress, creating a compelling, motivational environment to support student achievement.
Voyager Sopris Learning Segment
Voyager Sopris Learning is a leading provider of technology, materials, and professional development for educators to ensure all students graduate prepared for college, career, and satisfaction in life after K-12.

6

100% purpose-and data-driven in their delivery.

The Voyager Sopris Learning segment also includes Kurzweil Education brand solutions, which are now fully integrated within the Voyager Sopris Learning management structure. 
Voyager Sopris Learning Solutions
LANGUAGE! Live, authored by renowned literacy expert Louisa Moats, Ed.D., is a comprehensive literacy solution that combines teacher-directed learning with personalized interactive instruction in an online social environment. In light of the more rigorous standards and assessments, the ultimate goal of LANGUAGE! Live is to quickly advance grades 5-12 students to grade-level performance in literacy. It was designed with a carefully scaffolded learning progression intended to meet the high expectations of state standards. Engaging student-directed technology drives instruction and builds foundational skills, while teacher-directed learning hones in on more advanced literacy skills. LANGUAGE! Live takes the best of more than two decades of research and instructional program development to the next level with cutting-edge, next generation online peer collaboration, gamification, and social media.
Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling (LETRS®), authored also by Louisa Moats, Ed.D., is the expertly designed professional development solution for educators who are responsible for teaching and improving PreK-12 instruction in reading, writing, and spelling. Beyond the routines and lesson plans of adopted reading programs, it is important that educators understand the language structures they are teaching, how students learn to read and write, and the reasons some children struggle. LETRS gives teachers this knowledge while addressing each component of reading instruction-phonemic awareness, phonics and word study, oral language, vocabulary, reading fluency and automaticity, comprehension, assessment, and writing. Through LETRS, teachers and reading coaches gain a deeper understanding of language structure and how to help struggling readers. LETRS and the national cadre of expert trainers, all of whom were once educators, help teachers apply best practice in teaching reading in the classroom every day. The LETRS family of products includes Principal’s Primer for Increasing Reading Achievement.
Step Up to Writing®, authored by writing instructional expert Maureen Auman, M.A., is a highly flexible writing program that provides research-based, hands-on, multisensory writing strategies and writing activities that help students become proficient in the areas of informative/explanatory; narrative and personal narrative; and opinion/argument writing. These strategies foster development of critical thinking, reading comprehension, and listening and speaking skills. Step Up to Writing helps establish writing as a process rather than as an end product. Its current edition has been remastered to meet the rigor of the college and career readiness standards, while maintaining the same evidence-proven explicit instruction and workshop approach that has engaged diverse groups of students and improved their writing skills for years. Every Step Up to Writing strategy is built to support specific standards in the areas of writing, language, reading, and speaking and listening.
TransMath®, authored by mathematics expert John Woodward, Ph.D., is a comprehensive, skill-based mathematics intervention program developed specifically for students in grades 5-10 who are two or more years behind in math on standardized grade level tests and lack the necessary skills for successful entry into algebra. The program is an intensive support for the remediation and acceleration of middle and high school students, including students in special education, who are experiencing academic difficulties in the area of math. TransMath’s explicit and systematic instruction addresses students’ gaps in procedural fluency, conceptual understanding, strategic competence, adaptive reasoning, and productive disposition. TransMath’s integrated technology and engaging visual representations support differentiated learning needs.
Vmath®, is a targeted math intervention program for struggling students in grades 2-8 that provides additional opportunities to master critical math concepts and skills. Vmath is specifically designed to reinforce grade-level expectations. Through a balanced, systematic approach, Vmath creates successful learning experiences for students and develops confident, independent learners of mathematics. The Vmath family of products also includes Vmath Summer Adventure, a 2-8 summer school program that shores up summer learning loss in math and VmathLive®, a K-8 motivational online program that provides purposeful math practice.
VelocityTM is a K-5 supplemental literacy intervention and the next generation in adaptive instruction-transforming the classroom and empowering both students and teachers like no other program. Each Velocity student embarks on a learning path that is unique to his or her skills and abilities, meaning no two students will have the same experience. Velocity functions as an extension of the teacher’s presence in the classroom—by continually monitoring each student’s understanding of skills, instantly adjusting lessons to make them more effective for each individual, and then providing actionable insights to the teacher in order to make the most of instructional time. 
Kurzweil 3000 is a reading, writing, and learning software for an array of students who struggle. Widely recognized as one of the most comprehensive and integrated solutions for addressing language and literacy difficulties, Kurzweil 3000 embraces and supports the concept of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) by making print and electronic material available to a broad spectrum of students. Kurzweil 3000 uses a multisensory approach—presenting print or electronic text on the computer screen with added visual and auditory accessibility. It incorporates a host of dynamic features (including powerful 
7

decoding, study skills, and test taking tools) designed to support each individual’s learning style and promote active learning. For students who have difficulty physically accessing curriculum materials, it provides a digital means of engaging with text and supports students who use alternative methods for accessing the computer. Kurzweil 3000 allows students with disabilities to access the regular education curriculum, and the software’s versatility allows school districts to meet a variety of students’ learning needs using just one program—regardless of the grade level or curriculum area.
Other significant Voyager Sopris Learning solutions include the following: DIBELS Next®, a K-6 valid and reliable reading screener that predicts student reading success; Read Well®, a K-3 literacy program that focuses on readability to teach fundamental literacy skills; REWARDS®, a 3-12 supplemental program that provides strategies for reading multisyllabic words; TimeWarp Plus®, a K-8 extended-day and/or summer school program that supplements reading instruction; and LANGUAGE!® The Comprehensive Literacy Curriculum, an intensive intervention for students in grades 4-12 who are substantially below grade-level expectations for literacy. 
Industry Information
The majority of our sales are to public school districts in the United States, although we also sell both domestically and internationally to other types of customers, including private and charter schools, teachers, home school and parent consumers, and other companies that bundle our products with their offerings. Our public school district customers are largely dependent on federal, state, and local funding to purchase our products. While estimates on the total size of the market vary, recent industry reports estimate that the amount that is spent in the United States on instructional materials and services is approximately $8.6 billion, with digital sales now capturing more than half of this amount.
The K-12 education market has been impacted by the adoption of rigorous state standards designed to ensure students obtain the skills and knowledge in their K-12 education careers to graduate high school able to succeed in entry-level, credit-bearing academic college courses and in workforce training programs. Almost all states have moved toward more rigorous standards, adopting either their own state-specific standards or the Common Core State Standards which were designed to establish a single set of clear educational standards throughout the country for grades K-12. We believe schools and districts will augment and replace instructional materials to align to the new standards and to prepare students for assessments measuring progress against the new rigorous standards.
Additionally, a growing market acceptance of and demand for technology-based educational content and delivery is driving a substantial shift in the education market. Schools and districts are demanding more effective solutions, and technology solutions have the potential to increase effectiveness by individualizing and differentiating instruction. 
We believe that demand for our products and professional services will be driven by an increased emphasis on accountability and measurement. There is greater emphasis on evaluating educators based on the performance of their students; regulatory frameworks have mandated stricter accountability, higher standards, and increased transparency in education; and states have been required to measure annual progress towards these standards and make results publicly available. We believe that with more attention to student progress, increased analysis of U.S. student outcomes versus other countries, and movement to adopt more rigorous standards, such as the Common Core State Standards, the number of children deemed to need differentiated products for unique student needs is likely to increase.
We believe our strategic plans are aligned to these market trends.
Competition 
The market for our products is highly competitive and fragmented. Competition varies by segment and product line but typically comes from large publishers covering a broad array of products, smaller providers who specialize in very limited areas, and free or open-source teacher and student resources. Below are examples of competitors by segment.

• | Learning A-Z competitors include Curriculum Associates’ i-Ready, Francisco Partners’ myON, and Renaissance’s Accelerated Reader.


• | ExploreLearning competitors include Scholastic’s FASTT Math, Penda Learning, and PhET.


• | Voyager Sopris Learning competitors include traditional and supplemental curriculum suppliers, including Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Pearson, McGraw-Hill Education, Curriculum Associates, and Lexia, with the Kurzweil Education product lines competing against suppliers such as Don Johnston and TextHelp’s Read+Write.

Seasonality
Our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to a number of factors, including the academic school year, school procurement policies, funding cycles, new products and the amount and timing of spending patterns. Our first quarter historically represents less than 15% of Bookings, which tend to build through the second quarter and peak during the third quarter, since school districts complete most of their purchases around the start of a new school year.
Product Development, Marketing, and Sales
We are strategically focused on ensuring that our product offerings are the most effective at helping students reach their full potential, and that our sales and marketing forces can effectively and efficiently deliver our educational solutions. Each segment has its own development, marketing, and sales teams to better address the unique market position and target customer of its products.
Product Development
We seek to take advantage of new product and technology opportunities and view product development to be essential to maintaining and growing our market position. Product development expenditures may be incurred to incorporate the latest research or pedagogy, bring images current, or update factual content, or to develop variations, expansions (e.g., more grade levels) or other enhancements of our products. We are focusing our development efforts on technology-enabled subscription solutions and expect sales of our purely print-based products to continue to decline. Our online subscription products are enhanced continuously. 
Changing educational standards also provide opportunities to meet new market needs. The continued implementation of these standards is likely to result in an increase in the number of students that are deemed to be below grade level proficiency. Products that are aligned with the Common Core or other rigorous state standards will allow educators to focus on areas where students are not proficient as each lesson will be clearly tied to the required learning objectives. 
Research and development expense, net of capitalization, was $13.7 million and $12.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We capitalize product development costs associated with internal-use software, which includes software as a service offered to our customers with an online subscription, as well as certain pre-publication, production, and online curriculum development expenditures. Capitalized product development costs were as follows by segment in 2017:

• | Learning A-Z – $7.6 million


• | ExploreLearning – $3.0 million


• | Voyager Sopris Learning – $4.8 million

Sales and Marketing 
Our sales force includes both field sales producers, who generally cover districts with larger student enrollment, and an inside sales force, which generally covers smaller territories. Our sales representatives are supported by product or subject matter and implementation experts as well as a marketing team. All of our segments, and Learning A-Z in particular, are increasingly making use of e-commerce and the Internet to sell our products. We have and will continue to participate in state adoptions and requests for proposals when our products meet the needs of these procurement initiatives. As of December 31, 2017, our total combined company sales force employees consisted of 65 field and 73 inside sales representatives for a total of 138 direct sales producers, excluding sales management and marketing. We often use resellers for international sales and also use a small number of independent sales representatives. Sales and marketing expense was $49.5 million and $47.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Concentration Risk 
We are not overly dependent upon any one customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. We have a broad customer base; in the two years ended December 31, 2017, on a consolidated basis, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total net revenues in any one year. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 7% of our total net revenues in 2017. 
Governmental Regulations 
Our operations are governed by laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection for education and student information, equal employment opportunity, workplace safety, information privacy, and worker health, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations under that Act. Additionally, as a company that often bids on various state, local and federally funded programs, we are subject to various governmental procurement policies and regulations. We believe 
9

that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations and we believe that future compliance will not have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated operations or financial condition.
