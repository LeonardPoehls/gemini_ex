Our Corporate History 
 China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. was founded as an unincorporated business on September 1, 2005, under the name TJS Wood Flooring, Inc., and became a C corporation in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. On April 29, 2008, we changed our name to China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. in response to a reverse acquisition transaction with BVI-ACM described below.
 On April 29, 2008, we completed a reverse acquisition transaction with BVI-ACM whereby we issued to the stockholders of BVI-ACM 8,809,583 shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of BVI-ACM. BVI-ACM thereby became our wholly owned subsidiary and the former stockholders of BVI-ACM became our controlling stockholders.
 On August 1, 2013, we consummated a reincorporation merger pursuant to which we merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc., a newly formed Nevada corporation and the surviving entity in the merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into as of August 1, 2013. As a result of the reincorporation the Company is now governed by the laws of the state of Nevada. 
 Background and History of BVI-ACM and China-ACMH 
 BVI-ACM was established on October 9, 2007, under the laws of British Virgin Islands. The majority shareholders of BVI-ACM are Chinese citizens who own 100% of Xin Ao, a limited liability company formed under laws of China. BVI-ACM was established as a special purpose vehicle for foreign fund raising for Xin Ao. China State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, requires the owners of any Chinese companies to obtain SAFEs approval before establishing any offshore holding company structure for foreign financing as well as subsequent acquisition matters. On September 29, 2007, BVI-ACM was approved by local Chinese SAFE as a special purpose vehicle offshore company.
 7 

On November 23, 2007, BVI-ACM established a subsidiary, China-ACMH, in China as a wholly owned foreign limited liability company with registered capital of $5 million. Through China-ACMH and its variable interest entity Xin Ao, we are engaged in producing general ready-mixed concrete, customized mechanical refining concrete, and some other concrete-related products which are mainly sold in China. On September 20, 2010, China ACM established a 100% owned subsidiary, Advanced Investment Holdings Co., Inc., or AIH, in the State of Nevada. AIH never engaged in operations and the Company subsequently dissolved AIH on August 30, 2011.
 In March and April 2010, Xin Ao established five 100% owned subsidiaries in China: Beijing Heng Yuan ZhengKe Technical Consulting Co., Ltd (Heng Yuan ZhengKe), Beijing Hong Sheng An Construction Materials Co., Ltd (Hong Sheng An), Beijing Heng Tai Hong Sheng Construction Materials Co., Ltd (Heng Tai), Da Tong Ao Hang Wei Ye Machinery and Equipment Rental Co., Ltd (Da Tong) and Luan Xian HengXin Technology Co., Ltd (Luan Xian HengXin). Total registered capital for these five subsidiaries was approximately $2.1 million (RMB 14 million) and none of these Xin Ao subsidiaries had actual operation. The Company decided to dissolve these entities between March 2016 and June 2016. As of June 30, 2017, all of these entities have been dissolved. 
 Our Business
Our concrete sales business is comprised of the formulation, production and delivery of the Companys line of C10-C100 concrete mixtures primarily through our current fixed plant, a ready mix concrete batching plant in Beijing. The ready-mixed concrete sales business engages principally in the formulation, preparation and delivery of ready-mixed concrete to the worksites of our customers. For this segment of our business, we procure raw materials, mix them according to our measured mixing formula, ship the final products in mounted transit mixers to the destination work site, and, for more sophisticated structures, pump the mixture and set it into structural frame molds as per structural design parameters. The process of delivering and setting the ready mix concrete mixture cannot exceed 90 minutes because the chemistry of concrete mixture hardens thereafter. The deliverable radius of a concrete mixture from our ready mix plant in Beijing is approximately 25 kilometers. Traffic conditions would affect the timing and shipment of our concrete mixtures. Since the 2008 Olympics, there are alternating license plate traffic restrictions on many traffic routes in Beijing to ease traffic congestion and associated exhaust pollution. Due to the large amounts of working capital required for the acquisition of raw materials associated for this business segment, a supply shortage or degradation of supplier accounts payable credit terms would pose a potential risk to our business.
 Our principal market, Beijing, has enjoyed stronger economic growth and a higher demand for construction than other regions of China. As a result, we believe that competitors will try to expand their sales and build up their distribution networks in our principal market. We anticipate that this trend will continue and likely accelerate. Increased competition may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operation results.
 Our Industry
Our Industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent periods. The concrete products industry experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth since September 2011. In 2014, the slowdown in the industry became more obvious month by month, with profit generally being squeezed by the greater pressure to maintain stable level of production and operation. 
 Chinas average annual GDP growth remained approximately 10% over the past 31 years. China has become the worlds second largest economy, both in nominal GDP and Purchasing Power Parity terms, after the United States. In line with this macroeconomic growth, the Chinese construction and building material industry has grown tremendously. 
 China is already among the worlds largest construction materials producers, ranking first in the worlds annual output of cement, flat glass, building ceramic and ceramic sanitary ware. The construction materials market includes all manufacturers of sand, gravel, aggregates, cement, concrete and bricks. The market does not include other finished or semi-finished building materials.

Construction Demand in China 
 According to the Summary of Construction Outlook in China (the Summary), published in August 6, 2013 by the Freedonia Group, an industry research firm, construction expenditures in China are expected to increase 8.5 percent per year in real terms through 2017. Ongoing urbanization and industrialization, rising income levels, further population and household growth, and the governments continuing efforts to expand and upgrade physical infrastructure in the country will support healthy growth in construction spending.
 Construction expenditures in China are nearly equally split among residential buildings, nonresidential buildings, and nonbuilding structures. Nonbuilding construction will experience the fastest growth (in real terms) through 2017. The increases will benefit from stated efforts to expand and upgrade the countrys transportation infrastructure, such as highways network, subway systems in major cities, and several airports. Utilities construction will also contribute to the expenditures on nonbuilding construction, particularly in rapidly growing urban areas, as the government continues to expand and improve access to such infrastructure like water supply, sewage treatment, rubbish disposal, and gas distribution. Further efforts to increase the countrys power generation capacity and improve electricity transmission networks will also drive spending on nonbuilding construction. 
 Chinas Cement & Concrete Demand 
 Demand for cement in China will be driven by rising, but decelerating, construction expenditures in China. Further advances in cement manufacturing technology are also expected to stimulate sales by improving the quality of the product, stressing the versatility of certain types of cement with excellent performance and/or price benefits over other types of cement across a range of construction applications. Regional cement markets reflect differences in construction expenditures, which in turn are driven by local trends in demographics, industrial output and economic activity. The cement markets in Northwest and Southwest China are expected to grow at a faster pace, as a result of the governments Great Western Development strategy, which aims to promote investment in these areas. Consumption of cement in Central and Northern China is also expected to exceed the national average, supported by high levels of transportation infrastructure construction and booming urban markets in Beijing and Tianjin. (Summary of the Freedonia Group's January 2009 "Cement in China" report from Business Wire). 
 Residential and non-residential buildings in China are increasingly requiring much more concrete due to, among other reasons, the short supply of wood. China is currently the largest consumption market of cement worldwide at over $200 billion annually. At the present rate, it is presumed that China will continue to be an important player in the global construction materials market for at least the next two decades.
 Demand for Ready-Mixed Concrete 
 Construction contractors are expected to continuously represent the largest market for cement. Economic downturns or reductions in government funding of infrastructure projects could significantly reduce our revenues. However, we believe that the ready-mix concrete market exhibits the strongest growth in the cement industry. Revenues are expected to be received from government regulations banning on-site concrete and mortar mixing. Demand for cement used in concrete products is expected to be driven by the increasing popularity of precast concrete with many construction contractors. In addition, the phase-out of clay bricks will heighten demand for concrete blocks. Recognizing the significant environmental impact created from the large-scale construction activities undertaken in the past few decades, Chinas government implemented Decree #341 in 2004 which bans onsite concrete production in over 200 major cities across China in order to reduce environmental damage from onsite cement mixing and improve the quality of concrete used in construction.
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 Ready-mixed concrete is a highly versatile construction material that results from combining coarse and fine aggregates, such as gravel, crushed stone and sand, with water, various chemical admixtures and cement. We manufacture ready-mixed concrete in variations, which in each instance may reflect a specific design use. We generally maintain inventory of raw materials for a short period of time to coordinate our daily materials purchases with the time-sensitive delivery requirements of our customers. 
 9 

The quality of ready-mixed concrete is time-sensitive as it becomes difficult to place within hours after mixing. Consequently, the market for a permanently installed ready-mixed concrete plant is usually limited to an area within certain radius of such plants location. We produce ready-mixed concrete in batches at our plant and use mixer and other trucks to complete the production process, then distribute and deliver the concrete to the worksites of our customers. 
 Concrete has many attributes that make it a highly versatile construction material. In recent years, industry participants have developed various uses for concrete products. 
 We generally obtain contracts through local sales and marketing efforts directed at concrete subcontractors, general contractors, property owners and developers, governmental agencies and home builders.
 Our competitors includes a number of state-owned and large private PRC-based manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, technological innovation and price. Essentially all contracts on which we bid are awarded through a competitive bid process with awards often made to the lowest bidder, though other factors such as shorter completion time or prior experiences are often just as important. Within our markets, we compete with many national, regional and local state-owned and private construction corporations, some of which have achieved greater market penetration or have greater financial and other resources than us. In addition, there are a number of large national companies in our industry that could potentially enter into our markets and compete with us. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits would be reduced.
 We believe that the following competitive strengths enable us to compete effectively and to capitalize on the remaining market for construction materials in China:
  Large Scale Contractor Relationships. We have contracts with major construction contractors which are constructing key infrastructure, commercial and residential projects. Our sales efforts focus on large-scale projects and large customers which place large recurring orders and raise less credit risk to us. For the year ended June 30, 2017, five customers accounted for approximately 40% of the Companys sales and 28% of the Companys account receivables as of June 30, 2017. Should we lose these customers in the future and are unable to obtain additional customers, our revenues will suffer.
  Experienced Management. The technical knowledge and business relationships of our management give us the ability to secure major infrastructure projects, increase production volumes, and implement quality standards and environmentally sensitive policies, and it also provide us with leverage to acquire less sophisticated operators. If there is any significant turnover in our management, we would lose the institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team.
  Innovation Efforts. We strive to produce the most technically and scientifically advanced products for our customers hence we maintain close relationships with Tsinghua University, Xian University of Architecture and Technology and Beijing Dongfang Jianyu Institute of Concrete Science &Technology, which assist us with our research and development activities. During our five year agreement with the Institute, we obtain an advantageous status over many of our competitors by gaining access to a wide array of resources and knowledge. The Company incurred research & development expenses of approximately $0.8 million and $0.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Our Growth Strategy 
 We are committed to enhancing profitability and cash flows through the following strategies:
  Focusing on High Capacity Utilization. We intend to focus on achieving high capacity utilization in order to efficiently operate our plant, by increasing capacity utilization at existing plant or expanding capacity by building new plants to meet existing contracts and anticipated increase in demand. We were focused on our capacity utilization at our Beijing-based concrete plant in fiscal year 2016 and 2017. As a result, we terminated our leased station based on slowing demand for railway construction and the suspension of new and ongoing high speed railway projects stemming from a changing policy announced by Chinas Ministry of Rail and national development and reform commission. 
 10 

 Mergers and Acquisitions. When capital permits, we intend to capitalize on the challenges that smaller companies are encountering in our industry by acquiring complementary companies at favorable prices. We believe that buying rather than building capacity is an option that may be attractive to us if replacement costs are higher than purchase prices. We continue to look into acquiring smaller concrete manufacturers in China as part of our expansion plans. We have not identified specified targets or entered into any Letters-of-Intent at this time. 
  Vertical Integration. When capital permits, we plan to acquire smaller companies within the construction industry, develop more material recycling centers, and hire additional highly qualified employees. In order to accomplish this, we may need to offer additional equity or debt securities. Certain companies we seek to acquire are suppliers of the raw materials we purchase to manufacture our products. If we do acquire such companies we will have greater control over our raw material costs.
  Supply Chain Efficiencies and Scale. We intend to streamline our supply chain process and leverage our scale. 
  New Product Offering. We plan to produce a lightweight aggregate concrete for use in projects and to expand product offerings to include pre-cast concrete.
 Our Operations 
 We provide materials through our ready-mixed concrete plant in Beijing. We own one concrete plant and its related equipment.
 Products 
 As architectural designs become more complex, challenging, and modern in scope, the need for technology driven companies to provide high-end specialty concrete mixtures has rapidly accelerated. Increasing demand for state-of-the-art cement mixtures has spurred our technological innovation and our ability to provide advanced mixtures of building materials that meet project specific engineering and environmental specifications. We produce a range of C10 to C100 concrete materials and specialize in an array of specialized ready-mixed concretes tailored to each projects technical specifications and environmental standards. 
 We specialize in ready-mixed concrete, a concrete mixture made at our facility with complete computerized operating systems. Such concrete accounts for nearly three-fourths of all concrete produced. Ready-mixed concrete is mixed on demand and is shipped to worksites by concrete mixer trucks.
 Our ready-mixed concrete products consist of proportioned mixes we prepare and deliver in an unhardened plastic state for placement and shaping into designed forms at the worksite. Selecting the optimum mix for a worksite entails determining not only the ingredients with the desired permeability, strength, appearance and other properties after it hardened, but also the ingredients necessary to achieve a workable consistency considering the weather and other conditions at the worksite. We believe we can achieve product differentiation for the mixes we offer because of the variety of mixes we produce, our volume production capacity and our scheduling, delivery and placement reliability.
 We produce ready-mixed concrete by combining the desired type of cement, other cementitious materials and gravel and crushed stone with water and, typically, one or more admixtures. These admixtures, such as chemicals, minerals and fibers, determine the usefulness of the product for particular applications. 
 We use a variety of chemical admixtures to relieve internal pressure, increase resistance to crack in subfreezing weather, retard the hardening process to make concrete more workable in hot weather, strengthen concrete by reducing its water content, accelerate the hardening process, reduce the time required for curing, and facilitate the placement of concrete acquiring low water content. 
 11 

We frequently use various mineral admixtures as supplements to cement, which we refer to as cementitious materials, to alter the permeability, strength and other properties of concrete. 
 The ready-mixed concrete sector in the market is growing at a fast rate, largely due to the Chinese governments implementation of Decree #341 in 2004. This law bans on-site concrete production in over 200 cities across China, with the goal of reducing environmental damages from onsite concrete mixing and improving the quality of concrete used in construction. The use of ready-mix concrete minimizes worksite noise, dirt and congestion, and most additives used in ready-mix concrete are environmentally safe. Our goal is to continue the use of at least 30% recyclable components in our concrete mixtures.
 We are building a comprehensive product portfolio that serves the diverse needs of our developing customer base and all unique construction and infrastructure projects. While we mainly specialize in ready-mix concrete formulations from controlled low-strength material to high-strength concrete, each of them are specifically formulated to meet the needs of each project. We provide both industry standard and highly innovative products, including:
 
Common Industry Mixtures | Industry Leading Mixtures 
----------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------
(Customized to Project) | Highly Technical Blends 
Ready-mixed Concrete Blends: C10 to C100 | Compound Admixture Concrete 
Controlled Low-Strength Material (CLSM) | Lightweight Aggregate Concrete 
High-Strength Concrete with Customized Fibers | Energy-saving Phase change thermostat concrete
Soil Cement, Unique Foundation Concrete | C100 High Performance Concrete 

Our Customers 
 For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we had one customer, whose sales accounted for more than 10% of our total sales. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we had no customer, whose sales accounted for more than 10% of our total sales. Five customers accounted for approximately 40% and 30% of the Companys sales for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The total accounts receivable from these customers amounted to approximately $18.9 million and $13.5 million as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Developing New Relationships
 Our business will be damaged if project contracts with the Chinese government, for which we may act as a sub-contractor, are cancelled. Our sales strategy balances these risks by focusing on building new long-term cooperative relationships with some of Chinas top construction companies in order to enhance our reputation and to enter new markets. Our sales representatives are actively building relationships with the Chinese government, general contractors, architects, engineers, and other potential sources of new business in target markets. Our sales efforts are further supported by our executive officers and engineering personnel, who have substantial experience in the design, formulation and implementation of advanced construction and concrete materials projects.
 Our Suppliers
We rely on third party suppliers of the raw materials to manufacture our products. Our top five suppliers accounted for approximately 48% and 28% of the Companys purchases for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The total accounts payable to these suppliers amounted to approximately $4.5 million and $8.5 million as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Sales and Marketing 
 General contractors typically select their suppliers of ready-mixed concrete and precast concrete. In large, complex projects, an engineering firm or division within a state transportation or public works department, may influence the purchasing decision, particularly if the concrete has complicated design specifications. In connection with large, complex projects and government-funded projects, the general contractor or project engineer usually awards supply orders on the basis of either direct negotiation or a competitive bidding process. Our marketing efforts target on general contractors, developers, design engineers, architects and homebuilders whose focus extends beyond the price of our product to quality, consistency and reducing the in-place cost. 
 12 

Our marketing efforts are geared toward advancing China-ACMH as the supplier to build Chinas most modern and challenging projects. The Company is constantly seeking ways to raise its profile and leverage additional publicity. To this end, the Company plans to expand its presence at leading construction industry events and in periodicals to build up successful reputation. The primary goal is to reinforce the sales efforts by promoting positive testimonials and successful stories from the Companys high profile clients and projects. Our marketing and sales strategy emphasizes on the sale of value-added products and solutions to customers.
 Research and Development 
 Construction materials companies are under extreme pressure to respond quickly to industrial demands with new designs and product innovations that support rapidly changing technical demand and regulatory requirements. We devote a substantial amount of attention to the research and development of advanced construction materials that meet the specific needs of projects while striving to lead the industry in value, materials and processes. We have sophisticated in-house R&D and testing facilities, a highly technical onsite team, in cooperation with a leading research institution, experienced management and advisory experts. Our research and development expense was approximately $0.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $0.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.
University Relationships & Cooperation Agreements 
 We have strong relationships with Tsinghua University and the Xian University of Architecture and Technology. We signed a ten-year cooperation agreement with Xian University, a top university in the fields of building and material science research and education, on June 10, 2007, so as to keep pace with the global advancements of the cement and concrete industries. 
Beijing Concrete Institute Partnership 
 The Beijing Dongfang Jianyu Institute of Concrete Science & Technology, or Beijing Concrete Institute, has 40 employees, with five senior research fellows, and 15 mid-level researchers. The Institute and its staff have frequently participated and collaborated with national and local government agencies to establish the following industry standards:

 In addition, we collaborate closely with the institute and its executives who play a strong role in recommending industry standards, advising on major infrastructure developments, and creating and maintaining strong connections with leading developers, construction companies, and governmental officials. 
 Successful Innovations
Some of our advanced products and processes are developed through our relationships with research institutes and universities, including:
 C100 High Performance Concrete 
 High Strength Concrete is often defined as concrete with a compressive strength greater than 6000 psi (41 MPa). The primary difference between high-strength concrete and normal-strength concrete is the compressive strength that represent the maximum resistance of a concrete sample to applied pressure. Manufacturing high-strength concrete involves making optimal use of the basic ingredients that constitute normal-strength concrete.
 Through our collaborative efforts, we have developed a high performance concrete which can be produced at an impermeable grade above P35, and can be used as self-waterproofing concrete for structural engineering, as the water-cement (W/C) ratio and carbonized shrinking is minimal and the structure is close-grained.
 Only a limited number of corporations in the Beijing are equipped with the expertise to produce C100 High Performance Concrete. 
 14 

Compound Admixture Concrete 
 This compound mineral mixture is a composite of coal powder, mineral powder and mineral activators blended to specific proportions. This mixture improves activity, filling, and super-additive effects of the concrete and also improves the compatibility between cement and aggregate.
Lightweight Aggregate Concrete & Innovative Pumping Technology 
 This procedure involves a pumping technology of lightweight aggregate. It is a pretreatment method of lightweight aggregate. Setting appropriate times and pressure, lightweight aggregate will reach an appropriate saturation state under pressure once it is put into a custom designed sealed pressure vessel. Lightweight aggregate concrete was prepared through the above pretreatment method, and would dry quicker under pumping pressure without losing consistency. Accordingly, lightweight aggregate concrete will be easily pumped when applied which shorten the construction time.
Energy-saving Technologies of Phase Change Thermostat Concrete 
 Energy conservation concrete may adjust and reflect process temperature, which would solve cracking problem brought about by cement heat of hydration in large-scale concrete pours.
 Polycarboxylate Series High Performance Water Reducing Agent Compositing Technique 
 The research and production of water reducing admixture would improve performance while lowering pollution and environmental impact. Super plasticizer Polycarboxylate series which reduces water requirements is an attractive additive in that it enables high strength concrete, super-strength concrete, high fluidity and super plasticizer concrete, and self-defense concrete. The water reduction of Polycarboxylate may reach 20% to 25%, higher than the current industry standard -- the Naphthaline water reducing agent. The cost of the water reducing agent is highly competitive, as it may replace Naphthaline to be used for high strength and high performance concrete production.
Application of Reused Water in Concrete 
 The re-use of waste water of a concrete plant to mix concrete is significant as it can reduce production costs, minimize fresh water usage and introduce an efficient approach to address industrial waste. The practical application of this effort is a further step towards the goal of minimal pollution and emissions.
Our Competition 
 Our principal market, Beijing, has enjoyed stronger economic growth and a higher demand for construction than other regions of China. As a result, we believe that competitors will try to expand their sales and build up their distribution networks in Beijing. Our future success depends on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace.
 We compete primarily on the basis of quality, technological innovation and price. Our main competitors include Beijing Construction Engineering Group, BBMG Group Co., LTD, Beijing Uni-Construction Group., Jidong Concrete Group,. 
 Essentially all of the contracts we bid on are awarded through a competitive bid process with awards generally made to the lowest bidder, though other factors such as shorter completion time or prior experiences are often just as important. Within our markets, we compete with many national, regional and local construction corporations. Some of these competitors have achieved greater market penetration or have greater financial and other resources than us. In addition, we compete with a number of state-owned enterprises, which have significantly greater financial resources and competitive advantage than us.
 There are approximately140 concrete mixture stations in the Beijing area. The concrete production industry is highly segmented, with no single supplier having greater than a 10% market share.

Level II companies are licensed to produce concrete of all strength levels as well as special concretes, and Level III producers are licensed to produce concrete with strength level C60 and below. We are currently a Level II concrete producer.
 Additionally, to make improvements at our currently existing plant, we do not need to apply for regulatory approval. However, in order to build new concrete plants, we need to (i) apply for a business license from the local Administration of Industry and Commerce, (ii) receive environmental approval from the local Environmental Protection Bureau in the relevant district area, and (iii) apply for an Industry Qualification Certificate from the local Municipal Construction Committee. The time estimated to receive each of these approvals is approximately one month. In the past, we have not been rejected by any of these three regulators for approval.
