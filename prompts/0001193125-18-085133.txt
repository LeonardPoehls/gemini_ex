--------+----------

Company Overview 
 We are a financial holding company headquartered in Franklin, Tennessee. Through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, Franklin Synergy Bank, a Tennessee-chartered commercial bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, we provide a full range of banking and related financial services with a focus on service to small businesses, corporate entities, local governments and individuals. We operate through 13 branches and one loan production office in the demographically attractive and growing Williamson, Rutherford and Davidson Counties within the Nashville metropolitan area. As used in this report, unless the context otherwise indicates, any reference to Franklin Financial, our company, the company, us, we and our refers to Franklin Financial Network, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries (including Franklin Synergy Bank), any reference to FFN refers to Franklin Financial Network, Inc. only and any reference to Franklin Synergy or the Bank refers to our banking subsidiary, Franklin Synergy Bank. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had consolidated total assets of $3.8 billion, total loans, including loans held for sale, of $2.3 billion, total deposits of $3.2 billion and total equity of $304.7 million. 
 Our principal executive office is located at 722 Columbia Avenue, Franklin, Tennessee 37064-2828, and our telephone number is (615) 236-2265. Our website is www.franklinsynergybank.com. The information contained on or accessible from our website does not constitute a part of this report and is not incorporated by reference herein. 
 Our History and Growth 
 We were formed as a Tennessee corporation in April 2007 and commenced banking operations through the newly-formed Franklin Synergy Bank in November 2007. We were established with the initial objective of building a locally-managed commercial bank to service the needs of Franklin, Tennessee and the greater Williamson County area. Our mission statement is to build a legacy company by creating shareholder value, cultivating strong customer relationships and fostering an extraordinary team of directors, officers and employees. We were formed by a core management team of veteran bankers based in Middle Tennessee led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard Herrington. Many of our founders built Franklin Financial Corporation (which is not directly affiliated with our company), which was founded in 1988, and grew the newly-formed real estate-oriented bank to nine branches and $785 million in assets as of June 30, 2002, before announcing the sale of the bank to Fifth Third Bancorp, Inc. in July 2002. Mr. Herrington and certain members of this management team subsequently joined Cumberland Bancorp, Inc. (later renamed Civitas BankGroup, Inc.), a troubled Tennessee-based bank holding company, in December 2002, to lead its restructuring. The team led a dramatic improvement of Cumberlands asset quality and profitability, by decreasing nonperforming loans to total loans from 2.25% in 2003 to 0.31% in 2006 and growing net income from $1.1 million in 2003 to $6.7 million in 2006, before it was acquired by Greene County Bancshares, Inc. in May 2007. 
 On July 1, 2014, we completed our acquisition of MidSouth Bank (MidSouth) which enabled us to increase our footprint in Middle Tennessee and in the Nashville metropolitan area, specifically in the attractive Rutherford County market. The acquisition also diversified our revenue mix by expanding our retail customer base and increasing our capacity to provide wealth management services, including trust powers which we believe is a competitive advantage to drive new relationships with higher income customers. 
 FFN and the Bank entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Bank Merger with Civic Bank & Trust (Civic), a Tennessee banking corporation, on December 14, 2015, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto, dated May 9, 2016, Amendment No. 2 thereto, dated March 30, 2017, and Amendment No. 3 thereto, dated September 29, 2017, pursuant to which Civic will merge with and into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving Tennessee banking corporation. We received the approval of the TDFI on April 13, 2016 and approval from the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) on December 28, 2017. The proposed merger has been approved by each companys Board of Directors, and is subject to approval by Civics shareholders. Civic has called a special meeting of shareholders to be held on March 30, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time for approval of the merger. 
 Our Market 
 We operate 13 branches in Williamson and Rutherford Counties and one loan production office within the Nashville metropolitan area. Our markets are among the most attractive, both in Tennessee, and the Southeast, and compare favorably to some of the more well-known and higher-profile markets in the U.S., although our markets are not dependent on commodity pricing. We believe that our focus on, and success in, growing market share in Williamson and Rutherford Counties will enhance our long-term value and profitability compared to financial institutions of our size in other regions of the country. The markets in which we operate are characterized by strong demographics including high incomes, increasing population, a growing workforce and unemployment that tends to be below the national rate.

Our Business Strategy 
 We consider ourselves to be bankers, not just lenders. Our core business strategy is to provide our banking customers with a full suite of financial services by cultivating strong long-term customer relationships and by developing an extraordinary team of officers and employees focused on the customer experience. We are focused on providing convenience and personal service to our customers that is superior to that of the out-of-state super-regional and national financial institutions operating in our markets, while simultaneously managing risk and profitability by remaining selective when expanding our customer base and making loans. We also prioritize our clients financial security and privacy and assist the communities in which we do business through socially responsible leadership. Our unique culture is a cornerstone to our business and has resulted in substantial but stable growth and profitability. 
 By continuing to offer several value-added products and services within our core areas of strength, such as mortgage lending and wealth management, to invest in technology to improve our systems and the customer experience, and to leverage strong relationships with consumers, professionals, local governments and businesses within our community, we believe we can gain greater market share, which will improve our operational efficiency and increase profitability. As evidence of the success of our strategy, our deposit market share in Williamson County has increased from 3.4% in 2009 to a market-leading deposit share of approximately 25.3% per the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporations (FDICs) Summary of Deposits report as of June 30, 2017, despite the presence of more institutions competing for deposits. The Companys deposit market share in Rutherford County has grown to 12.2%, which is the second-most deposit share in the Rutherford County market. 
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that we have a unique operating culture that differentiates us from our competitors and enables us to organically grow our business and enhance shareholder value. This unique operating culture includes: 

 | a commitment to provide superior and personal service to our customers, both through our employees and via our continued investment in cutting edge technologies in areas of deposit taking, loan origination and risk management;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a focus on building long-term relationships with our customers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | community leadership, as we look to engage with local civic, professional and charitable organizations and exhort our employees to do so as well.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our culture forms the basis for our competitive strengths, which we believe allow us to leverage our market opportunity and grow our business profitability. In particular, we believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and provide a strong foundation from which to deliver growth and profitability, all while enhancing shareholder value: 
 Well Positioned in Attractive Markets 
 We believe that we are well positioned to grow our business profitably in the demographically attractive and growing markets within the Nashville metropolitan area in which we operate. We believe that our target market segments, small to medium size for profit businesses and the consumer base working or living in and near our geographical footprint, demand the convenience and personal service that a smaller, independent financial institution such as we can offer. We believe the heavy out-of-state banking presence (out-of-state super-regional and national financial institutions control approximately 53.6% of local deposits in the Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro-Franklin metropolitan statistical area (the Nashville MSA) as of June 30, 2017) provides an opportunity for a strong local bank like us to add greater market share from customers who are looking for more personal banking services and a more customer-friendly experience. Through our efforts to expand our deposit base, we currently have the largest market share of deposits in Williamson County. 
Experienced Management Team 
 We have an experienced management team with a history of working together in our target markets and a track record of delivering growth and shareholder value. Many members of our executive leadership team have been with us since inception and many have worked together at previous banks, including both large financial institutions and community banks. Our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Mortgage Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investment Officer and Chief Credit Officer have worked in our local market for a number of years and have experienced a variety of economic cycles. This deep local experience has given us the ability to understand and react to market changes and maintain strong profitability and growth without sacrificing asset quality. 
 Our management team has a proven track record of delivering shareholder value. Richard Herrington co-founded Franklin Financial Corporation (Franklin National Bank) in 1988, where he and his management team grew assets by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.5% from 1995  2002 and positioned the bank to eventually be sold to Fifth Third Bancorp, Inc., which was announced in 2002 and closed in 2004, for 5.4 times tangible book value. According to SNL Financial, this multiple represents 
 
3 
 
 the 9th highest price to book multiple for all bank transactions announced in the past 20 years where deal value was in excess of $50 million. He then served as Chief Executive Officer at Cumberland Bancorp, Inc. (later renamed Civitas BankGroup, Inc.), where he and his team restructured the bank and significantly bolstered profitability, growing net income by a CAGR of 82% from 2003 2006, before selling the bank to Greene County Bancshares, Inc. in 2007 for 3.0 times tangible book value. 
 The members of our Board of Directors have diverse industry experiences and have deep and long-term ties to the local community. We believe that we have an ideal blend of directors that have been with our management team at previous banks as well as directors that have joined our Board in recent years. 
 Local Real Estate Lending Expertise 
 We are real estate bankers that have focused on Middle Tennessee collateral since 1989. Our in-depth knowledge of the commercial customers, real estate development and credit in Williamson and Rutherford Counties gives us a competitive advantage in loan production, deposit attraction and ancillary revenue generation as we grow market share. Even when the local loan market gets competitive, we do not compromise on pricing and structuring of loan facilities, as our bankers are able to provide customized solutions delivered with a relatively quick turnaround time, as a result of the fact that our underwriting and banking operations occur locally. 
 With our firm principles of lending on Middle Tennessee collateral, our local real estate expertise and our localized delivery apparatus, we are poised to capture greater market share in the demographically-attractive and growing Williamson and Rutherford Counties. 
 Successful Balance of Growth and Profitability 
 We understand the importance of successfully balancing growth and profitability with asset quality to enhance shareholder value. The following highlights the key aspects of our approach to maintaining this balance: 

 | Consistent, Strong and Disciplined Growth. Our approach balances both disciplined growth and profitability. Our community-focused business model has resulted in loan growth with a CAGR of 39% from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2017. Since opening in 2007, we have expanded into the very attractive Rutherford County market, and we have added a loan production office in Davidson County. Additionally, we have increased focus on small business lending and have grown our commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, which represent approximately 22.3% of our portfolio at December 31, 2017, by a CAGR of nearly 64% since 2009. We have grown our deposit market share in Williamson County and are the top local financial institution in the county by deposits with a market share of approximately 25%. Our growth has resulted in improved profitability, as reflected by return on average assets increasing from negative in 2009 to 0.82% for 2017.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Disciplined Credit Risk Management. Our robust approach to risk management has enabled growth of our loan portfolio without compromising credit. Our credit risk management strategy is based on prudent underwriting criteria and local knowledge. Our lending decisions are centralized and committee-focused, with committees meeting multiple times per week. We are collateral lenders, with strong focus on secondary sources of repayment, especially collateral based in Williamson and Rutherford Counties. As a result of the implementation of our risk management strategy, less than 2% of our total loans are unsecured.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that by maintaining our consistent origination and underwriting strategy, we will be able to maintain our consistent growth across shifting market environments. 
 Products and Services 
 The Bank operates as a full-service financial institution for its customers in its expanded market area with a full line of financial products, including: 
 Commercial Banking 
 Traditional commercial banking services are the mainstay of the Bank. The Banks focus is to service small to medium-sized businesses and self-employed professionals. Certain not-for-profit and governmental entities also find the Banks services attractive. 
 The Banks focus in the commercial banking market is to provide high quality service for its customers supported by the latest bank technology. In the credit service area, the Bank endeavors to give its commercial customers access to a highly-trained team of credit and deposit service specialists who remain with the customer relationship for long periods of time. Credit decision-making is customized to meet the borrowers financial needs and designed for rapid response. Credit judgments involve the Banks senior management and, where legally required, involve the directors of the Bank. Government guaranteed lending services such as the Small Business Administration (SBA) may be utilized as needed.

Consumer Banking 
 The Bank offers a broad range of financial services designed to meet the credit, savings, and transactional needs of local consumers. First mortgage real estate loans, home equity loans, and other personal loans are the focus of consumer lending. Consumer depository and transaction needs are met through dual delivery systems of traditional branches and the Internet, including mobile banking. 
Mortgage Loans 
 Our mortgage loan department originates single-family, fixed rate residential mortgage loans that we sell in the secondary market. Construction loans also are available for residential and commercial purposes. 
Deposits 
 The Banks deposit products include demand, interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), municipal deposits, savings, and deposit accounts. CDs offer various maturities ranging from 30 days to five years. The Bank generates relationships by personal contacts within the conventional trading markets for such services by its officers, directors, and employees, who include persons with banking experience in these markets. The Bank also solicits local deposits through the Internet and offers Internet-only deposit accounts to supplement traditional depository accounts. Loan customers are encouraged to bring their deposit business to the Bank, including transaction accounts, CDs, and retirement accounts. This practice further increases the deposit base for the Bank and assists in controlling overall market costs related to deposit acquisition. 
Wealth Management/Trust Services 
 The Bank has the capacity to provide wealth management services, including trust services, as the Bank is authorized to exercise trust powers, which provides the Bank with a competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2017, our wealth management and trust services division managed $359.9 million in assets. 
Other Products and Services 
 In order to meet all financial needs of the customers, the Bank offers retirement planning, financial planning, investment services and insurance products through its financial services department. Some of these products may be outsourced through relationships with other financial institutions. 
Recent Trends 
 From a financial perspective, management believes the Bank has reached key milestones significantly faster than most banks in the United States during their first ten full years of operation. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had $2.3 billion in loans, including loans held for sale; assets of $3.8 billion, $3.2 billion in deposits, $304.7 million of equity, and was number one in deposit market share in Williamson County and number two in deposit market share in Rutherford County based on deposits at June 30, 2017. 
 Management addresses changes in banking over recent years and embarks on new initiatives as appropriate. In the past, banks needed branches on every corner; today that is considered an outdated way of doing business. Many of the Banks customers like to visit with personnel at the Bank, and the Bank will continue to offer a welcoming environment. Other customers prefer to bank online and through mobile channels. The Bank provides a full range of banking products and services designed to attract all types of customers. 
 The Bank continues to enhance banking convenience by offering the option of opening accounts online and through mobile channels (savings accounts, checking accounts and CDs). Customers can access banking services at their convenience. The Banks remote deposit system allows consumers to deposit checks online without the need to come to a branch. Business customers enjoy this convenience as well. 
 Local businesses are important to the Bank. The Bank has many products that can help its corporate customers become more profitable, including sweep accounts, credit card processing, remote capture and automated lock box. A unique offering is workplace banking, which allows employers to offer a special banking benefits package to their employees. The Bank also can meet the borrowing needs of businesses through traditional working capital loans, as well as accounts receivable loans and business expansion loans. One of the Banks specialties is customizing services to the unique needs of the business.

Competition 
 All phases of FFNs and the Banks business are highly competitive. FFN and the Bank are subject to intense competition from various financial institutions and other companies or firms that offer financial services. The Bank competes for deposits with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions and issuers of commercial paper and other securities, such as money-market and mutual funds. In making loans, the Bank competes with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, consumer finance companies, credit unions, leasing companies, and other lenders. Information about specific competition in Williamson County and Rutherford County is included under RISK FACTORSCompetition For Deposits and Loans Is Intense, and No Assurance Can Be Given That We Will Be Successful in Our Efforts to Compete with Other Financial Institutions. 
 While the direction of recent and proposed federal legislation seems to favor increased competition between banks and different types of financial or other institutions for both deposits and loans, it is not possible to forecast the impact such developments may have on commercial banking in general or as to the Bank or FFN in particular. The Bank will continue to compete with these and other financial institutions, many of which have far greater assets and financial resources than the Bank and whose common stock may be more widely traded than that of FFN. See BUSINESSSupervision and Regulation. No assurance can be given that the Bank will be successful in its efforts to compete with such other institutions. 
 Enterprise Risk Management 
 We place significant emphasis on risk mitigation as an integral component of our organizational culture. We believe that our emphasis on risk management is manifested in our solid asset quality statistics and our credit risk management procedures discussed above. 
 We also focus on risk management in numerous other areas throughout our organization, including with respect to asset/liability management, regulatory compliance and internal controls. We have implemented an extensive asset/liability management process aided by simulation models provided by reputable third parties. We engage in ongoing internal audit and review of all areas of our operations and regulatory compliance. 
 We have implemented management assessment and testing of internal controls consistent with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and have engaged an experienced independent public accounting firm to assist us with respect to compliance. 
 Employees 
 Management employs officers who have substantial experience and proven records in the banking industry and proven histories in business and commerce, and pays competitive salaries to attract and retain such persons. It is not anticipated that we will experience any substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining the desired caliber of officers and other employees. We offer a typical health and disability insurance plan to our employees and those of the Bank, as well as a 401(k) Plan and officer equity-based incentive awards. 
 FFN currently has eight directors and the Bank currently has 11 directors, and as of December 31, 2017, we and our bank subsidiary had 279 full-time employees and two part-time employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be excellent. Furthermore, we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements. 
 Trademarks 
 We obtained registrations with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the protection of the trademarks FRANKLIN SYNERGY BANK® and FRANKLIN FINANCIAL NETWORK®. Management does not believe these trademarks are confusingly similar to trademarks used by other institutions in the financial services business and intends to protect the use of these trademarks nationwide. 
Policies and Procedures 
 The Board of Directors of the Bank has established a statement of lending policies and procedures being used by loan officers of the Bank when making loans. Asset quality is of utmost importance and an independent loan review process has been established to monitor the Banks lending function. It is imperative that the Board of Directors and management have an independent and objective evaluation of the quality of specific individual loans and of the overall quality of the total portfolio. 
 The Board of Directors of the Bank also has established an investment policy that guides the Bank officers in determining the investment portfolio of the Bank. Other policies include a code of ethics, audit policy, loan policy, fair lending, compliance, bank secrecy, personnel and information system policies.

Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) evaluates the Banks record of helping to meet the credit needs of its community consistent with safe and sound operations. The Federal Reserve also takes this record into account when deciding on certain applications submitted by the Bank. The Banks assessment area is Williamson County, Rutherford County and Davidson County for business loans, mortgage, and general financial services. 
 The Bank is a fair and equal credit lender. Managements lending objectives are to make credit products available to all segments of the Banks market and community. Williamson County has one moderate census tract, Davidson County has thirty-eight moderate income census tracts and twenty-nine low income tracts, and Rutherford County has seven moderate census tracts and two low census tracts. Products are being developed and marketed to individuals and businesses located in those census tracts. 
 Supervision and Regulation 
 The following summaries of statutes and regulations affecting banks and their holding companies do not purport to be complete. Such summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations described. 
Bank Holding Company Regulation 
 FFN is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the Holding Company Act), and is registered with the Federal Reserve. Banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies are subject to restrictions under federal law, which limit the transfer of funds by the subsidiary banks to their respective holding companies and non-banking subsidiaries, whether in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments or asset purchases. Under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, such transfers by any subsidiary bank to its holding company or any nonbanking subsidiary are limited in amount to 10% of the subsidiary banks capital and surplus and, with respect to FFN and all such non-banking subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of such banks capital and surplus. Banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies are also subject to the provisions of Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with certain affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to such institution or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit are required to be secured in specified amounts. The Holding Company Act also prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, a bank holding company from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting stock of any company engaged in non-banking activities. An exception to this prohibition is for activities expressly found by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto, such as consumer lending and other activities that have been approved by the Federal Reserve by regulation or order. Certain servicing activities are also permissible for a bank holding company if conducted for or on behalf of the bank holding company or any of its affiliates. FFN has elected to be a financial holding company under Regulation Y, allowing FFN to engage in certain financial activities without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. 
 As a bank holding company, FFN is required to file with the Federal Reserve semi-annual reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve may also make examinations of FFN and its non-bank affiliates. 
 According to federal law and Federal Reserve policy, bank holding companies are expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of their subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary. This support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support. Furthermore, in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDICeither as a result of default of a banking or thrift subsidiary of FFN or related to FDIC assistance provided to a subsidiary in danger of defaultthe other banking subsidiaries of FFN may be assessed for the FDICs loss, subject to certain exceptions. 
 Regulation Y generally requires persons acting directly or indirectly or in concert with one or more persons to give the Federal Reserve 60 days advanced written notice before acquiring control of a bank holding company. Under the regulation, control is defined as the ownership or control with the power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. The regulation also provides for a presumption of control if a person owns, controls, or holds with the power to vote 10% or more (but less than 25%) of any class of voting securities. A bank holding company may be limited to ownership of 5% ownership of voting securities. If the person or persons making the acquisition is a company, prior approval from the Federal Reserve may be required. 
 Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval. The payment of dividends by any bank also may be affected by other factors, such as the maintenance of adequate capital for such subsidiary bank. In addition to the foregoing restrictions, the Federal Reserve has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserves view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or that could only be 
 
7 
 
funded in ways that weaken the bank holding companys financial health, such as by borrowing. The Federal Reserve may also order a bank holding company to terminate an activity or control of a non-bank subsidiary if such activity or control constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of a subsidiary bank and is inconsistent with sound banking principles. Furthermore, the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (TDFI) also has authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by a Tennessee bank when it determines such payment to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. 
 A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are also prohibited from acquiring any voting shares of, or interest in, any banks located outside of the state in which the operations of the bank holding companys subsidiaries are located, unless the bank holding company and its subsidiaries are well-capitalized and well managed. 
 In approving acquisitions by holding companies of banks and companies engaged in the banking-related activities described above, the Federal Reserve considers a number of factors, including the expected benefits to the public such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, as weighed against the risks of possible adverse effects such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve is also empowered to differentiate between new activities and activities commenced through the acquisition of a going concern. 
 The Attorney General of the United States may, within 30 days after approval by the Federal Reserve of an acquisition, bring an action challenging such acquisition under the federal antitrust laws, in which case the effectiveness of such approval is stayed pending a final ruling by the courts. Failure of the Attorney General to challenge an acquisition does not, however, exempt the holding company from complying with both state and federal antitrust laws after the acquisition is consummated or immunize the acquisition from future challenge under the anti-monopolization provisions of the Sherman Act. 
 Capital Guidelines 
 The Federal Reserve has issued risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and member banks. Under the guidelines, the minimum ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. To be considered a well capitalized bank or bank holding company under the guidelines, a bank or bank holding company must have a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater. At least half of the total capital is to be comprised of common equity, retained earnings, and a limited amount of perpetual preferred stock, after subtracting goodwill and certain other adjustments (Tier 1 capital). The remainder may consist of perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt securities, a limited amount of subordinated debt, other preferred stock not qualifying for Tier 1 capital, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves (Tier 2 capital). The Bank is subject to similar capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted a minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) of 3% or 4% based on supervisory considerations. Generally, banking organizations are expected to operate well above the minimum required capital level of 3% unless they meet certain specified criteria, including that they have the highest regulatory ratings. Most banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of 3% or 4%, as applicable, plus an additional cushion of at least 1% to 2%. The guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance upon intangible assets. 
 In July 2013, the federal banking regulators, in response to the statutory requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), adopted regulations implementing the Basel Capital Adequacy Accord (Basel III), which had been approved by the Basel member central bank governors in 2010 as an agreement among the countries central banks and bank regulators on the amount of capital banks must hold as a cushion against losses and insolvency. The new minimum capital to risk-weighted assets (RWA) requirements are a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 4.5% and a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6.0%, and a Total Capital ratio of 8.0%. The minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) is 4.0%. The new rule also changes the definition of capital, mainly by adopting stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets, and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the new rule requires that most regulatory capital deductions be made from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. 
 Under the Basel III rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer is measured relative to RWA. Phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirements began on January 1, 2016 and the requirements will be fully phased in on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer threshold for 2017 is 1.25%. A banking organization with a buffer greater than 2.5% once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in would not be subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer of less than 2.5% would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. The rule also prohibits a banking organization from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. Effectively, the Basel III framework will require us to meet minimum capital ratios of (i) 7% for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, (ii) 8.5% Tier 1 Capital, and (iii) 10.5% Total Capital. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is 
 
8 
 
 defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organizations quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. When the new rule is fully phased in, the minimum capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer will exceed the prompt corrective action (PCA) well-capitalized thresholds. 
 Under the new rule, mortgage-servicing assets and deferred tax assets are subject to stricter limitations than those applicable under the current general risk-based capital rule. More specifically, certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, mortgage-servicing assets, and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock are each subject to an individual limit of 10% of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital elements and are subject to an aggregate limit of 15% of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital elements. The amount of these items in excess of the 10% and 15% thresholds are to be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. Amounts of mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets, and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions that are not deducted due to the aforementioned 10% and 15% thresholds must be assigned a 250% risk weight. Finally, the new rule increases the risk weights for past-due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and makes selected other changes in risk weights and credit conversion factors. 
 Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a financial institution could subject a banking institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits, and other restrictions on its business. 
 Tennessee Banking Act; Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
 The Bank is incorporated under the banking laws of the State of Tennessee and, as such, is subject to the applicable provisions of those laws. The Bank is subject to the supervision of the TDFI and to regular examination by that department. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve and therefore is subject to Federal Reserve regulations and policies and is subject to regular exam by the Federal Reserve. The Banks deposits are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund, or DIF, and the Bank is, therefore, subject to the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA). 
 The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system for insured depository institutions that takes into account the risks attributable to different categories and concentrations of assets and liabilities. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC was required to adopt regulations that would base deposit insurance assessments on total assets less capital rather than deposit liabilities and to include off-balance sheet liabilities of institutions and their affiliates in risk-based assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent an increase in the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act also repealed the prohibition on paying interest on demand transaction accounts, but did not extend unlimited insurance protection for these accounts. 
 The FDIC may terminate its insurance of deposits if it finds that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 
 Tennessee statutes and the federal law regulate a variety of the banking activities of the Bank, including required reserves, investments, loans, mergers and consolidations, issuances of securities, payments of dividends, and the establishment of branches. There are certain limitations under federal and Tennessee law on the payment of dividends by banks. A state bank, with the approval of the TDFI, may transfer funds from its surplus account to the undivided profits (retained earnings) account or any part of its paid-in-capital account. The payment of dividends by any bank is dependent upon its earnings and financial condition and, in addition to the limitations referred to above, is subject to the statutory power of certain federal and state regulatory agencies to act to prevent what they deem unsafe or unsound banking practices. The payment of dividends could, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank, be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. Also, without regulatory approval, a dividend only can be paid to the extent of the net income of the Bank for that year plus the net income of the prior two years. The FDIA prohibits a state bank, the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC, from paying dividends if it is in default in the payment of any assessments due the FDIC. 
 State banks also are subject to regulation respecting the maintenance of certain minimum capital levels (see above), and the Bank is required to file annual reports and such additional information as the Tennessee Banking Act and Federal Reserve regulations require. The Bank also is subject to certain restrictions on loan amounts, interest rates, insider loans to officers, directors and principal shareholders, tie-in arrangements, privacy, transactions with affiliates, and many other matters. Strict compliance at all times with state and federal banking laws is required.

Tennessee law contains limitations on the interest rates that may be charged on various types of loans and restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be granted and on the types of investments which may be made. The operations of banks are also affected by various consumer laws and regulations, including those relating to equal credit opportunity and regulation of consumer lending practices. All Tennessee banks must become and remain insured banks under the FDIA. (See 12 U.S.C. § 1811, et seq.). 
 Under Tennessee law, state banks are prohibited from lending to any one person, firm, or corporation amounts more than 15% of its equity capital accounts, except (i) in the case of certain loans secured by negotiable title documents covering readily marketable nonperishable staples or (ii) the Bank may make a loan to one person, firm or corporation of up to 25% of its equity capital accounts with the prior written approval of the Banks Board of Directors or finance committee (however titled). 
 The TDFI and the Federal Reserve will examine the Bank periodically for compliance with various regulatory requirements. Such examinations, however, are for the protection of the DIF and for depositors and not for the protection of investors and shareholders. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) 
 FDICIA substantially revised the depository institution regulatory and funding provisions of the FDIA, and made revisions to several other federal banking statutes. Among other things, FDICIA requires the federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action in respect of FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under applicable regulations, a FDIC-insured depository institution is defined to be well capitalized if it maintains a Leverage Ratio of at least 5%, a risk adjusted Tier 1 Capital Ratio of at least 6% and a Total Capital Ratio of at least 10% and is not subject to a directive, order or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. An insured depository institution is defined to be adequately capitalized if it meets all of its minimum capital requirements as described above in the first paragraph of the section entitled Capital Guidelines. In addition, an insured depository institution is considered undercapitalized if it fails to meet any minimum required measure; significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a tier 1 risked-based capital ratio less than 3% or a leverage ratio less than 3%; and critically undercapitalized if it fails to maintain a level of tangible equity equal to not less than 2% of total assets. An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. 
 FDICIA generally prohibits an FDIC-insured depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of dividends) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. A depository institutions holding company must guarantee the capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institutions assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. 
 Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator generally within 90 days of the date on which they became critically undercapitalized. 
 The capital-based prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA and their implementing regulations apply to FDIC-insured depository institutions and are not directly applicable to the holding companies which control those institutions. However, the Federal Reserve has indicated that, in regulating bank holding companies, it will take appropriate action at the holding company level based on an assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary depository institutions pursuant to these provisions and regulations. 
 The FDIC has adopted regulations under FDICIA governing the receipt of brokered deposits and pass-through insurance. Under the regulations, a bank cannot accept or rollover or renew brokered deposits unless it is well capitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that cannot receive brokered deposits also cannot offer pass-through insurance on certain employee benefit accounts. Whether or not it has obtained this waiver, an adequately capitalized bank may not pay an interest rate on any deposits in excess of 75 basis points over certain index prevailing market rates specified by regulation. There are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized. 
 FDICIA contains numerous other provisions, including accounting, audit and reporting requirements, limitations on the FDICs payment of deposits at foreign branches, new regulatory standards in such areas as asset quality, earnings and compensation and revised regulatory standards for, among other things, powers of state banks, real estate lending and capital adequacy. FDICIA also requires that a depository institution provide 90 days prior notice of the closing of any branches.

The Dodd-Frank Act 
 In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, incorporating numerous financial institution regulatory reforms. Many of these reforms were implemented over the course of 2011-2013 and continue to be implemented through regulations being adopted by various federal banking and securities regulations. The following discussion describes the material elements of the regulatory framework. Many of the Dodd-Frank Act provisions are stated to only apply to larger financial institutions and do not directly impact community-based institutions like the Bank. For instance, provisions that regulate derivative transactions and limit derivatives trading activity of federally-insured institutions, enhance supervision of systemically significant institutions, impose new regulatory authority over hedge funds, limit proprietary trading by banks, and phase-out the eligibility of trust preferred securities for Tier 1 capital are among the provisions that do not directly impact the Bank either because of exemptions for institutions below a certain asset size or because of the nature of the Banks operations. Other provisions that have impacted or will impact the Bank: 

 | Change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital, eliminate the ceiling and increase the size of the floor of the DIF, and offset the impact of the increase in the minimum floor on institutions with less than $10 billion in assets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Make permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | Repeal the federal prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depositing institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB), responsible for implementing federal consumer protection laws, although banks below $10 billion in assets will continue to be examined and supervised for compliance with these laws by their federal bank regulator.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Restrict the preemption of state law by federal law and disallow national bank subsidiaries from availing themselves of such preemption.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Impose new requirements for mortgage lending, including new minimum underwriting standards, prohibitions on certain yield-spread compensation to mortgage originators, special consumer protections for mortgage loans that do not meet certain provision qualifications, prohibitions and limitations on certain mortgage terms and various new mandated disclosures to mortgage borrowers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to holding companies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Permit national and state banks to establish de novo interstate branches at any location where a bank based in that state could establish a branch, and require that bank holding companies and banks be well-capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Impose new limits on affiliated transactions and cause derivative transactions to be subject to lending limits.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Implement corporate governance revisions, including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access to shareholders that apply to all public companies not just financial institutions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FDIC Insurance Premiums 
 The Bank is required to pay quarterly FDIC deposit insurance assessments to the DIF. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The amount each institution is assessed is based upon statutory factors that include the balance of insured deposits as well as the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund. The FDIC uses a risk-based premium system that assesses higher rates on those institutions that pose greater risks to the DIF. 
 On March 15, 2016, the FDIC adopted a rule in accordance with provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that requires large institutions to bear the burden of raising the Reserve Ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. Since the Reserve Ratio has reached 1.15%, the FDIC will collect assessment surcharges from large institutions. Once the reserve ratio reaches 1.38%, small institutions will receive credits to offset their contribution to raising the Reserve Ratio to 1.35%. On April 26, 2016, the FDIC Board of Directors approved the final rule to improve the deposit insurance assessment system for established small insured depository institutions (generally, those banks with less than $10 billion in total assets that have been insured for at least five years). The final rule was effective July 1, 2016. Since the reserve ratio of the DIF reached 1.15 percent before that date, the final rule determined assessment rates beginning July 1, 2016. Effective July 1, 2016, the initial base assessment rates for all insured institutions were reduced from 5 to 35 basis points to 3 to 30 basis points. Total base assessment rates after possible adjustments were reduced from 2.5 to 45 basis points to 1.5 to 40 basis points. Although the base assessment rates were reduced, the assessment calculation includes pricing adjustments for certain financial

 ratios that relate to asset growth, loan mix, funding ratios, and nonperforming assets, which in the case of the Bank, have adversely impacted the Companys earnings due to increased premium assessments. Additional increases in premiums will impact FFNs earnings adversely. Depending on any future losses that the FDIC insurance fund may suffer due to failed institutions, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional significant premium increases in order to replenish the fund. 
 Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a federal bank regulatory agency. 
 The CRA 
 The CRA requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within its jurisdiction, the FDIC and the state banking regulators, as applicable, evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. These facts are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could impose additional requirements and limitations on us. Additionally, we must publicly disclose the terms of various CRA-related agreements. 
 Other Regulations 
 Interest and other charges that our subsidiary bank collects or contracts for are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Our banks loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as: 

 | The federal Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The rules and regulations of the various governmental agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, our bank subsidiarys deposit operations are subject to the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve to implement this act, which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. 
 Effects of Governmental Policies 
 The Banks earnings are affected by the difference between the interest earned by the Bank on its loans and investments and the interest paid by the Bank on its deposits or other borrowings. The yields on its assets and the rates paid on its liabilities are sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest. Thus, the earnings and growth of the Bank are influenced by general economic conditions, fiscal policies of the federal government, and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve, which establishes national monetary policy. The nature and impact of any future changes in fiscal or monetary policies cannot be predicted. 
 Commercial banks are affected by the credit policy of various regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and limitations on interest rates that banks may pay on time and savings deposits. The Federal Reserve uses these means in varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also to affect interest rates charged on loans, received on investments or paid for deposits. 
 The monetary and fiscal policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve, also affect the banking industry. Through changes in the reserve requirements against bank deposits, open market operations in U.S. Government securities and changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings, the Federal Reserve influences the cost and availability of funds obtained for lending and investing. No prediction can be made with respect to possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels or loan demand or with respect to the impact of such changes on the business and earnings of the Bank.

From time to time, legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities, or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. The nature and extent of the future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions and the resulting impact on those institutions is very unpredictable at this time. Bills are currently pending which may have the effect of changing the way the Bank conducts its business. 
 Recent Developments 
 Civic Acquisition 
 As previously disclosed, FFN and the Bank entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Bank Merger with Civic on December 14, 2015, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto, dated May 9, 2016, Amendment No. 2 thereto, dated March 30, 2017, and Amendment No. 3 thereto, dated September 29, 2017 (the Merger Agreement).
