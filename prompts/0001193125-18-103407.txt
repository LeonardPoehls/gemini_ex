Overview 
 We are a late-stage immuno-oncology company that is developing a pipeline of novel, proprietary product candidates that activate the immune system of cancer patients to recognize and eradicate tumors. Our vision is to improve and prolong the lives of cancer patients by advancing and expanding the field of immuno-oncology through novel combinations and treatment sequences of our pipeline products with standard of care chemotherapies and checkpoint inhibitors or with other emerging immunotherapies that elicit complementary and synergistic treatment effects. To achieve this vision, we have assembled a seasoned and talented group of industry veterans, scientists, clinicians, key opinion leaders and investors. 
 Our lead product candidate, AM0010 (pegilodecakin), stimulates the survival, expansion and tumor killing (cytotoxic) capacity of a particular white blood cell of the immune system, called the CD8+ T cell. We have focused on CD8+ T cells because these cells have been shown to recognize and kill cancer cells. An abundance of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells improves the prognosis and lengthens the survival of cancer patients. 
 AM0010 was advanced into late-stage clinical development as an immuno-oncology drug based on the results of our Phase 1/1b clinical trial in over 350 cancer patients across more than 14 different types of cancer and many treatment settings. AM0010 was well-tolerated in patients as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs or immune checkpoint inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab. In this ongoing Phase 1/1b clinical trial, we have observed objective tumor responses, including partial and complete responses. We

  have also seen improvements, compared to results published by Garon et al., Pembrolizumab for the Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, The New England Journal of Medicine (2015) (the Garon Article) and other studies published in medical literature, in objective tumor response rates and overall survival in patients treated with AM0010 in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs or immune checkpoint inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, which bind to a protein called PD-1. Based on the results from this Phase 1/1b clinical trial, the initial focus of our late-stage AM0010 development program is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). 
 Pancreatic cancer has the worst mortality rate of all cancers and is estimated to be the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States in 2017, according to the American Cancer Society. Despite the poor prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer, in our Phase 1/1b clinical trial, we have observed responses and overall survival in advanced-stage PDAC patients who were treated with AM0010 monotherapy or AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin), a standard of care chemotherapeutic regimen for this setting. The duration of overall survival and one-year landmark survival rate were 10.2 months and 42.9% in patients treated with AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX in our Phase 1/1b clinical trial whereas the historical duration of overall survival and one-year landmark survival rate is only 4.3 months and 18.5% for FOLFOX alone. 
 Based on these results, we initiated SEQUOIA, a Phase 3 randomized pivotal clinical trial in PDAC patients, which compares a combination of AM0010 and FOLFOX to FOLFOX alone, as a second-line therapy after tumor progression during or following a gemcitabine-containing regimen. We initiated this trial in the fourth quarter of 2016, enrolled the first patient in early 2017 and the first interim analysis was conducted on March 25, 2018. The first interim analysis was intended to deteremine if it was safe for the study to proceed based primarily on overall survival in the first 60 subjects enrolled in the study that received at least four months of therapy. After reviewing the data on those 60 patients, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended that the study continue without modifications. The second interim analysis, which could provide the basis for a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is expected to be conducted in 2020. Depending on the outcome of this trial, we may expand the SEQUOIA program and further develop this combination or potentially combinations of AM0010 and other chemotherapies, including gemcitabine-based chemotherapies, as a first-line therapy for pancreatic cancer. The FDA and European Commission (EC) have granted AM0010 Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Orphan Drug designation is a status granted to a product candidate for the treatment of a rare disease (with a population of less than 200,000) that qualifies the drug for incentives if regulatory approval for the drug is achieved. The FDA also granted Fast Track designation for AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX as a second-line therapy in patients with pancreatic cancer. Fast Track designation is a designation granted to drugs that demonstrate the ability to treat a serious or life threatening disease and provides the designee with the opportunity for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team and the potential for rolling review of completed portions of a marketing application even prior to submission of the comprehensive application. 
 Additionally, in our Phase 1/1b clinical trial, we have observed responses and overall survival in cancer patients who were treated with AM0010 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, that are longer than those reported in the Garon Article in comparable or earlier stage populations. For example, a cohort of 27 evaluable patients with advanced-stage NSCLC, who had received a median of two prior therapies, were treated with AM0010 in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors and had an objective response rate (ORR) of 41% regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression (41% and 40% ORRs for AM0010 plus nivolumab or pembrolizumab, respectively). This could represent an increase in ORR in NSCLC patients that received a median of two prior therapies compared to a 19% ORR as reported in the Garon Article for nivolumab as a monotherapy in a second-line setting regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. Response rates to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors correlate with tumor expression of PD-L1, a ligand for PD-1. Patients with high tumor PD-L1 expression (>50%) have a significantly higher chance to respond to treatment with checkpoint inhibitors than patients with low tumor PD-L1 expression (1-49%) or those who have no tumor PD-L1 expression (<1%). Importantly, we have observed ORRs for AM0010 in combination with 
 
2 


  anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors that are higher than reported for immune checkpoint inhibitors alone at all levels of tumor PD-L1 expression. For patients with tumors that highly expressed PD-L1 (>50%), the ORR was 80% (vs. 30% to 44% as reported in the Garon Article for pembrolizuamb monotherapy in the second-line setting of high tumor PD-L1 expression). Of particular interest is a 40% ORR (n=15, 6 PRs) in patients with low to no tumor PD-L1 expression (<50%) and a 33% ORR (n=12, 4 PRs) in patients with no tumor PD-L1 expression (<1%). In studies of pembrolizumab alone in tumor non-PD-L1 expressing patients the ORR was approximately 10%. These findings indicate that AM0010 may overcome non-PD-L1 mediated immune escape mechanisms and potentially improve the response rates in patient populations resistant or refractory to PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. 
 AM0010 may also increase the duration of responses and overall survival of NSCLC patients when used in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. The median progression-free survival (mPFS) for the AM0010 plus nivolumab cohort has not been reached while the mPFS in the AM0010 plus pembrolizumab cohort is 11 months regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression (vs. a mPFS of 4 months as reported in the Garon Article for pembrolizumab in a second-line setting). We are encouraged by the survival data we have seen thus far, by the duration of follow up on patients in both cohorts, and that the median overall survival has not been reached yet in the nivolumab cohort considering that the median overall survival of pembrolizumab has been reported to be 9.3 months in previously treated patients. The median overall survival of our pembrolizumab cohort has been reached in the first quarter of 2018 and will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. 
 Based on these results, we are launching CYPRESS, a Phase 2b clinical development program in NSCLC which will initially include two randomized clinical trials in patients with different levels of tumor PD-L1 expression in different lines of treatment. CYPRESS-1 will compare the safety and efficacy of AM0010 plus pembrolizumab to standard of care pembrolizumab alone as front-line therapy for patients with high tumor PD-L1 expression (>50%). CYPRESS-2 will compare the safety and efficacy of AM0010 plus nivolumab to standard of care nivolumab alone in a second-line setting (one prior therapy that was not a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor) in patients with low tumor PD-L1 expression (<50%). We plan to begin enrolling patients in these trials in the first quarter of 2018 and given the open label design of the trials we expect to have preliminary response data in a meaningful number of patients in both trials by late 2018, which we expect will inform our regulatory strategy and next steps in the development of AM0010 in NSCLC. We also expect to have additional data from both trials in 2019. Based on the results of CYPRESS-1 and CYPRESS-2 and the evolving treatment landscape for NSCLC, we may expand the CYPRESS program to include additional studies that could support registration of AM0010, as well as seeking to develop our own independent, proprietary combination regimen in the immuno-oncology space by including our pipeline anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (AM0001). 
 We continue to evaluate the results from our ongoing Phase 1/1b clinical trial assessing encouraging signals that justify further development of AM0010 in additional tumor types, such as, but not restricted to, RCC, colorectal cancer (CRC), melanoma and breast cancer. 
 In addition to AM0010, our immuno-oncology pipeline includes a number of validated product candidates. AM0001 is our anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor currently undergoing Investigational New Drug Application (IND) enabling studies. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial with AM0001 in advanced malignancies in 2018 and plan to subsequently combine this immune checkpoint inhibitor with AM0010 to develop our first proprietary immuno-oncology combination regimen. AM0015 is a pre-IND stage recombinant human Interleukin-15 (IL-15) cytokine that has demonstrated preclinical anti-tumor responses that are additive with AM0010. AM0012 is a recombinant human Interleukin-12 (IL-12) cytokine currently in preclinical studies. Cytokines are small proteins that are made by immune cells and non-immune cells and have an effect on the immune system and other physiologic functions. Some cytokines stimulate the immune system and others inhibit it. AM0003 is our anti-LAG-3 checkpoint inhibitor program that is undergoing pre-IND enabling studies. LAG-3 (Lymphocyte-activation gene 3) is a cell surface protein and immune checkpoint receptor.

 Product Candidate Pipeline 
 We have built a pipeline of proprietary product candidates that activate the immune system of patients to recognize and eradicate their tumors. 
 

Clinical Product Candidate 
 AM0010 (pegilodecakin)PEGylated recombinant human Interleukin-10 (IL-10)
AM0010 is a long acting form of human Interleukin-10 (IL-10). IL-10 is a naturally occurring immune cell growth factor in humans that is critical for the proliferation and cytotoxic activity of tumor specific CD8+ T cells. We increased the size of IL-10 by linking it to polyethylene glycol (PEG) to prolong its circulation time in the body of patients and thus maximizing its capability to activate anti-tumor CD8+ T cells. This PEGylated form of IL-10 is called AM0010 (pegilodecakin) and has been studied in our ongoing Phase 1/1b clinical trial in over 350 cancer patients across a multitude of tumor types and many treatment settings. We have also initiated SEQUOIA a Phase 3 clinical trial in PDAC. The PDAC Phase 3 protocol was discussed with the FDA in a Type B Pre-IND/Pre-Phase 3 meeting in September 2016, we began enrolling patients in early 2017, have randomized 179 patients as of March 15, 2018, and the first interim analysis was conducted in March 2018. The first interim analysis was intended to deteremine if it was safe for the study to proceed based primarily on overall survival in the first 60 subjects enrolled in the study that received at least four months of therapy. After reviewing the data on those 60 patients, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended that the study continue without modifications. The second interim analysis, which could provide the basis for a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is expected to be conducted in 2020. In addition, we are initiating two Phase 2 randomized clinical trials in NSCLC (CYPRESS-1 and CYPRESS-2) and we are evaluating clinical trials in additional indications. We plan to begin enrolling patients in the two CYPRESS trials in the first quarter of 2018 and given the open label design of the trials we expect to have preliminary response data in a meaningful number of patients in both trials by late 2018, which we expect will inform our regulatory strategy and next steps in the development of AM0010 in NSCLC. We also expect to have additional data from both trials in 2019. We licensed PEGylated IL-10 from Merck, Sharp & Dohme Corporation (Merck). For more information about the Merck Agreement, see the section below entitled Merck Agreement.

 Pre-IND Product Candidates 
 AM0001Monoclonal antibody directed against Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitor 
 AM0001 is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that activates CD8+ T cells by blocking the interaction between the immune checkpoint Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 (PD-1) receptor situated on the surface of CD8+ T cells and Programmed Cell Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1), a transmembrane protein situated on the surface of a tumor cell. PD-1 down-regulates the immune system and promotes self-tolerance by suppressing T cell inflammatory activity. PD-1 is an immune checkpoint and guards against autoimmunity through a dual mechanism of promoting apoptosis (programmed cell death) of antigen-specific T cells in lymph nodes while simultaneously reducing apoptosis in regulatory T cells (anti-inflammatory, suppressive T cells). PD-L1 plays a major role in suppressing the immune system in certain conditions like cancer and has been implicated in the process of tumor immune escape. AM0001 has characteristics and properties similar to the marketed anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab. We discussed the development of this molecule with the FDA in a pre-IND meeting. We are currently conducting IND-enabling studies with the intent to start a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2018. 
 AM0015Recombinant human Interleukin-15 (IL-15)
AM0015 is a recombinant human Interleukin-15. IL-15 is an activator of the immune system that induces proliferation of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, cells of the innate immune system whose principal role is to kill tumor cells and cells infected by a virus. In preclinical animal models, AM0015 induced anti-tumor responses that are additive or synergistic with the antitumor effects of AM0010. The mechanism of action by which AM0015 affects CD8+ T cells and induces anti-tumor responses is different than that of AM0010. We have received pre-IND feedback from the FDA regarding the development of this molecule in combination with AM0010. 
 Preclinical Product Candidates 
 AM0012Recombinant human Interleukin-12 (IL-12)
AM0012 is a recombinant human Interleukin-12. IL-12 induces activation and proliferation of CD8+ T cells and NK cells that have antitumor effects. In preclinical animal models, AM0012 induced anti-tumor responses through a mechanism of action that could be additive or synergistic with the anti-tumor effects of AM0010. 
 AM0003Monoclonal antibody directed against Leukocyte Activating Gene-3 protein program 
 The AM0003 program is developing a mAb directed against the Leukocyte Activating Gene-3 (LAG-3) protein. LAG-3 is an immune checkpoint inhibition protein situated on the cell surface of CD8+ T cells. As such, LAG-3 inhibitors induce the activation and proliferation of CD8+ T cells that have anti-tumor effects. 
 Our strategy 
 Our vision is to improve and prolong the lives of cancer patients by advancing and expanding the field of immuno-oncology through novel combinations and treatment sequences of our pipeline products with standard of care chemotherapies and checkpoint inhibitors or with other emerging immunotherapies that elicit complementary and synergistic treatment effects. 
 Key elements of our strategy include: 
 Rapidly advance the development of AM0010 as a cornerstone treatment for enhancing, augmenting and broadening the therapeutic effect of existing standard of care and emerging therapies in a number of tumor types, including high unmet need resistant and refractory malignancies. 
 A cornerstone of our AM0010 development program is novel combinational and sequential approaches with standard of care chemotherapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors or other emerging immuno-oncology therapies. 
 
5 


  We believe AM0010 synergizes with these standard of care and emerging therapies to augment and expand anti-tumor responses beyond those seen when either agent is used separately. Consequently, we believe this synergy will lead to higher response rates, longer lasting responses and improved patient outcomes when compared to the current standard of care. More importantly, we believe this synergy may elicit responses in resistant and refractory tumors, broadening into areas of substantial unmet medical need where the therapeutic utility of existing and emerging treatments can be combined or sequenced with AM0010. 
 Rapidly advance AM0010 through a pivotal clinical trial in combination with chemotherapy as a second-line therapy in PDAC. 
 We are developing AM0010 in combination with standard of care chemotherapy (FOLFOX) for the treatment of second-line PDAC patients. We plan to continue the Phase 3 SEQUOIA clinical trial of AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX compared with FOLFOX alone in PDAC patients that have progressed during or following initial treatment with a gemcitabine-containing regimen. The first interim analysis was conducted on March 25, 2018 and was intended to deteremine if it was safe for the study to proceed based primarily on overall survival in the first 60 subjects enrolled in the study that received at least four months of therapy. After reviewing the data on those 60 patients, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended that the study continue without modifications. The second interim analysis, which could provide the basis for a BLA submission, is expected to be conducted in 2020. Further development of AM0010 in treatment-naïve PDAC is dependent on the result of the SEQUOIA trial. 
 Rapidly advance the development of AM0010 in combination with established immune checkpoint inhibitors and potentially with AM0001 in NSCLC across levels of tumor PD-L1 expression and lines of therapy. 
 We are developing AM0010 in combination with standard of care immune checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC across levels of PD-L1 expression and across lines of therapy. We plan to initiate Phase 2 clinical trials of AM0010 in combination with pembrolizumab compared to pembrolizumab standard of care in the front-line setting of patients with high tumor PD-L1 expression (CYPRESS-1) and AM0010 in combination with nivolumab compared to nivolumab standard of care in the second-line setting of patients with low tumor PD-L1 expression (CYPRESS-2). We plan to begin enrolling patients in these trials in the first quarter of 2018 and given the open label design of the trials we expect to have preliminary response data in a meaningful number of patients in both trials by late 2018, which we expect will inform our regulatory strategy and next steps in the development of AM0010 in NSCLC. We also expect to have additional data from both trials in 2019. 
 Based on the results of CYPRESS-1 and CYPRESS-2 and the evolving treatment landscape for NSCLC, we may expand the CYPRESS program and, importantly, seek to develop our own independent, proprietary combination regimen in the immuno-oncology space by including our pipeline anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (AM0001). 
 Rapidly advance the development of AM0010 in other select oncology indications where strong treatment effect signals have been identified in our ongoing Phase 1/1b clinical trial. 
 We continue to evaluate treatment effect signals from our Phase 1/1b clinical trial. To date, the strongest preliminary treatment effect signals outside PDAC and NSCLC have emerged in RCC, CRC, melanoma and breast cancer. In addition, there is early pre-clinical evidence that IL-10 may have clinical utility in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Initiating a Phase 2 program in these or other areas will depend on definitive evaluation of these signals as well as the state of the emerging treatment landscape for these indications. 
 Rapidly advance the development of our immunotherapy pipeline product candidates into clinical trials. 
 We intend to develop our immuno-oncology pipeline of assets, which includes AM0001, AM0015, AM0012 and AM0003. AM0001 is our anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor currently undergoing IND-enabling studies and we 
 
6 


  expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2018 and plan to subsequently combine this immune checkpoint inhibitor with AM0010 to develop our first proprietary immuno-oncology combination regimen. AM0015 and AM0012 are our product candidates that have demonstrated preclinical anti-tumor responses that could be additive or synergistic with anti-tumor effects of AM0010. AM0003 is our anti-LAG-3 checkpoint inhibitor program for which we are conducting preclinical studies. 
 Continued focus on internal discovery efforts. 
 Based on our expertise in immuno-oncology and the results from our clinical trials, we expect to commit resources to the research of additional product candidates that may work independently of, or complement, those in our existing pipeline. We seek to leverage the extensive experience of our team to further expand our expertise in CD8+ T cell and cytokine biology and to discover and develop novel, proprietary product candidates that activate the immune system to recognize and eradicate tumors. 
 Opportunistically in-license and acquire novel immuno-oncology assets. 
 We plan to leverage our clinical immuno-oncology expertise and our relationships in the oncology community to identify and in-license or acquire additional product candidates that we believe have the potential to become novel treatments for oncology indications with significant unmet medical needs. 
 Potentially seek strategic collaborative relationships while maintaining flexibility in commercializing and maximizing the value of our development programs. 
 We currently have global development, marketing and commercialization rights for all of the product candidates in our pipeline. We plan to develop and seek regulatory approval for their use in oncology indications. While we may develop these products independently, we also may enter into strategic relationships with biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to realize the full value of these products. 
 Overview of Cancer Treatment 
 Introduction 
 Cancer is a complex, often fatal, disease arising from uncontrolled cell growth and the ability of cancer cells to avoid the immune system, the bodys primary defense mechanism for finding and destroying such aberrant cells. The American Cancer Society estimated that in 2017 there will be an estimated 1,688,780 new cancer cases diagnosed with 600,920 cancer deaths in the United States alone. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease, and accounts for nearly 1 of every 4 deaths. This clearly establishes the significant unmet clinical need that still exists in cancer treatment. 
 There are many types of cancer treatments, including chemotherapies and more recently immunotherapies. In general, cancer therapies involve the combination of the aforementioned therapy options in order to optimize therapeutic outcome for patients. 
 Chemotherapy 
 Chemotherapies are cancer treatments that use cytotoxic drugs to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy is often given in combination with other treatments in order to increase therapeutic efficacy because different drugs kill cancer cells through different mechanisms of action. An example of such a combination therapy is FOLFOX, which is used for the treatment of PDAC and other gastrointestinal cancers such as colorectal cancer (CRC). A FOLFOX treatment regimen combines three different chemotherapeutic drugs, leucovorin calcium (calcium folinate), 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. Chemotherapy regimens seldom result in the full eradication of disease and cure of patients. 
 
7 


 Research has shown that the tumor cell death induced by several standard of care chemotherapeutic drugs is also able to stimulate the immune system which may add to the mechanism by which they elicit anti-tumor activity. More specifically, certain chemotherapies, such as oxaliplatin, induce immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, which activates the immune system and CD8+ T cells. Tumors that are resistant or refractory to treatment with checkpoint inhibitors represent a clear unmet clinical need in which a combination of AM0010 with chemotherapy may offer a therapeutic option. Consequently, there is mounting interest in the medical field to combine chemotherapies with immuno-oncology drugs. Based on their complementary mechanisms of action, our products such as AM0010 may be well positioned to be used in combination with chemotherapies, especially in patients that are resistant or refractory to current cancer immunotherapies. 
 Immunotherapy 
 Cancer immunotherapies are cancer treatments that stimulate or enhance the immune system of patients to recognize and subsequently eradicate tumor cells. The goal of cancer immunotherapy is also to achieve lasting responses against cancer cells. The potential of immuno-oncology therapies to instill an anti-cancer response in patients offers a potential crucial advantage over existing cancer therapies due to the intrinsic features of the immune system. For instance, the immune system exhibits immunologic diversity and selectivity, which enables it to respond to a large number of potential targets. In addition, once triggered, the immune response can be amplified, offering the potential to enhance the efficacy of treatment. Furthermore, once activated, the immune system possesses immunologic memory, potentially providing for a durable and long-lasting response. Since most tumor types accumulate mutations, immunotherapy may be widely applicable to many types of cancer and not limited to a particular tumor type. This allows for these agents to be potentially active in a multitude of tumor types. 
 The immune system is composed of different cell types including natural killer cells, macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes, that all can contribute to the immune destruction of cancer cells. The type of immune cell that has been associated most frequently with successful cancer immunotherapy is the cytotoxic T lymphocyte, also called the CD8+ T cell. The presence of CD8+ T cells inside a patients tumors is associated with better progression-free survival in a number of cancer types. The persistence and expansion of CD8+ T cells, along with their introduction of cytotoxic enzymes (granzymes), helps CD8+ T cells to kill cancer cells and are associated with a patients likelihood for long term survival. This is based on the fact that CD8+ T cells can recognize and subsequently kill cancer cells. Once CD8+ T cells have recognized a particular tumor, they develop an immune memory that elicits subsequent anti-tumor responses even after prolonged periods of time following the first exposure. This phenomenon is called immune surveillance. 
 Research has shown that tumors develop sophisticated survival and escape mechanisms, allowing them to avoid immune-mediated destruction. This tumor immune escape mechanism appears to be aided by immune checkpoint proteins which are molecules that shut down the anti-tumor response capability of CD8+ T cells. Clinical trials have shown that treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors can restore and unleash the cancer-destroying properties of CD8+ T cells and results in durable clinical responses. These observations have led to the FDA approval of several checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4), nivolumab (anti-PD-1), pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) and atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1). Treatment with checkpoint inhibitors has shown the ability to activate CD8+ T cells, shrink tumors, and improve patient survival. 
 Despite this recent clinical success and the unprecedented tumor responses seen in patients, checkpoint inhibitors unfortunately provide help to only a fraction of patients in a select few immune sensitive cancers, including melanoma, renal and lung cancer. While responses occur in these cancer types, the majority of patients receive little or no benefit and consequently progress on therapy with checkpoint inhibitors. In addition, the vast majority of patients with immune insensitive cancers such as pancreatic, colorectal and breast cancer have not received any benefit from monotherapy treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. A combination of AM0010 with chemotherapy or with checkpoint inhibitors may offer a better treatment option in these patient populations either in first or later lines of therapy. 
 
8 


 One hypothesis for the lack of clinical performance of checkpoint inhibitors in immune insensitive cancers postulates that non-responding patients have too few tumor specific CD8+ T cells with adequate anti-tumor potential in their cancer. Therefore, it is generally accepted that there is a need for products that are well-tolerated to combine with checkpoint inhibitors and provide at least additive or synergistic benefit to patients. 
 There are naturally occurring immune growth factors in our body that are called cytokines that can stimulate the activation and proliferation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. IL-10 is a naturally occurring growth factor that is essential for the activation and expansion of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and thus we believe that AM0010, a long acting form of human IL-10, is well positioned for use in combination with other immuno-oncology therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors. 
 AM0010 as Immunotherapy 
 Tumor cells accumulate genetic mutations which distinguish them from normal cells and make them appear foreign to the immune system and visible to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Today there are significant data supporting the assertion that tumor immune surveillance and cancer immunotherapies depend in large part on the presence of activated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the tumor. Unfortunately, in most cancers intra-tumoral CD8+ T cells are rare and appear to lack sufficient cytotoxic activity. As a consequence, spontaneous immune-mediated remissions are exceptional in most cancers. 
 Independent investigators have shown over the past two decades that IL-10 increases the number of activated CD8+ T cells in tumors. While IL-10 stimulates the proliferation and activation of resident intra-tumoral CD8+ T cells, IL-10 also recruits new CD8+ T cells to infiltrate the tumor. Furthermore, IL-10 induces intra-tumoral CD8+ T cells to secrete interferon- g (IFN g) which is a cytokine that increases the visibility of tumor cells to the immune system, thereby augmenting the recognition of tumor cells by CD8+ T cells. IL-10 also increases the production of molecules used by activated CD8+ T cells to kill tumor cells, such as granzymes. Additionally, IL-10 decreases inflammatory cytokines and markers that are important regulators of the suppressive tumor microenvironment. In conclusion, IL-10 increases the expansion of activated, intra-tumoral CD8+ T cells that recognize and kill tumor cells and modifies the tumor environment to be more permissive to these activities. IL-10 is known to contribute to naturally occurring anti-tumor immune surveillance. These data illustrate the potential of a long acting form of IL-10, AM0010, as an immunotherapy drug. 
 We believe that combination therapy of AM0010 with chemotherapy or checkpoint inhibitors may provide an attractive treatment option to patients that do not respond to other therapies. 
 Preclinical Studies 
 In our preclinical studies, a PEGylated form of mouse IL-10 (PEG-mIL-10) eradicated both primary and metastatic tumor lesions in mice. Due to its longer residence time in the body, PEG-mIL-10 has superior anti-tumor activity compared to non-PEGylated IL-10. This therapeutic effect resulted from the increased infiltration and expansion of cancer specific CD8+ T cells in the tumor. 
 In a mouse model of skin cancer (squamous cell, a type of skin cell, carcinoma PDV6), PEG-mIL-10 treatment cured the majority of the mice, even when treatment started after the tumor had reached a substantial size compared to the body mass of the mice. Once the mice were cured, they did not relapse even after cessation of therapy with PEG-mIL-10. In contrast, the tumors in the untreated animals increased rapidly in size and ultimately led to the animals death. This indicates that PEG-mIL-10 treatment induces immune mediated eradication of the primary tumors while establishing immune surveillance that protects the animals from relapse after cessation of therapy.

 Effect of PEG-mIL-10 on Primary Tumor Growth in the Mouse PDV6 Cancer Model 
 

The induction of immune surveillance was further investigated by re-challenging animals with the same PDV6 tumor after different periods, following PEG-mIL-10 induced cure in two independent experiments with 10 mice per cohort. When PDV6 tumor cells were implanted 5-8 months after PEG-mIL-10 induced cure, 90% and 100% of the mice in the two cohorts rejected the secondary implantation and remained tumor free in the absence of further treatment. This immune response was PDV6-specific since PEG-mIL-10 treated mice were incapable of recognizing different tumor types. This provides evidence that PEG-mIL-10 treatment resulted in the establishment of tumor-specific immune surveillance in the mice. 
 In a mouse model of breast carcinoma (4T1) that develops both primary and metastatic tumors, PEG-mIL-10 diminished the growth of the primary tumor by 90% while also reducing metastatic spread by 99%. In this very aggressive model, which is largely resistant to chemotherapy, PEG-mIL-10 treatment still resulted in a 20% cure rate. 
 Chemotherapeutic drugs are the standard of care treatments for many different cancers. Unpublished data have shown that widely used chemotherapeutic drugs have a mechanism of action that could be additive or synergistic with PEG-mIL-10. Both 5-FU and oxaliplatin kill tumor cells which leads to the release of molecules that activate CD8+ T cells. In preclinical cancer models, PEG-mIL-10 single agent activity was further improved in the presence of chemotherapies, suggesting the additive or synergistic activity between the two agents in these models. 
 For example, in a mouse model of colorectal cancer (CT 26), the combination of PEG-mIL-10 with 5-FU resulted in a reduction in tumor volume of over 70%, which is almost double the effect of each drug separately. In the metastatic mouse model of breast cancer (4T1), the combination of PEG-mIL-10 with platinum compounds showed an improved outcome compared to either drug alone. In the 4T1 breast cancer model, the combination of PEG-mIL-10 with docetaxel also showed improved outcome compared to either drug alone.

 AM0010 Phase 1/1b Clinical Trial 
 We submitted an IND for AM0010 to the FDA that became active in 2013. We have an ongoing Phase 1/1b clinical trial that is assessing the safety, tolerability, dosing and therapeutic activity of AM0010 as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapies or immune checkpoint inhibitors. We are also studying AM0010s mechanism of action. We have enrolled over 350 patients with advanced cancer across more than 14 cancer indications. We have observed objective tumor responses (ORR), including complete responses (CRs), partial responses (PRs) and stable disease (SD) in patients treated with AM0010 as a single agent (monotherapy) or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs or anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. A CR is defined as a complete disappearance of all tumor lesions, a PR is defined as a reduction of the tumor burden by at least 50% in the absence of CR, and a SD is defined as a stable tumor burden that neither decreases by more than 50% nor increases by 25% or more. 
 Exploratory endpoints measured sustained CD8+ T cell activation and anti-inflammatory properties, as characterized by the following biomarkers: 
 

 | Systemic and sustained increase of molecules that are critical for tumor immune recognition and CD8+ T cell activation and expansion, such as interferon- g (IFN g), IL-18, IL-7, IL-4, GM-CSF
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Sustained expansion of activated proliferating PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in the blood of patients
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increased presence of tumor killing molecules such as granzymes in intra-tumoral CD8+ T cells
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Progressive, systemic de-novo expansion of novel T cell clones that may recognize neoantigens regardless of the prevalence of mutations in the tumor type
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Systemic and sustained reduction of inflammatory molecules such as IL-12p40, IL-17, IL-23 and TGF-ß
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preliminary data from our ongoing Phase 1/1b clinical trial suggest that AM0010 treatment results in the tumor infiltration and intra-tumoral activation and expansion of CD8+ T cells that are expressing increased levels of granzymes. This is best illustrated by the pictures below, which shows a liver metastasis in a CRC patient with stable disease before (Left) and during (Right) AM0010 monotherapy. While there are hardly any Granzyme+ CD8+ T cells present before treatment, their number increases during the course of AM0010 single agent treatment. Surrounding these Granzyme+ CD8+ T cells there is also evidence of cell debris resulting from immune induced tumor destruction. These photographs illustrate the impact that AM0010 has on the immune state of tumors, primarily related to the activation, expansion and tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells loaded with tumor cytotoxic granzyme and how AM0010 changes the immunological status of tumors from cold to hot.

In addition to the mechanistic data illustrating AM0010s immunotherapeutic activity, preliminary data from the Phase 1/1b clinical trial demonstrated durable responses, as measured by overall survival. The survival benefit for AMOO1O alone or in combination with standard of care in these populations with advanced stage diseases are longer than those observed historically, based on the medical literature in comparable or earlier stage populations. The table below shows the diseases in our Phase 1/1b clinical trial where patients exposed to AM0010 alone or in combination with other agents (e.g. chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors) experienced complete and partial responses or a survival benefit when compared to results published in the Garon Article and other studies published in medical literature.

 An example of a partial response and the impact of AM0010 monotherapy on both primary and secondary metastases is illustrated by the scans below. Below is a series of scans from a patient with RCC and metastases to the lung who was treated with AM0010 alone. This patient experienced a 90% reduction in the primary lesion with complete elimination of the lung metastases. At two years the patient remains in partial response for the primary lesion and complete response for the lung metastases.

 Reduction of Lung Metastases in a RCC Patient Treated with AM0010 Monotherapy for More than Two Years 
 

Phase 1/1b Clinical Trial Safety Results 
 AM0010 was well-tolerated in over 350 patients as a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy or anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in the Phase 1/1b clinical trial. Most of the patients enrolled in the Phase 1/1b clinical trial were advanced stage and heavily pretreated. Patients who received prior therapies, including chemotherapeutics known to be toxic to the bone marrow, would typically be more likely to experience lower levels of erythrocytes and thrombocytes in the blood after treatment, resulting in higher rates of anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia compared to patients who had received fewer prior courses of therapy. The most common treatment related adverse events across indications (TRAEs) were anemia (lower-than-normal number of red blood cells), fatigue, thrombocytopenia (lower-than-normal number of platelets in that blood) and fever. For the 144 patients receiving AM0010 monotherapy, 78 (54.2%) experienced anemia, 63 (43.8%) experienced fatigue, 71 (49.3%) experienced thrombocytopenia and 53 (36.8%) experienced fever. For the 25 PDAC patients receiving AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX, 16 (64.0%) experienced anemia, 18 (72.0%) experienced fatigue, 19 (76.0%) experienced thrombocytopenia and three (12.0%) experienced fever. For the 34 NSCLC patients receiving AM0010 in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor, 14 (41.2%) experienced anemia, 12 (35.3%) experienced fatigue, 14 (41.2%) experienced thrombocytopenia and nine (26.5%) experienced fever. For the 38 RCC patients receiving AM0010 in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor, 19 (50%) experienced anemia, 16 (42.1%) experienced fatigue, 24 (63.2%) experienced thrombocytopenia and 12 (31.6%) experienced fever. These TRAEs were typically transient and had a rapid return to baseline within two to seven days, and we have made changes to our dosing schedule in our Phase 3 PDAC study intended to reduce the incidence of these events. 
 Administration of some therapeutic proteins has been associated with hypersensitivity reactions. There were no reported hypersensitivity treatment related adverse events in the Phase 1/1b clinical trial except for mild injection site reactions in 10.4% of patients receiving AM0010 monotherapy (n=144) and all of these patients continued dosing without exacerbation of injection site reactions. 
 Autoimmune treatment related adverse events (irAEs) have been associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and CTLA-4 inhibitors). These irAEs can range from common but low morbidity toxicities such as rash, pruritus, fatigue and loss of appetite to more serious complications such as vitiligo, 
 
13 


  pneumonitis, mucocytis, colitis, hepatitis, cholangitis, polyarthritis, myasthenia gravis, optic neuritis and a variety of endocrinopathies (e.g. thyroiditis, thyroiditis, hypophysitis). In our Phase 1/1b clinical trial, 144 subjects were exposed to AM0010 monotherapy and none experienced the serious complications of vitiligo, hepatitis, polyarthritis, or myasthesnia gravis. 
 In the NSCLC cohort of our Phase 1/1b clinical trial, 29 patients with a mean of two prior therapies received AM0010 plus nivolumab. 13 of 29 patients treated with AM0010 plus nivolumab experienced rash, pruritus, and/or fatigue with rash reported in eight patients, pruritus reported in two patients, and fatigue reported in eight patients. In addition, one case of pneumonitis, one case of hypothyroidism and one case of optic neuritis were reported. In summary, 15 out of 29 (52%) NSCLC subjects receiving AM0010 plus nivolumab experienced an irAE. If less serious side effects including rash, pruritus, fatigue and loss of appetite are excluded, three out of 29 (10%) patients experienced an irAE. One event of each of pneumonitis, hypoohysitis and optic neuritis was observed in the 29 patients. 
 Based on one report by Haratani et al. in JAMA Oncology (Association of Immune-Related Adverse Events With Nivolumab Efficacy in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (2017)), the overall irAE rate for nivolumab alone in the second-line or greater setting of 134 NSCLC subjects was approximately 51%. If less serious side effects including rash, pruritus, fatigue and loss of appetite are excluded in this analysis, the rate of irAEs is approximately 30%, which included two patients that experienced vitiligo, six patients that experienced pneumonitis, 10 patients that experienced thyroiditis/hypothyroiditis, hypophysitis, three patients that experienced mucocytis, 10 patients that experienced diarrhea/colitis, five patients that experienced hepatitis, two patients that experienced cholangitis, one patients that experienced polyarthritis and one patients that experienced Myasthenia gravis. 
 Based on this comparison, the overall irAE rate for nivolumab alone versus AM0010 plus nivolumab was similar (51% vs. 52%). However, the rate of immune-related complications appears to favor the combination of AM0010 and nivolumab (~10%) over nivolumab alone (~30%) when rash, pruritus, fatigue and loss of appetite are excluded. These results appear to indicate that the anti-inflammatory properties of AM0010 may reduce certain immune-related complications when used in combination with an anti-PD-1 inhibitor such as nivolumab. In practice, this outcome could increase the dose intensity of AM0010 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor combinations and reduce the morbidity and costs associated with immune-related complications. 
 All biologic agents have the potential for the development of anti-drug antibodies, which are antibodies made by immune cells that are directed against the drug. These auto-antibodies in a high enough concentrations, or titer, can neutralize the therapeutic effect of the drug they are directed against. None of the patients tested in the Phase 1/1b clinical trial developed high titers of anti-drug antibodies or experienced a detectable reduction of AM0010 in circulation due to them. 
 AM0010 with FOLFOX in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma 
 The Pancreatic Cancer Market size 
 Approximately 53,670 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected to be diagnosed in the United States in 2017. Over the last decade the incidence of pancreatic cancer has increased, largely due to the increasing prevalence of obesity and an aging population. In 2017, an estimated 43,090 deaths from pancreatic cancer are expected in the United States. According to the American Cancer Society, pancreatic cancer is estimated to be the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States in 2017. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) accounts for over 90% of pancreatic malignancies. We believe AM0010 in combination with chemotherapy represents a promising therapeutic option for patients with this serious life-threatening disease. 
 Current treatments in PDAC and survival rates 
 According to the American Cancer Society, pancreatic cancer mortality rates lead all other cancers, with five-year survival rates of about 7%, which declines to 3% if the disease is diagnosed at distant stage. Patients who 
 
14 


  present with locally-advanced or metastatic disease are ineligible for surgical resection. For such patients, first-line standard of care chemotherapy includes gemcitabine in combination with albumin-bound paclitaxel plus gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX (folinic acid, 5fluorouracil [5-FU], irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) in good performance status patients, which have a performance status of 0 or 1 as measured by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance scale (ECOG). Single agent gemcitabine remains the standard of care treatment for patients with ECOG 2 performance status, which denotes the presence of more advance disease and decreased patient function. It is estimated that only 50% of PDAC patients in the U.S. are able to go on to receive second and occasionally third-line chemotherapy. With first-line followed by second-line therapy, PDAC patients have a median overall survival (mOS) up to 13.5 months. 
 Second-line treatment options for PDAC are 5-FU, leucovorin, capecitabine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan or gemcitabine, used alone or in combination. A combination of 5-FU, leucovorin and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is widely accepted for second-line treatment of PDAC patients who progressed after a gemcitabine-containing regimen. Several small trials with these agents show only a modest median progression-free survival (mPFS) ranging between 1.5 and 2.9 months and a mOS ranging between 3.5 to 5.9 months with second-line treatments and, in one study, disease control rates of approximately 36%. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Onivyde (liposomal formulation of irinotecan), in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin for second-line PDAC based on a mOS of 6.1 months.

 AM0010 monotherapy 
 Treatment with AM0010 monotherapy in our Phase 1/1b clinical trial showed a mOS of 3.8 months, mPFS of 1.7 months and one-year survival of 22.7% as of October 29, 2017. These results are comparable to a mOS of 4.3 months, mPFS of 1.7 months, a disease control rate of 36% and one-year survival of 18.5% reported in a study of 27 patients treated with FOLFOX in the second-line setting that was sponsored by AGEO (Association des gastroentérologues oncologues/Gastroenterologists Oncologists Association) and conducted between 2007 and 2012 (Zaanan et al., FOLFOX as Second-Line Chemotherapy in Patients with Pretreated Metastatic Pancreatic

  Cancer from the FIRGEM Study, BMC Cancer (2014) (the Zaanan Article). These preliminary results suggest that AM0010 monotherapy in later-line, advanced PDAC is comparable to those results seen with FOLFOX in an exclusively second-line population. 
 Overall Survival in PDAC Patients Treated with AM0010 Monotherapy (median 4th LOT, n=22) 
 

Reduction in the serum level of the carbohydrate antigen (CA 19-9) tumor marker has been associated with a prolonged overall survival of patients with pancreatic cancer treated with a gemcitabine based regimen. CA 19-9 is a tumor marker that is elevated in the blood of approximately 60-74% of patients with pancreatic cancer. In our Phase 1/1b clinical trial, twelve PDAC patients receiving AM0010 monotherapy had elevated levels of the tumor marker CA 19-9 and a baseline and post-baseline measurement. Of these 12 patients, 66.7% had a reduction in CA 19-9, 50.0% had a reduction in CA 19-9 of at least 20% and 25.0% had a reduction in CA 19-9 of at least 60%. 
 CA 19-9 Serum Levels in PDAC Patients Treated with AM0010 Monotherapy 
 

AM0010 and FOLFOX combination 
 Treatment with AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX is currently being explored in our Phase 1/1b clinical trial in PDAC patients with a median number of two prior therapies. As of October 29, 2017, mPFS for advanced stage, later-line PDAC patients treated with the combination of AM0010 and FOLFOX was 2.6 months compared to 1.7 months for AM0010 alone and 1.7 months for FOLFOX alone according to the Zaanan Article and in an exclusively second-line population. The mOS for the combination of AM0010 and FOLFOX was 10.2 months as compared to 4.3 months for FOLFOX alone according to the Zaanan Article and in an exclusively 
 
16 


  second-line population. In addition, the landmark one-year survival for the combination of AM0010 and FOLFOX was 42.9% compared to 18.5% for FOLFOX, again according to the Zaanan Article and in an exclusively second-line population. We are encouraged by the tail on the overall survival curve which is indicative of long-term survivors. Finally, there were objective responses in PDAC patients treated with the combination of AM0010 and FOLFOX including two complete responses. The overall response rate was 15.8% and the disease control rate was 73.7%. The median follow-up for the study is 20.3 months (range 15.8 months to 25.9 months). 
 Overall Survival in PDAC Patients Treated with a Combination of AM0010 and FOLFOX (n=21) 
 

Data as of December 13, 2017 
 The combination of AM0010 with FOLFOX was well tolerated in our Phase 1/1b clinical trial. Sixteen percent of patients treated with AM0010 plus FOLFOX were observed to have experienced peripheral neuropathy that were reported to be Grade 1 or 2 and no patients were reported to have experienced peripheral neuropathy that were reported to be Grade 3 or 4 (severe or life-threatening). Based on medical literature, approximately 44% of PDAC patients treated with FOLFOX alone experienced treatment-related peripheral neuropathy, with up to 7% being Grade 3 or 4, as reported by the Zaanan Article. These findings indicate that the anti-inflammatory properties of AM0010 may reduce the rates and severity of peripheral neuropathy associated with FOLFOX and potentially improve tolerance to this chemotherapeutic regimen and increase the dose intensity of the AM0010 plus FOLFOX combination. Patients receiving AM0010 plus FOLFOX in our Phase 1/1b clinical trial received a median of two prior therapies, including chemotherapeutics known to be toxic to the bone marrow. As such, these patients with limited bone marrow reserve would typically be more likely to experience lower levels of erythrocytes and thrombocytes in the blood after treatment, resulting in higher rates of anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia compared to patients who had received fewer prior courses of therapy. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events are defined as severe or life-threatening events. Among 25 PDAC patients treated with AM0010 plus FOLFOX, Grade 3 or 4 adverse events experienced by two or more patients were: anemia (13 patients (52%)), thrombocytopenia (14 patients (56%)), neutropenia (nine patients (36%)), leukopenia (four patients (16%)), fatigue (four patients (16%)), dehydration (three patients (12%)), sepsis (three patients (12%)) and increases in blood bilirubin (three patients (12%)). Other adverse events experienced in only two patients (8% of patients treated) were: hypertension, vomiting and increases in blood alkaline phosphatase. 
 Twelve PDAC patients treated with AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX had elevated CA 19-9 levels and both a baseline and post-baseline measurement. Of these 12 patients, 75.0% had a reduction in CA 19-9, 58.3% had a reduction in CA 19-9 greater than 20% and 41.7% had a reduction in CA 19-9 greater than 60%. Two of these patients achieved a complete response.

 CA 19-9 Serum Levels in PDAC Patients Treated with a Combination of AM0010 and FOLFOX 
 

Ongoing Phase 3 Clinical Trial (SEQUOIA) 
 Based on the results of our Phase 1/1b clinical trial in PDAC patients, we have initiated SEQUOIA, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. In this study, AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX will be compared with FOLFOX alone, as second-line therapy in patients with PDAC that have progressed during or following a first-line gemcitabine-containing regimen. The trial design is shown in the figure below. 
Phase 3 PDAC Pivotal Clinical Trial Design Schema 
 

We plan to enroll approximately 566 PDAC patients who will be randomized by two stratifications: (i) prior gemcitabine versus prior gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and (ii) three geographic areas (North America vs. E.U. vs. Asia Pacific). Patients will receive treatment with AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX (ARM 1) or treatment with FOLFOX alone (ARM 2). Each arm will receive up to 12 cycles of FOLFOX. In the absence of tumor progression, patients in ARM 1 may continue maintenance with AM0010 alone or AM0010 + 5-FU/LV after completion of the 12 cycles of FOLFOX or FOLFOX intolerance. Overall survival is the primary endpoint with PFS, ORR and safety as secondary endpoints. 
 There will be two interim analyses. The first interim analysis was performed once at least 60 randomized PDAC patients had the opportunity to receive four months of therapy from the date of randomization. Based on the first interim analysis, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) reviewed the PK exposure for both safety and efficacy and provided a recommendation for a Go/ No Go decision to continue enrollment. The first interim analysis was conducted on March 25, 2018 and after reviewing the data on 60 patients who had reeived four moths of therapy, the DMC recommended that the study continue without modification. 
 
18 


 The second interim analysis will occur when there are at least 276 deaths (70% of the total 393 deaths needed for the final analysis) on study. Based on the second interim analysis, the DMC will recommend (i) completing enrollment, (ii) stopping for superiority of survival or (iii) discontinuing the trial. The final analysis will be conducted after 393 deaths have occurred on study. If the trial demonstrates a statistically significant survival benefit, we plan to submit a BLA for AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX as a second-line therapy in patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer. Both the second interim analysis and the final anlaysis are expected to be conducted in 2020. 
 FDAs determination of statistical significance generally indicates a finding that the success of the trial is not due to error or random chance. Subject to a number of variables and exceptions, the FDA typically expects the primary statistical analyses (on the primary endpoints) supporting the efficacy of a drug or biologic to meet the conventional level of statistical significance, which contemplates a p-value of 0.05 or less in a two-tailed test. Lower p-values for efficacy analyses lend greater evidentiary support to the credibility of the clinical trial results. 
 Generally, the FDA has stated that the most reliable method for demonstrating efficacy is to show a statistically significant improvement in a clinically meaningful endpoint in randomized controlled trials. The FDA has specifically noted that for cancer drugs and biologics, prolongation of survival (overall survival) is a common later phase efficacy endpoint that evaluates clinical benefit. In this context, the demonstration of a statistically significant improvement in overall survival can be considered to be clinically significant for a product with an acceptable toxicity profile. Thus, statistically significant differences in overall survival between a treatment and control group may provide substantial evidence of efficacy and may support the approval of a new oncology drug or biological product. 
 The FDA and European Commission have granted AM0010 Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The FDA also granted Fast Track designation for AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX as a second-line therapy in patients with pancreatic cancer. 
 AM0010 with anti-PD-1 in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
 Market size 
 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States and in the rest of the world. According to estimates by the American Cancer Society, approximately 222,500 new cases were expected to be diagnosed and approximately 155,870 people were expected to die of this disease in 2017 in the United States alone. 
 There are two types of lung cancer; non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC represents 80% to 85% of all lung cancers, is further subdivided into three distinct histological subtypes; non-squamous cell or adenocarcinoma (40% to 45%), squamous cell carcinoma (25% to 30%), and large cell carcinoma (10%). 
 The majority of lung cancer patients present with either stage IV / metastatic (57%) or stage III locally advanced (22%) disease. Of those patients presenting with metastatic disease, approximately 85% might be candidates for systemic drug therapy if they are fit and resilient (performance scores 0, 1, or 2). About 50% to 70% of NSCLC patients typically receive a second-line therapy, and approximately 25% to 35% receive a third-line therapy. 
 Treatment landscape for NSCLC 
 Until recently, first-line therapy in NSCLC consisted of platinum-based doublet regimens (e.g. carboplatin or cisplatin plus another chemotherapeutic agent such as pemetrexed or bevacizumab). The documented mOS for NSCLC patients receiving a platinum-based doublet as initial therapy is approximately 10 months. The five-year landmark survival rate for all patients with advanced NSCLC is approximately 15%. 
 
19 


 Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promising results in NSCLC across histological subtypes and lines of therapy. Initial treatment selection in the first-line setting of NSCLC is usually contingent upon tumor PD-L1 expression status. High tumor PD-L1 expression is defined as >50% of the tumor cells having PD-L1 on their cell surface. This population of patients is more likely to respond to a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor as an initial therapy for NSCLC. Low tumor PD-L1 expression is defined as 1% to 49% of the tumor cells having PD-L1 on their cell surface and non-PD-L1 expression is defined as <1% of the tumor cells having PD-L1 on their cell surface. Low PD-L1 and non-PD-L1 expressing patients are less likely to respond to a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. 
 The FDA approved pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor as first-line therapy for NSCLC patients who have a high proportion of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 (>50%). The FDA also approved pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin as first-line treatment for NSCLC patients regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression status. This accelerated approval was based on response rate and progression-free survival. Final approval is contingent on the studys overall survival readout and potentially verification in confirmatory trials. 
 Several clinical trials testing the combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors (doublets such as nivolumab plus ipilimumab or durvalumab plus tremelimumab) and immune checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy are currently underway in first-line NSCLC. 
 In the second-line setting of NSCLC, the FDA has approved both nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor) and atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) in all patients regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression status and pembrolizumab (PD-1 inhibitor) in patients with tumor PD-L1 expression. All three products were approved based on trials in patients that had failed or relapsed after initial therapy with a platinum-based doublet. In these trials of second-line NSCLC patients across PD-L1 expression status and histological subtypes, the average objective response rate was approximately 15-20%, the average disease control rate was approximately 40%, the mPFS was between 3 to 4 months and the mOS was approximately 13 months. 
 These data illustrate the obvious remaining unmet medical need to improve objective tumor response rates and overall survival of current therapies for NSCLC. In our Phase 1/1b clinical trial in NSCLC, we evaluated AM0010 as both a single agent and in combination with nivolumab or pembrolizumab and we are launching CYPRESS, a Phase 2b clinical development program in NSCLC. 
 Our clinical development of AM0010 in NSCLC 
 Current clinical data 
 The table below presents the prior treatment history and efficacy results of patients with advanced, later-stage NSCLC in our Phase 1/1b clinical trial for both AM0010 monotherapy and AM0010 in combination with either pembrolizumab or nivolumab as of October 29, 2017.

 AM0010 monotherapy 
 There were no objective responses observed in the seven heavily pre-treated NSCLC evaluable patients exposed to AM0010 monotherapy in the Phase 1/1b clinical trial. However, the mOS was 15.4 months (median follow up of 30.7 months with a range between 9.9 and 37.7 months) and the landmark one year survival rate was 55.6%. This is promising given the mOS for nivolumab, a standard of care in the second-line setting for NSCLC, is 9.2 months for squamous NSCLC and 12.0 months for non-squamous NSCLC and the one year survival is 42% and 52% for these subtypes, respectively.

AM0010 and PD-1 inhibitors 
 There were objective responses observed in the 27 NSCLC evaluable patients exposed to AM0010 plus either nivolumab (n=22, median number of prior therapies 2, range 1-3) or pembrolizumab (n=5, median number of 
 
21 


  prior therapies 2, range 0-5) in the Phase 1/1b clinical trial. There were nine (41%) partial responders in the AM0010 plus nivolumab cohort and two (40%) partial responders in the AM0010 plus pembrolizumab cohort. The mPFS in the AM0010 plus nivolumab cohort has not been reached while the mPFS in the AM0010 plus pembrolizumab cohort is 11 months. For comparison purposes, the mPFS for pembrolizumab in the second-line setting was 3.0 months in a study reported in the Garon Article. The mOS in the pembrolizumab cohort has been reached in the first quarter of 2018, and will be disclosed at an upcoming medical meeting, but the mOS for the nivolumab cohort has not yet been reached. We are encouraged by overall survival data we have seen this far, and by the tail on the overall survival curve which is indicative of long-term survivors. For comparison purposes, a one-year survival of 51% was reported for patients treated with nivolumab by Borghaei et al., Nivolumab Versus Docetaxel in Advanced Nonsquamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer, The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). 
 Overall Survival of NSCLC Patients Treated with a Combination of AM0010 and Nivolumab 
 

Importantly, we have observed ORRs for AM0010 in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors that are higher than reported for immune checkpoint inhibitors alone at all levels of PD-L1 expression (see table below). For patients with tumors that highly expressed PD-L1 (>50%), the ORR was 80% (vs. 44% as reported in the Garon Article for pembrolizumab monotherapy in the second-line setting of high tumor PD-L1 expression). Of particular interest is a 40% ORR (n=15, 6 PRs) in patients with low to no tumor PD-L1 expression (<50%) and a 33% ORR (n=12, 4 PRs) in the tumor non-PD-L1 expressing (<1%) patients. In studies of pembrolizumab alone in tumor non-PD-L1 expressing patients the ORR was approximately 9%. 
 These findings indicate that AM0010 may overcome non-PD-L1 mediated immune escape mechanisms and potentially improve the response rates in patient populations resistant or refractory to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors.

 It has been reported by Tumeh et al., Liver Metastasis and Treatment Outcome with Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody in Patients with Melanoma and NSCLC, Cancer Immunology Research (2017), that the presence of metastases in the liver worsens the prognosis and reduces the response and progression-free survival of cancer patients treated with a variety of therapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors. In our Phase 1/1b clinical 
 
22 


  trial of AM0010 combined with either pembrolizumab or nivolumab in NSCLC, eight patients had liver metastasis, which is the expected incidence reported in other studies. Of those eight patients, five had a partial response. In addition, these eight patients had a combined total number of 18 target secondary lesions in the liver, of which 16 had a reduction in size. More importantly, 14 of these 16 lesions showed more than a 50% reduction in size (see figure below). These findings indicate that treatment with AM0010 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors may have a therapeutic impact on liver metastases and potentially improve clinical outcomes. 
 Change in Measurable Secondary Liver Lesions in NSCLC Patients Treated with AM0010 in Combination with Pembrolizumab or Nivolumab (n=18 lesions) 
 

Based on these results we will launch our Phase 2b program in NSCLC, CYPRESS, which will initially include two randomized clinical trials across levels of PD-L1 expression and lines of treatment. We plan to begin enrolling patients in these trials in the first quarter of 2018 and given the open label design of the trials we expect to have preliminary response data in a meaningful number of patients in both trials by late 2018, which we expect will inform our regulatory strategy and next steps in the development of AM0010 in NSCLC. We also expect to have additional data from both trials in 2019. 
 The first clinical trial, CYPRESS-1 will compare the safety and efficacy of AM0010 plus pembrolizumab to standard of care pembrolizumab alone as front-line therapy for patients with high tumor PD-L1 expression (>50%). The second clinical trial, CYPRESS-2 will compare the safety and efficacy of AM0010 plus nivolumab to standard of care nivolumab alone in the second-line setting (one prior therapy that was not a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor) in patients with low tumor PD-L1 expression (<50%). Based on the results of CYPRESS-1 and CYPRESS-2 and the evolving treatment landscape for NSCLC, we may expand the CYPRESS program to include additional studies that could support registration of AM0010, as well as studies that could include our pipeline anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (AM0001). 
 It has been reported that lower than expected response rates to immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. nivolumab, pembrolizumab) across a number of tumor types might be explained by tumor mutational burden (TMB), which is the total number of mutations per coding area of a tumor genome (Yarchoan et al., Tumor Mutational Burden and Response Rate to PD-1 Inhibition, The New England Journal of Medicine (2017)). 
 We evaluated the TMB of tumors from NSCLC patients in our Phase 1/1b clinical trial who received AM0010 in combination with nivolumab and were available for testing. The figure below illustrates the results of that assessment relative to TMB status and PD-L1 expression status. For the four subjects with low TMB and high PD-L1 expression the ORR was 75% and the DCR was 100%. For the four subjects with low TMB and low PD-L1 expression the ORR 50% and the DCR was 100%.

Note: High/Low TMB stratification (243) used in Carbone et al, NEJM 2017 
 These findings may indicate that AM0010 in combination with standard of care anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors is a potential approach to the poorer responding low TMB population regardless of PD-L1 expression status.

 For later-stage RCC patients receiving AM0010 monotherapy in the Phase 1/1b clinical trial, the ORR was 25%, the DCR was 56.3% and mPFS was 1.9 months. For comparison purposes, nivolumab studies in second-line RCC reported an average ORR of about 20%, a DCR of between 57% and 65% and a mPFS of between 2.7 months and 4.2 months. 
 For later-stage RCC patients receiving AM0010 plus pembrolizumab in the Phase 1/1b clinical trial, the mPFS was 16.7 months and the mOS has not yet been reached after a median follow-up time of 29.4 months. For RCC patients receiving AM0010 plus nivolumab, the mPFS and mOS has not yet been reached after a median follow-up time of 13.8 months. For comparison purposes, nivolumab studies in second-line RCC reported an average mPFS of between 2.7 months and 4.2 months and mOS of between 18.2 and 25.5 months. 
 We are developing a plan to study AM0010 plus an immune checkpoint inhibitor in RCC. Therapy for treatment-naïve RCC is evolving. For example, in a recent study, combination immunotherapy (nivolumab plus ipilimumab) proved superior to the established standard of care targeted monotherapy (sunitinib). In addition, therapy for relapse RCC is also changing. As nivolumab plus ipilimumab becomes more commonly used in treatment-naïve patients, fewer immune-based therapies may be used in the relapse setting while currently approved targeted therapies are used in the post-front-line setting including sunitinib, axitinib and everolimus, becoming more prevalent. 
 Given the evolving therapeutic landscape for treatment-naïve and relapse RCC patients and the clinical and safety data obtained in our Phase 1/1b clinical trial, there are multiple potential clinical development approaches for AM0010 in both the first-line and second-line settings. For example, in the RCC first-line setting AM0010 could be combined with nivolumab and ipilimumab (vs. nivolumab + ipilimumab), in combination with nivolumab alone (vs. sunitinib) or in combination with pembrolizumab alone (vs. sunitinib). In the RCC second-line setting, AM0010 could potentially be combined with approved SOC targeted therapies and compared to those therapies alone. We expect that the evolving landscape for treatment naïve and relapse RCC patients will change in the first half of 2018, which will allow us to settle on a development plan for AM0010 in RCC. As a result, we expect to commence a combination trial with AM0010 and a standard of care therapy in RCC in the second half of 2018. 
 AM0010 for the Treatment of Additional Cancer Indications 
 As part of our Phase 1/1b clinical trial, AM0010 has been studied in combination with pembrolizumab in melanoma patients whose tumors are resistant or refractory to immune checkpoint blockade and who failed a median number of three prior therapies. The one-year survival rate was 57% and the mOS is 16.7 months with median follow-up time of 24.6 months and a range between 1.2 and 27.4 months. We are encouraged by the tail on the overall survival curve which is indicative of long term survivors. As a comparison, a recent study reports a mOS of 8 months in patients who received pembrolizumab in combination with ipilimumab after they progressed on prior treatment with ipilimumab and anti-PD-1 monotherapies (Kirchberger et al., Combined Low-Dose Ipilimumab and Pembrolizumab After Sequential Ipilimumab and Pembrolizumab Failure in Advanced Melanoma, European Journal of Cancer (2016)).

AM0010 monotherapy was studied in microsatellite stable CRC patients who had a median number of four prior therapies. The mOS was 11 months, as indicated in the figure below. These data appear favorable to the reported mOS of 7.1 months for LONSURF (Mayer et al., Randomized Trial of TAS-102 for Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, The New England Journal of Medicine (2015)), a combination of trifluridine and tipiracil, which was approved by the FDA in 2015 for the treatment of metastatic CRC in third or later line of treatment.

We are evaluating Phase 2 clinical trials to study AM0010, as a monotherapy or in a combination, in these indications in the future. 
 Manufacturing 
 We currently do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third party CMOs to produce our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain agreements with our manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates. 
 
26 


 We have engaged CMOs to manufacture AM0010 and AM0001 drug product for preclinical and clinical use. Additional CMOs are used to label, package and distribute drug product for preclinical and clinical use. We obtain our supplies from these CMOs on a purchase order basis and do not have a long-term supply arrangements in place. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply. For all of our drug candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services prior to seeking regulatory approval. 
 Commercialization Plan 
 We currently have exclusive global development, marketing and commercialization rights for AM0010 and AM0001. We plan to continue to develop and seek regulatory approval for the use of these products in various indications. As our products advance through the pipeline, our commercial plans may change. Clinical data, the size of the development programs, the size of the target market, the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence our commercialization strategy. We may enter into strategic relationships with biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to realize the full value of our immunotherapies and their use in combination with other treatments to benefit patients. 
Intellectual Property 
 Introduction and Overview 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patent and other proprietary protections of our commercially important technology and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products will depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that protect these activities. We seek to protect proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. 
 To attempt to achieve this objective, a strategic focus for us has been to identify and license key patents and patent applications that serve to enhance our intellectual property and technology position. However, with respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial activities or that such existing or patents that may be granted will not be susceptible to a successful validity challenge by a third party. 
 Our intellectual property strategy seeks to provide multiple layers of protection for our product candidates, including: (1) patent rights with claims directed to core active ingredients used in our products; (2) patent rights directed to methods of treatment for therapeutic applications of our product candidates; (3) patent rights directed to pharmaceutical forms of the product candidates; and (4) patent rights directed to innovative manufacturing processes. 
 As of March 15, 2018, our patent portfolio includes 85 issued patents (10 of which are in the United States) and 115 pending patent applications (19 of which are in the United States) which we either own or for which we have an exclusive commercial license (either in its entirety or within our field of use), as is more fully described below. 
 Our lead product candidate, AM0010, is a pharmaceutical formulation comprising mono- and di-PEGylated forms of IL-10. The foundation of our IL-10 patent estate is based on intellectual property licensed to us pursuant to an Exclusive Patent License Agreement effective December 12, 2012, with Merck, Sharp & Dohme Corporation (Merck), as amended, (the Merck Agreement). We exclusively license three patent families pursuant 
 
27 


  to the Merck Agreement, referred to as ARMO-001, ARMO-002 and ARMO-003. In the ARMO-001 patent family, as of March 15, 2018, we license three issued patents and two pending patent applications in the United States, and 15 issued patents and no pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. The foreign jurisdictions where patents have issued in the ARMO-001 family include Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 
 In the ARMO-002 patent family, as of March 15, 2018, we license three issued patents and one pending patent application in the United States, and 27 issued patents and three pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. The foreign jurisdictions where patents have issued or are pending in the ARMO-002 family include Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 
 In the ARMO-003 patent family, as of March 15, 2018, we license three issued patents and one pending patent application in the United States, and 27 issued patents and three pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. The foreign jurisdictions where patents have issued or are pending in the ARMO-003 family include Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, The Czech Republic, Denmark, European Patent Office, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The type of protection provided by the patents and pending patent applications includes protection related to methods of treatment (use), composition of matter, and methods of manufacturing. In general, the patent terms run 20 years from the earliest non-provisional priority application to which priority is claimed in each patent family. The normal statutory term of the United States and foreign patents and applications will expire on September 28, 2021 for the ARMO-001 patent family, September 27, 2027 for the ARMO-002 patent family, and December 15, 2029 for the ARMO-003 patent family. Certain U.S. patents in these patent families are entitled to day-by-day extensions of term and may have a later expiration date. For more information about the Merck Agreement, see the section below entitled Merck Agreement. 
 As of March 15, 2018, we also own pending patent applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions with claims directed to compositions of matter of IL-10 variant polypeptides, methods of using IL-10 in combination therapies, including PEGylated forms of IL-10, as well as to IL-10 variant polypeptides that retain IL-10 activity, for treating various diseases and disorders. The foreign jurisdictions in which we own such pending patent applications include Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, South Africa, and South Korea. Several of these pending patent applications are in the international phase as Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications, which preserve the ability to pursue foreign rights in the countries listed above (in addition to other PCT-member countries). In the event that any patents issue based on these patent applications, such patents would be expected to expire between 2034 and 2038, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
 As of March 15, 2018, we have one issued U.S. patent, one pending U.S. application and five pending foreign patent applications with claims directed to methods for characterizing IL-10 species. The foreign jurisdictions in which we own such pending patent applications include Australia, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong and Japan. As of March 15, 2018, we own one pending U.S. and five foreign patent applications relating to processes for refolding IL-10 from inclusion bodies arising from recombinant expression in bacterial cells, respectively. The jurisdictions in which we own such pending patent applications include Australia, Canada, China, Europe, and Japan. In the event that patents issue based on these patent applications, such patents would be expected to expire between 2034 and 2035, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
 Additionally, as of March 15, 2018, we have one U.S. patent application and nine foreign applications with composition of matter claims directed to IL-15 variant peptides and methods of using such variant peptides for treating various diseases, disorders or conditions. The foreign jurisdictions in which we own such pending patent applications include Australia, Canada, China Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and South Africa. We own another patent application with claims directed to PEGylated forms of IL-15 and methods of 
 
28 


  using such variant peptides for treating various diseases, disorders or conditions. As of March 15, 2018, this application is in the PCT international stage of prosecution. In the event that patents issue based on these patent applications, such patents would be expected to expire in 2035 and 2036, respectively, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
 Additionally, as of March 15, 2018, we own a PCT patent application directed to clinical applications of IL-12 in combination with IL-10, including PEGylated forms of IL-10. In the event that patents issue based on this patent application, such patents would be expected to expire in 2036, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
 Patent Term Adjustments Arising From Patent Office Administrative Delays 
 Patents are granted on a territorial basis and the term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the first non-provisional application to which priority is claimed. In the United States, the term of a patent may be extended due to patent term adjustment in the United States Patent and Trademark Office pursuant to 35 USC 154, which law is intended to compensate a patentee for administrative delays in the patent prosecution process caused by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Alternatively, the term of a patent may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. When applicable, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents owned, controlled or exclusively licensed to us. 
Patent Term Extensions Arising from Regulatory Delays 
 Patent term extensions may also be granted arising from delays generated by compliance with regulatory processes. In the United States, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for a patent term restoration pursuant to 35 USC 156 of up to five years under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 also referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The length of the patent term restoration is calculated by the USPTO based on the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. It should be noted that in contrast to extensions pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 154 for administrative delays at the USPTO, patent term extension under 35 U.S.C. 156 for regulatory delays at the FDA does not extend to the full scope of the patent claims, but only to the extent they cover the approved product and approved indication upon which the extension was based. In other words, the Hatch-Waxman act does not extend all claims of the subject patent, and the practice of those claims by third parties after the original patent term, as extended pursuant to 35 USC 154, expires may not constitute infringement. A patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Moreover, only one patent encompassing an approved drug or method of treatment using that drug, may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be restored once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended one time for one approved product. Moreover, once a product is approved, it cannot serve as the basis for patent term extension of another patent at a later time, even if the product is approved for a different indication. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA), we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents owned, controlled or exclusively licensed to us covering our product candidates and their methods of use, to the extent the law allows. 
 Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. Depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors, we intend to seek patent term extensions on a country-by-country basis or territorial basis for patents owned, controlled or exclusively licensed to us covering our product candidates and their methods of use, as appropriate. Beyond the statute connecting patent term and FDA approval, the two are unrelated. Patent issuance does not affect FDA approval and FDA approval does not affect issuance of a patent. 
Trade Secrets 
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into agreements containing industry standard 
 
29 


  provisions of confidentiality with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. 
 However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. While we have confidence in our employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and security systems, it is possible that agreements with these individuals or entities and our security measures may be breached and resulting loss of such trade secrets resulting in harm to the company that may not be remedied under existing laws. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. Additionally, in the event that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, we may become involved in disputes relating to such intellectual property which may affect our rights in intellectual property arising from the activity of our consultants, contractors or collaborators. 
 Merck Agreement 
 Pursuant to the Merck Agreement, we obtained a worldwide exclusive royalty bearing license under specified patents and know-how to develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing PEGylated human IL-10 polypeptide for all therapeutic purposes in humans. Under the Merck Agreement, we are obligated to use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed product. 
 In consideration for the license agreement, we paid Merck an initial license fee and we will be required to pay milestone payments up to $11.3 million upon the occurrence of certain events. Through December 31, 2017, milestone payments totaling $1.45 million have been paid to Merck. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the Merck Agreement will continue in effect on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties. We are also obligated to pay Merck a royalty on net sales of licensed products on a country-by-country basis. Our obligation to pay royalties is based upon single digit percentages of royalties of annual net sales on licensed products, based upon the amount of such net sales. Our obligation to pay royalties expires on product-by-product and country-by-country basis, upon the last to occur of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent right under the Merck Agreement covering a licensed product in such country, (i) or the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country. We have the right to unilaterally terminate the Merck Agreement with advance written notice to Merck. Merck has the right to terminate the Merck Agreement in the event we undergo a change of control and our successor decides not to continue the development and/or commercialization of the licensed product. The Merck Agreement may also be terminated by either party for cause if there is an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or upon the bankruptcy of the other party. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions among others. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also 
 
30 


  prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic drugs. Generic drugs for the treatment of cancer and the other indications on which we currently plan to initially focus are currently on the market, and additional drugs are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If we obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic drugs. 
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. There are other companies working to develop immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer including divisions of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies of various sizes. These companies are developing different types of immunotherapies, including monoclonal antibodies, adoptive cell transfer, cytokines, oncolytic viruses and vaccines. 
 To our knowledge there are no other IL-10 cytokine programs in clinical development for oncology. Our initial targeted indications for AM0010 (PEG-IL-10) include PDAC, NSCLC and RCC. Treatment for these patients has historically been chemotherapies and targeted therapies. More recently, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co. and Roche have received approval for an immune checkpoint inhibitors for NSCLC, Bristol-Myers Squibb has also received approval for an immune checkpoint inhibitor for RCC. Several checkpoint inhibitors are also under investigation in pancreatic cancer. There are increasing efforts in clinical development to combine different therapies to improve patient outcomes in these indications. We believe that if AM0010 were approved in combination with FOLFOX for the treatment of pancreatic cancer or with immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of NSCLC or RCC it would face competition from these standard of care approaches and other investigational drugs being tested in combination therapies. 
 For AM0001, our anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, AstraZeneca PLC, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Merck, Merck KGaA (which operates its healthcare business in the United States and Canada as EMD Serono) and Roche Holding Ltd all have marketed products targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 that are approved for the treatment of cancers. Additionally, a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have products in early to mid-stage clinical development targeting PD-1 or PD-L1.
With regards to our additional preclinical pipeline, there are a number of programs of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that can be considered competitors. 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 Drug Development and Approval in the U.S. 
 As a biopharmaceutical company operating in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and by other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The FDA regulates our products under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), and their implementing regulations. Under the FDCA, new drugs other than biological products (biologics) that are marketed in the United States generally must be FDA-approved under a New Drug Application (NDA). For biologics, under section 351 of the PHSA an FDA-approved Biologics License Application (BLA) is required prior to marketing in the United States. Biologics (other than biological medical devices) meet the FDCA definition of drugs and, 
 
31 


  consequently, are subject to FDCA requirements for drugs, except that they are licensed under the PHSA rather than approved through an NDA. The applicable provisions of the FDCA, the PHSA, and the implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for preclinical and clinical testing, product development, manufacture, licensure, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, reporting, import, export, advertising, and promotion of our products and product candidates. 
 The process for obtaining regulatory approval to market a biologic is expensive, often takes many years, and can vary substantially based on the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidates involved. The steps required before a biologic may be licensed for marketing of an indication in the United States generally include: 
 

 | Preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests;
--+-----------------------------------------------


 | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity, and potency (including efficacy) of the product for its intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Submission to the FDA of a BLA; and
--+------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the BLA.
--+------------------------------------

 Preclinical Studies. Before testing any investigational biopharmaceutical in human subjects in the United States, a company must generate extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing typically includes laboratory evaluation of product composition and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. In addition, concurrent with clinical trials, companies sometimes complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug. Animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDAs Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and the United States Department of Agricultures Animal Welfare Act. 
 IND Application. Human clinical trials conducted in the United States cannot commence until an IND application is submitted and becomes effective. A company must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND, and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in initial clinical trials in human volunteers. Unless the FDA raises concerns, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. At any time the FDA may stop clinical trials by placing them on clinical hold because of concerns about the safety of the product being tested, or for other reasons. 
 Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients, under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with the FDAs Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of clinical trials. GCP requirements are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. 
 Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed, approved, and conducted under the auspices of an Institutional Review Board, or IRB. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects, complying with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of adverse events. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another: 
 

 | Phase 1 clinical trials include the initial administration of the investigational drug to humans, typically to a small group of healthy human subjects, but occasionally to a group of patients with the targeted
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
32 


 
disease or disorder. Phase 1 clinical trials generally are intended to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. Sponsors sometimes designate their Phase 1 clinical trials as Phase 1a or Phase 1b. Phase 1b clinical trials are typically aimed at confirming dosing, pharmacokinetics and safety in larger number of patients. Some Phase 1b studies evaluate biomarkers or surrogate markers that may be associated with efficacy in patients with specific types of diseases.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2 clinical trials generally are controlled studies that involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population, and are designed to develop data regarding the products effectiveness, to determine dose response and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained and are intended to gather additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the drugs overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide a basis for physician labeling. Generally, Phase 3 clinical development programs consist of expanded studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the product at the proposed dosing regimen.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials can sometimes be combined or collapsed into a single study protocol, such as when optimal dosing and other questions typically explored in Phase 2 clinical trials are already resolved and where the Phase 2 clinical trial is designed sufficiently to yield adequate and well-controlled clinical data on which the FDA can base an approval decision. 
 A study sponsor is required to register post-Phase 1 clinical trials with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and to submit certain details for public posting on its clinicaltrials.gov database. Registration must occur not later than 21 days after the first patient is enrolled, and the submission must include descriptive information, recruitment information, location and contact information, and other relevant administrative data. Generally within one year of a trials completion, outcomes data and related information must be submitted to the NIH for online dissemination. A BLA, BLA supplement, and certain other submissions to the FDA require certification of compliance with these clinical trials database requirements. 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), BLAs must generally contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers from PREA requirements, however, including waivers for certain products that are not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients. Products with orphan drug designation are exempt from PREA requirements for orphan-designated indications, and no formal waiver process is required. 
 The sponsoring company, the FDA, or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Further, success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval. 
 BLA Submission and Review 
 The results of the preclinical testing and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product and proposed labeling for the product, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product candidate for a proposed indication. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, the fees payable to the FDA when submitting a BLA, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products, can be substantial. Products with only orphan drug-designated indications are exempt from paying the BLA application fee and, under some circumstances, the program fee. 
 
33 


 Each BLA submitted to the FDA for approval is typically reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days following submission of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. If the FDA finds the BLA sufficiently complete, the FDA will file the BLA, thus triggering a full review of the application. 
 FDA performance goals (which are target dates) and other aspirational measures of agency performance to which the agency, Congressional representatives, and industry agree through negotiations that occur every five years, generally provide for action on original BLA applications within 10 months of the 60-day filing date. The FDA is not expected to meet those target dates for all applications, and the deadline may be extended in certain circumstances, such as when the applicant submits new data late in the review period. In practice, the review process can also be significantly extended by FDA if it requests for additional information or clarification. In some circumstances, FDA can expedite the review of biologics deemed to qualify for priority review, such as those intended to treat serious or life threatening conditions that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. In those cases, the targeted action date is six months from the 60-day filing date. As part of its review, the FDA may refer the BLA to an advisory committee composed of outside experts for evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. Although the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, the agency has usually followed such recommendations. 
 FDA may designate a product as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Breakthrough designation provides BLA sponsors with greater interactions with the FDA, and the FDA may initiate a rolling review of individual BLA sections before the application is submitted in full. The FDA may also take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including: providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design efficient clinical trials. 
 The outcome of the FDAs review, even if generally favorable, may not be an actual approval but instead a complete response letter communicating the FDAs decision not to approve the application, outlining the deficiencies in the BLA, and identifying what information and/or data (including additional preclinical or clinical data) are required before the application can be approved. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA still does not meet the standards for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we do. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will also inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the facilities comply with the FDAs current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if applicable statutory or regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information, which can delay the approval process. 
 FDA approval of any application may include many delays or never be granted. If a product is approved, the approval may impose limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed and may require that warning statements be included in the product labeling. The FDA also may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. Additionally, the FDA may require post-approval commitments, including the completion within a specified time period of additional clinical trials, which often are referred to as Phase 4 studies or post-marketing requirements. Obtaining regulatory approval often takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources, and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials.

 Biosimilar Competition and Regulatory Exclusivity in the U.S. 
 In 2010, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) was enacted, creating a statutory pathway for licensure, or approval, of biological products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, reference biological products licensed under the Public Health Service Act. 
 Under the BPCIA, innovator manufacturers of original reference biological products are granted 12 years of exclusive use before biosimilar versions of such products can be licensed for marketing in the United States. This means that the FDA may not approve an application for a biosimilar version of a reference biological product until 12 years after the date of approval of the reference biological product, with a potential six-month extension of exclusivity if certain pediatric studies are conducted and the results are reported to the FDA. A biosimilar application may be submitted four years after the date of licensure of the reference biological product, but the FDA cannot approve the application until the full exclusivity period has expired. This 12-year exclusivity period operates independently from other protections that may apply to biosimilar competitors, including patents that we hold for our products. Additionally, the BPCIA establishes procedures by which the biosimilar applicant must provide information about its application and product to the reference product sponsor, and by which information about potentially relevant patents is shared and litigation over patents may proceed in advance of approval. The BPCIA also provides a period of exclusivity for the first biosimilar to be determined by the FDA to be interchangeable with the reference product. 
 Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs and biological products intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or supplemental BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the common identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are publicly disclosed by the FDA. 
 Orphan drug designation does notby itselfconvey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug or biologic for the indication for which it has been designated, the product is entitled to an orphan exclusivity period in which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years. 
 Exceptions to the seven-year exclusivity period may apply in limited circumstances, such as where the sponsor of a different version of the product is able to demonstrate that its product is clinically superior to the approved orphan drug product. This exclusivity does not prevent a competitor from obtaining approval to market a different product that treats the same disease or condition, or the same product to treat a different disease or condition. The FDA can revoke a products orphan drug exclusivity under certain circumstances, including when the holder of the approved orphan drug application is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet patient needs. Orphan exclusivity operates independently from other regulatory exclusivities and other protections against biosimilar competition, including patents that we hold for our products. 
 A sponsor of a product application that has received an orphan drug designation is also granted tax incentives for clinical research undertaken to support the application. In addition, the FDA will typically coordinate with the sponsor on research study design for an orphan drug and may exercise its discretion to grant marketing approval on the basis of more limited product safety and efficacy data than would ordinarily be required, based on the limited size of the applicable patient population. 
 Fast Track Designation 
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which 
 
35 


  demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a fast track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsors request. 
 In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have more frequent interactions with the FDA, the agency may initiate review of sections of a fast track products BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDAs PDUFA review period for a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the BLA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the agency believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 FDA Post-Approval Requirements 
 Both before and after the FDA approves a product, the manufacturer and the holder of the BLA for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a productincluding adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, issues with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirementsmay result in: mandatory revisions to the approved labeling; the addition of new safety information to the labeling; the imposition of additional post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or the imposition of distribution-related or other restrictions under a REMS program. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for ongoing compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements on the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) and state laws, which collectively regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production, distribution. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production, distribution and quality control to maintain cGMP and statutory compliance. 
 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products that are placed on the market. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved, and approved drugs may generally be promoted only for their approved indications, although sponsors may engage in non-promotional, balanced communication regarding off-label use under certain conditions. Promotional claims must also be consistent with the products FDA-approved label, including claims related to safety and effectiveness. The FDA and other federal agencies also closely regulate the promotion of drugs in specific contexts such as direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and education activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. 
 
36 


 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Other potential consequences of regulatory non-compliance include, among other things: 
 

 | Restrictions on, or suspensions of, the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Interruption of production processes, including the shutdown of manufacturing facilities or production lines or the imposition of new manufacturing requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The issuance of Warning Letters, or other enforcement letters;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | Holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------


 | Refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Injunctions or the imposition of civil and/or criminal penalties.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 Other U.S. Regulatory Matters 
 Our current and future clinical research, manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of Treasury and state and local governments. For instance, products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 Activities governed by U.S. regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA include the following examples. 
 Pricing and Reimbursement of U.S. Medicinal Products 
 Our ability to successfully commercialize products for which we receive regulatory approval depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third party payors, including, in the United States, governmental payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and other private health insurers. 
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to profitably sell our products for which we receive regulatory approval. We expect to experience pricing pressure in the United States in connection with the sale of products for which we receive regulatory approval due to these 
 
37 


  cost containment policies of managed care organizations, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative proposals. We anticipate that the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. 
 In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products for which we receive regulatory approval will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products for which we receive regulatory approval to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. 
 Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products for which we receive regulatory approval. Even with studies, our products for which we receive regulatory approval may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than other products, and third party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates that we commercialize, in whole or in part. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. For example, third party payors have started to require discounts and/or exclusivity arrangements with some drug manufacturers in exchange for including a specific product on their formularies. Any such requirements could have a negative impact on revenues from sales of our products for which we receive regulatory approval. 
 The U.S. federal government provides health insurance for people who are 65 or older, and certain people with disabilities or certain conditions irrespective of their age, through the Medicare program. Medicaid is a health insurance program for low-income children, families, pregnant women, and people with disabilities that is jointly funded by the federal and state governments, but administered by the states. In general, state Medicaid programs are required to cover drugs and biologicals of manufacturers that participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, although such drugs and biologicals may be subject to prior authorization or other utilization controls. 
 Private payors have their own processes for determining whether or not a drug or biological will be covered, often based on the available medical literature. They also use a variety of utilization management techniques designed to control costs, including requiring pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers or patients that use such therapies. We cannot predict whether any cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future. The announcement or adoption of these measures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for products for which we receive regulatory approval in the U.S. and to operate profitably. 
 Payors also are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. It may be difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payors to cover our products for which we receive regulatory approval. 
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental programs impose obligations to report pricing figures to the federal government. If we participate in these programs, we will be subject to these price reporting and other compliance obligations. Other programs impose limits on the price we will be permitted to charge certain entities for our products for which we receive regulatory approval. Statutory or regulatory changes or binding guidance regarding these programs and their requirements could negatively affect the coverage and 
 
38 


  reimbursement by these programs of products for which we receive regulatory approval and could negatively impact our results of operations. 
 In addition, in order to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, a manufacturer also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Under this program, the manufacturer is obligated to make its covered drugs (biologics or innovator drugs) available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, Public Health Service, and Coast Guard, that is no higher than the statutory federal ceiling price. Failure to timely submit the pricing required under the VA FSS program or submission of false information under the program could result in civil monetary penalties. In addition, if we determine that the price points submitted to the VA under this program were incorrect, we have an obligation to restate the pricing and we are liable for any overpayments the government made as a result of our incorrect prices. Pursuant to regulations issued by the DoD TRICARE Management Activity, now the Defense Health Agency, to implement Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, each of our covered drugs will be subject to quarterly rebates for prescriptions dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE network retail pharmacies. The formula for determining the rebate is based on the price points that are required to be calculated by us under the Veterans Health Care Act. The requirements under the FSS and DoD TRICARE programs could reduce the revenue we may generate from any products that are commercialized in the future and could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 U.S. Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and other Healthcare Laws and Regulations 
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors are and will be subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may impact, among other things, our arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare professionals who participate in our clinical research programs, healthcare professionals and others who purchase, recommend or prescribe our approved products, and our proposed sales, marketing, distribution, and education programs. The U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation, the following: 
 

 | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, arrangement for or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federally funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The government can establish a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute without proving that a person or entity had actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The federal civil False Claims Act, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through qui tam actions, prohibits individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of federal funds, and knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Criminal prosecution is also possible for making or presenting a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
39 


 
 | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which, among other things, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;

 | Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that impose similar restrictions and may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs, comply with the pharmaceutical industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians and other health care providers. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers, and restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. Some states and cities require identification or licensing of sales representatives. In addition, there are state health information privacy and data breach notification laws, which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus requiring additional compliance efforts.

 Once we have an approved and marketed product, we will be required to spend substantial time and money to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. 
 Even then, governmental authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Violations of these laws can subject us to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions including imprisonment, monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, and exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations. Moreover, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state laws and regulations, proposed and implemented, that could impact our future operations and business. The extent to which future legislation or regulations, if any, relating to healthcare fraud and abuse laws or enforcement, may be enacted or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business remains uncertain.

 Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
 In March 2010, the ACA was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things: (i) introduced a new average manufacturer price definition for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and not generally dispensed through retail community pharmacies; (ii) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and expanded rebate liability from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well; (iii) established an annual fee that pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs must pay to the federal government; (iv) expanded the list of covered entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; and (v) established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. 
 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Moreover, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted on December 22, 2017, and includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace additional elements of the ACA. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA, the repeal of the individual mandate, and any additional repeal and replacement efforts may have on our business but expect that the ACA, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our existing products that we successfully commercialize or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved. In addition to the ACA, there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third party payors to keep healthcare costs down while expanding individual healthcare benefits. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent laws, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Additional changes that may affect our business include the expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for physicians under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, which will first affect physician payment in 2019. At this time it is unclear how the introduction of the Medicare quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement. Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for 
 
41 


  their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and federal and state bills, including some that have been enacted into law, designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. 
 We expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs, once regulatory approval is obtained. 
 Cybersecurity 
 We are dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure, and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store, and transmit confidential information (including but not limited to intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personal information). It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and as a result we manage a number of third party business partners and vendors who have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of third party vendors with whom we contract, and the large amounts of confidential information stored on those systems, make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third party vendors, and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties. 
 Significant disruptions of our information technology systems or security breaches could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information (including trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personal information), and could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us. For example, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our patients or employees, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Security breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent service interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business. 
 Anti-Corruption and Trade Controls Laws 
 We are subject to U.S. and foreign Anti-Corruption and Trade Controls Laws. Anti-Corruption Laws prohibit companies and persons acting on their behalf from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from persons in the public or private sector. Trade Laws restrict the export or transfer of certain controlled equipment, materials, software, and technology as well as certain types of transactions with certain restricted parties or sanctioned countries. Our current activities and potential international expansion inherently involve the risk of violating applicable Anti-Corruption and Trade Laws, which may lead to civil and/or criminal penalties and other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, brand, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Data Protection Laws and Regulations 
 We are subject to federal, state, and foreign data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, 
 
42 


  including data breach notification laws, health information privacy laws, and consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. Outside of the United States, data protection laws, including the European Union Directive 95/46/EC (the EU Data Protection Directive) and member state implementing legislation, may also apply to health-related and other personal information that we obtain relating to data subjects that reside outside of the United States. For example, the EU Data Protection Directive imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to process health-related and other personal information of EU data subjects, including in relation to collection, analysis and transfer. In May 2018, the recently-approved EU General Data Protection Regulation will replace the current EU Data Protection Directive and introduce new data protection requirements in the EU, as well as substantial fines for breaches of the data protection requirements. 
 Failure to comply with U.S. and foreign data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation, breach of contract claims and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. 
 European Union Marketing Authorizations 
 In the European Union, marketing authorization for a medicinal product can be obtained through a centralized, decentralized, or mutual recognition or national procedure. 
 In accordance with the centralized procedure, the applicant can submit a single marketing MAA to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). When granted, a centralized marketing authorization that permits the marketing of a product in all 28 EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association, or EFTA, States (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products, medicinal products derived from certain biotechnological processes, advanced therapy medicinal products and certain other medicinal products containing a new active substance for the treatment of certain diseases, and is optional for certain other products, including medicinal products that are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public or animal health at EU level. 
 Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. 
 A mutual recognition procedure exists that is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. 
 Medicinal products authorized in the European Union may be subject to post-authorization obligations, including the obligation to conduct Phase 4 clinical trials. 
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity in the EU 
 Products authorized as orphan medicinal products in the European Union are entitled to benefits additional to those granted to innovative medicinal products. 
 In accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if: (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the incentives derived from orphan medicinal product status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there 
 
43 


  exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. 
 An application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 Products authorized in the European Union as orphan medicinal products are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity. The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product during the 10-year period of market exclusivity for the same therapeutic indication at any time if: 
 

 | The second applicant can establish in its application that its product, although similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EU New Active Substance Exclusivity 
 In the EU, new active substances qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity prevents generic applicants from referencing the innovators data to apply for a generic marketing authorization for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovators data may be referenced. For an additional two years, no generic medicinal product may be placed on the market in the EU. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 Clinical Trials in the EU 
 In the EU, the conduct of clinical trials is governed by Directive 2001/20/EC which imposes obligations and procedures that are similar to those provided in applicable US laws. The EU GCP and GLP standards must also be respected during the conduct of the trials. Prior to commencement of a clinical trial in an EU Member State, an application for authorization of a clinical trial must be submitted to the competent authority and the competent Ethics Committee of the relevant EU Member State in which the clinical trial takes place. 
 Advertising and Promotion of Medicinal Products in the EU 
 In the European Union, the advertising and promotion of our products will also be subject to EU Member States laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians and other healthcare professionals, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EU Member State legislation that may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. Advertising and promotion of our products will also be subject to EU and EU Member State industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians codes of professional conduct. These laws and codes prohibit the promotion of medicinal products in relation to which marketing authorisation has not been granted. They also require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the products Summary of Product Characteristics as approved by the competent authorities. 
 
44 


 The applicable laws at European Union level and in the individual EU Member States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. Breach of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the European Union could be penalized by, for example, administrative measures, fines and imprisonment, depending on the EU Member State. 
 Interactions between Pharmaceutical Companies and Physicians in the EU 
 Interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians or other healthcare professionals are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians codes of professional conduct in the individual EU Member States. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians or other healthcare professionals to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is generally prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU Member States. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. 
 Pricing and Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in the EU 
 The national authorities of the individual EU Member States are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices and/or reimbursement of medicinal products for human use. 
 Rest of the World Regulation 
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Employees 
 As of March 15, 2018, we have 31 full-time employees. Four of our employees have Ph.D. degrees and three of our other employees have M.D. degrees. Twenty-three of our employees are engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
