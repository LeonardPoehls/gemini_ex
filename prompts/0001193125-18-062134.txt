 Voting Agreement between Sohu and Tencent 
 Sohu, Tencent Holdings Limited (Tencent), and Sogou entered into a Voting Agreement (the Voting Agreement) that took effect upon the completion of Sogous IPO, pursuant to which Sohu and Tencent agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, (1) within three years following the completion of Sogous IPO, Sohu will vote all Class B Ordinary Shares and any Class A Ordinary Shares held by it and Tencent will vote 45,578,896 of its Class B Ordinary Shares to elect a Board of Directors consisting of seven directors, four of whom will be appointed by Sohu, two of whom will be appointed by Tencent, and the seventh of whom will be Sogous then chief executive officer, and (2) after three years following the completion of Sogous IPO, Sohu will be entitled to choose to change the size and composition of Sogous Board of Directors, subject to Tencents right to appoint at least one director. The effect of these provisions is to give Sohu the power to appoint a majority of Sogous Board of Directors, and to give Tencent the power to appoint two directors within three years following the completion of Sogous IPO and at least one director after three years after the completion of Sogous IPO. The Voting Agreement also provides that, subject to certain conditions, for so long as Sohu and Tencent together hold more than 50% of the total voting power of Sogous Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares, Sohu or Tencent may remove and replace any director appointed by it. These provisions of the Voting Agreement are also reflected in Sogous Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association and Amended and Restated Articles of Association. 
 Due to the additional voting power of the Class B Ordinary Shares held by Sohu and Tencent, as of the date of this report Sohu holds approximately 33% of the total of Sogous outstanding Class A and Class B Ordinary Shares and controls approximately 44% of the total voting power of the combined total of Sogous outstanding Class A and Class B Ordinary Shares; Tencent has an indirect shareholding of approximately 39% of the total of Sogous outstanding Class A and Class B Ordinary Shares and controls approximately 52% of the total voting power of the combined total of Sogous outstanding Class A and Class B Ordinary Shares; and Sohu and Tencent together have the power to decide all matters that may be brought to a vote of Sogous shareholders.

The Voting Agreement and Sogous Amended and Restated Articles of Association also specify that for so long as Sohu or Tencent holds not less than 15% of Sogous issued shares (calculated on a fully diluted basis), consent from the holder of 15% or more (either or both of Sohu or Tencent, as the case may be) will be required (1) to amend Sogous Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association or Amended and Restated Articles of Association, (2) to make material changes in Sogous principal lines of business, (3) to issue any additional Class B Ordinary Shares, (4) to create any new class or series of shares that is pari passu with or senior to the Class A Ordinary Shares, (5) for Sogou to approve a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Sogou, or a merger or consolidation resulting in a change in control, or any disposition of all or substantially all of Sogous assets, or (6) for Sogou to enter into any transactions with affiliates of Sohu, other than in the ordinary course of business. Of these corporate actions that are subject to consent of Sohu or Tencent (as applicable), shareholder approval is required under the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands for any amendment of Sogous Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association or Amended and Restated Articles of Association, any winding-up of Sogou Inc., or any merger or consolidation with a third-party entity. The Voting Agreement and Sogous Amended and Restated Articles of Association further provide that if Sogous shareholders have voted in favor of any of these actions requiring the approval of Sogous shareholders but consent from Sohu or Tencent (as applicable) has not been obtained, then the holders of all classes of Sogous shares who have voted against such action will be deemed to have such number of votes as are equal to the aggregate number of votes cast in favor of such actions plus one additional vote. Under these provisions of the Voting Agreement and Sogous Amended and Restated Articles of Association, if an action is proposed for which the consent of either Tencent or Sohu is required, the failure to obtain the consent of Tencent or Sohu will have the effect of the proposed actions not being approved, even if Sogous other shareholders approve it. 
 The Voting Agreement and Sogous Amended and Restated Articles of Association also specify that if at any time Sohu alone holds more than 50% of the total voting power of Sogous Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares, the voting arrangements with respect to the size and composition of Sogous Board of Directors will be automatically suspended until such time within five years after the completion of Sogous IPO as Sohus voting power again drops to 50% or less, in which case the original voting arrangements will be reinstated, provided that Tencent will only be required to vote the lower of 45,578,896 Class B Ordinary Shares held by it or such number as would give Sohu combined voting power of 50%. If such a suspension continues after the fifth anniversary of the completion of Sogous IPO, the voting arrangements with respect to the size and composition of Sogous Board of Directors will terminate. 
 All of the Class B Ordinary Shares held by Sohu will be converted into Class A Ordinary Shares if there is a transaction resulting in change of control of Sohu that was not approved by Sohus board of directors, if specified competitors of Tencent control Sohu, or if a majority of Sohus board of directors consist of nominees of specified competitors of Tencent. The provisions with respect to the size and composition of Sogous Board of Directors set out in the Voting Agreement and Sogous Amended and Restated Articles of Association will terminate upon occurrence of any such event. Such arrangements will also terminate (1) if Dr. Charles Zhang, the chairman of the board of directors of Sohu and the chief executive officer, both ceases being the chairman of the board of directors of Sohu and ceases being the single largest beneficial owner of Sohus outstanding shares; (2) if Sohu transfers 30% or more of the Class B Ordinary Shares that Sohu held upon the completion of Sogous IPO; (3) if Sogou fails to provide irrevocable instructions to the person maintaining Sogous register of members to accept instructions from Tencent, under certain circumstances, with respect to the conversion of Class B Ordinary Shares held by Sohu; (4) or Sogou changes, without Tencents consent, the person that maintains Sogous register of members; (5) or if Tencent ceases to own any Class B Ordinary Shares. 
 Under the Voting Agreement, Sohu and Tencent are subject to certain restrictions on transfer of their Class A and Class B Ordinary Shares. In particular, a transfer of Class B Ordinary Shares by either Sohu or Tencent, respectively, to any person or entity that is not a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Sohu or Tencent, respectively, will cause such Class B Ordinary Shares to be converted into Class A Ordinary Shares. 
 Voting Agreement between Sohu, Photon and Sogou Management 
 Sohu may be deemed to have beneficial ownership attributable to shared voting power of Class A Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by Photon, Sogous chief executive officer Xiaochuan Wang, and four other members of the Sogous management as a result of a voting agreement by and among Sohu, Photon, Mr. Wang, and the other four management members, pursuant to which Photon, Mr. Wang, and the other four management members have agreed to vote their Class A Ordinary Shares (not including shares acquired by Mr. Wang in the public market following Sogous IPO) to elect Sohus designees to the Sogou Board. 
Financial Implications

 Changyous business lines consist of the online game business; the platform channel business, which consists primarily of online advertising and IVAS business; and the cinema advertising business. 
Online Game Business 
 Changyous online game business offers PC games and mobile games to game players. All of Changyous games are operated under the item-based revenue model, meaning that game players can play the games for free, but can choose to pay for virtual items, which are non-physical items that game players can purchase and use within a game, such as gems, pets, fashion items, magic medicine, riding animals, hierograms, skill books and fireworks. Revenues derived from the operation of online games are classified as online game revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Business Model 
 In the brand advertising business, we enjoy a strong competitive position as one of the leading Internet companies in China. Through the platforms described above, we have built a sizeable user base through good user experiences provided by our products and services. This user base is appealing to advertisers. Through PCs and mobile devices, we provide advertisement placements to our advertisers on different Internet platforms and in different formats, which include banners, links, logos, buttons, full screen, pre-roll, mid-roll, post-roll video screens, pause video screens, loading page ads, news feed ads and in-feed video infomercial ads. We rely on both direct sales by our internal sales force and sales by advertising agents for advertising on our Internet platforms. Our advertisers include multinational companies and Chinese domestic medium-sized and small companies. 
 Currently we have four main types of pricing models, consisting of the Fixed Price model, the Cost Per Impression (CPM) model, the Cost Per click (CPC) model, and the E-commerce model. 
 Fixed Price model 
 Under the Fixed Price model, a contract is signed to establish a fixed price for the advertising services to be provided. We recognize revenue based on the contract price and the period of display. 
 CPM model 
 Under the CPM model, the unit price for each qualifying display is fixed, but there is no overall fixed price for the advertising services stated in the contract with the advertiser. A qualifying display is defined as the appearance of an advertisement, where the advertisement meets criteria specified in the contract. We recognize revenue based on the fees we charge the advertisers, which are based on the unit prices and the number of qualifying displays. 
 CPC model 
 Under the CPC model, there is no overall fixed price for advertising services stated in the contract with the advertiser. We charge advertisers on a per-click basis when the users click on the advertisements. The unit price for each click is auction-based. We recognize revenue based on qualifying clicks and the unit price. 
 E-commerce model 
 Under the e-commerce model, revenues are mainly generated from sales of membership cards which allow potential home buyers to purchase specified properties from real estate developers at a discount greater than the price that Focus charges for the card. Membership fees are refundable until the potential home buyers use the discounts to purchase properties. Focus recognizes such revenues upon obtaining confirmation that a membership card has been redeemed to purchase a property.

 Business Model 
 Changyous game players typically access Changyous games through personal computers and mobile devices, such as mobile phones and tablets, connected to the Internet. In order to access Changyous PC games, game access software must be installed in the computer being used. Game players using PCs can typically download Changyous game access software, interim updates and expansion packs directly from its official game Website. Game players access Changyous mobile games by downloading its mobile game applications, primarily from third-party mobile application stores or, to a lesser extent, from Changyous game Website. Prior to the sale of Shenzhen 7Road in August 2015, Changyous online games also included Web games, which became a relatively insignificant part of its online games business following the sale. 
 Changyous online games include a variety of game genres, including massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) and advanced casual games such as CCGs. Changyou is also developing, and plans to expand its game portfolio with, additional types of advanced casual games, such as MOBAs and SLGs. MMORPGs are massive multiplayer online role playing games that allow a large number of players to take on the role of a character and interact with one another within a virtual world. Advanced casual games include CCGs, which are collectible card games in which players collect cards and compete to win by using card sets with different functions; MOBAs, which are multiplayer online battle arena games that allow a player to join a team and work with his or her teammates to compete in a mapped field in order to achieve a common goal; and SLGs, which are simulation games that allow players to control, manage and use game characters and items and to design and implement their own strategies to win the games. 
 Changyous games are operated under the item-based revenue model, meaning game players can play Changyous games for free, but may choose to pay for virtual items, which are non-physical items that game players can purchase and use within a game, such as gems, pets, fashion items, magic medicine, riding animals, hierograms, skill books and fireworks. Through virtual items, players are able to enhance or personalize their game environments or game characters, accelerate their progress in Changyous games and share and trade with friends. 
 For players who choose to purchase virtual goods, Changyou delivers enhanced gameplay experiences and benefits, such as: 
 Accelerated Progress. Many of Changyous games offer players the option to purchase items that can accelerate their progress in the game and increase their capabilities, so that they level up more quickly and compete more effectively against others in the game. While Changyou sells many items that accelerate progress in its games, Changyou monitors and carefully balances the disparity in capabilities between paying and non-paying game players to avoid discouraging non-paying game players and to keep the game challenging and interesting for paying game players. 
 Enhanced Social Interaction. Changyou uses a variety of virtual items to promote interaction and to facilitate relationship-building among game players in its games. 
 Personalized and Customized Appearance. Many of Changyous games offer players the option to purchase decorative and functional items to customize the appearance of their characters, pets, vehicles, houses and other in-game possessions to express their individuality. 
 Gifts. Many of Changyous games offer players the option to purchase gift items to send to their friends. Examples of gift items include decorative items and time-limited items for special holiday events and festivals, such as Valentines Day, Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) and Christmas. 
 Changyous online game business includes games that it self-operates and games that it licenses out to third-party operators. 
 
10 
 
Self-Operated Games 
 For self-operated games, Changyou determines the price of virtual items based on the demand or expected demand for such virtual items. Changyou may change the pricing of certain virtual items based on its consumption patterns. Changyou hosts the games on its own servers and is responsible for sales and marketing of the games as well as customer service. Changyous self-operated games include PC games and mobile games developed in house as well as PC games and mobile games that Changyou licenses from or jointly develops with third party developers. 
 Licensed-Out Games 
 Changyou also authorizes third parties to operate its online games. In 2016, Changyou entered into an agreement with Tencent pursuant to which Changyou granted an exclusive license to Tencent to distribute and operate within China its mobile game Legacy TLBB, which was launched in May 2017. Changyou has also licensed other third-party operators to distribute and operate within China certain of its other mobile games, including Legend of Sword and Fairy 5. In addition, Changyou licenses its PC game TLBB and mobile games Legacy TLBB, TLBB 3D and Fengyun to third-party operators in selected overseas markets outside of China, including Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and South Korea. 
 The licensed-out games include PC games and mobile games developed in house as well as mobile games licensed from and jointly developed with third-party developers. Under Changyous licensing arrangements with third-party operators, the operators pay Changyou upfront license fees and Changyou has revenue sharing rights over the terms of the licenses. The licenses are typically for a term of one to three years. Changyou provide updates and expansion packs for the licensed games, typically after it launches the updates and expansion packs in China. 
 For licensed-out games, the third-party operators are responsible for all operations and costs, including marketing and customer service, as well as the leasing and maintenance of servers. 
 Platform Channel Business 
 Changyous platform channel business consists primarily of the operation of the 17173.com Website, RaidCall, and MoboTap. 
 17173.com Website 
 The 17173.com Website is one of the leading information portals in China, and provides news, electronic forums, online videos and other information services regarding online games to game players. All revenues generated by the 17173.com Website are classified as brand advertising revenues. 
 RaidCall 
 RaidCall provides online music and entertainment services, primarily in Taiwan. All revenues generated by RaidCall from IVAS are classified as other revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
 MoboTap 
 MoboTap provides (a) software applications for PCs and mobile devices through the Dolphin Browser, which is a gateway to a host of user activities on mobile devices with the majority of its users based in overseas markets, and (b) domestic online card and board games. IVAS revenues generated by the Dolphin Browser are classified as other revenues and online card and board games revenues generated by MoboTap are classified as online game revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
 Cinema Advertising Business 
 Changyou also operates a cinema advertising business, which consists primarily of the acquisition, from operators of movie theaters, and the sale, to advertisers, of pre-film advertising slots, which are advertisements shown before the screening of a movie in a cinema theatre. Revenues generated by Changyous cinema advertising business are classified as other revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

COMPETITION 
 The Internet and Internet-related markets in China are rapidly evolving. We believe the rapid increase in Chinas online population will draw more attention to the PRC Internet market from both domestic and multinational competitors. Our existing competitors may in the future achieve greater market acceptance and gain additional market share. It is also possible that new competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share. In addition, our competitors may leverage their existing Internet platforms to cross-sell newly launched products and services. It is also possible that, as a result of deficiencies in legal protections afforded intellectual property in the Internet industry in China, or inadequate enforcement of existing PRC laws protecting such intellectual property, we may not be able to prevent existing or new competitors from accessing and using our in-house developed Web content or technologies. 
 In recent years there have emerged three large conglomerates, Tencent, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (Alibaba) and Baidu, Inc. (Baidu), that have a wide reach in the Internet industry in China, and between them tend to dominate key aspects of the industry through their own operations or through strategic investments in other companies. Each of these companies is in a position to compete very effectively against us. For example, Alibaba alone competes with us in almost every key aspect of our business, competing with us in media through its investment in Sina Corporation (Sina); in online video through its subsidiary Youku Tudou Inc. (Youku Tudou); and in online search through its subsidiary UCWeb Inc. (UCWeb). 
 Competition for Sohus Business 
 In the PRC Internet space, competition for brand advertising business is intense and is expected to increase significantly in the future. We compete with our peers and competitors in China primarily on the following basis: 

 | access to financial resources;
--+-------------------------------


 | gateway to host of Internet users activities;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | technological advancements;
--+----------------------------


 | attractiveness of products;
--+----------------------------


 | brand recognition;
--+-------------------


 | volume of traffic and users;
--+-----------------------------


 | quality of Internet platforms and content;
--+-------------------------------------------


 | quality and quantity of purchased video content, self-developed video content, and user-generated content;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | strategic relationships;
--+-------------------------


 | quality of services;
--+---------------------


 | effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | talent of staff; and
--+---------------------


 | pricing.
--+---------

 Over time, our competitors may gradually build certain competitive advantages over us in terms of: 
 

 | greater brand recognition among Internet users and clients;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 | better products and services;
--+------------------------------


 | larger user and advertiser bases;
--+----------------------------------


 | more extensive and well developed marketing and sales networks; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | substantially greater financial and technical resources.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 There are a number of existing or new PRC Internet companies, including those controlled or sponsored by private entities and by PRC government entities. As an Internet portal, we compete with various portals, including Tencent, Sina, NetEase.com, Inc. (NetEase), TouTiao.com and Phoenix New Media Limited (Phoenix), and vertical sites, such as Autohome Inc.(Autohome), Bitauto Holdings Limited (BitAuto), Youku Tudou, Beijing Xin Lian Xin De Advertising Media Co., Ltd. (iQIYI), SouFun Holdings Limited (SouFun), Leju Holdings Limited (Leju), and 58.com Inc. (58.com). 
 
12 
 
We also compete with traditional forms of media, such as newspapers, magazines, radio and television, for advertisers, advertising revenues and content. Some of these traditional media, such as CCTV, Xinhua News Agency and Peoples Daily, have extended their businesses into the Internet market. As a result, we expect to face more intense competition with traditional media companies in both their traditional media and in the Internet-related markets. 
 Competition for Sogous Business 
 Sogous business consists primarily of search and search-related services. Sogou faces intense competition in these areas primarily from Baidu and ShenMa. Sogou also faces competition for both users and advertisers from websites that provide specialized search services in China, including travel services and information platforms such as Ctrip and Qunar; group-buy platforms such as Meituan Dianping; online classified advertisement platforms such as 58.com; and newsfeeds such as Toutiao. Sogou competes for advertisers not only with Internet companies, but also with other types of advertising media such as newspapers and magazines, billboards and bus advertisements, television, and radio. 
 Sogous existing and potential competitors compete with Sogou for users and advertisers on the basis of the quality and quantity of search results; the features, availability, and ease of use of products and services; and the number and quality of advertising distribution channels. They also compete with Sogou for talent with technological expertise, which is critical to the sustained development of Sogous products and services. 
 Competition for Changyous Business

 GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES 
 The following description of PRC laws and regulations is based upon the opinion of Haiwen & Partners, or Haiwen, our PRC legal counsel. The laws and regulations affecting Chinas Internet industry and other aspects of our business are at an early stage of development and are evolving. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that the PRC regulatory authorities would find that our corporate structure and business operations strictly comply with PRC laws and regulations. If we are found to be in violation of PRC laws and regulations by the PRC government, we may be required to pay fines, obtain additional or different licenses or permits, and/or change, suspend or discontinue our business operations until we are found to comply with applicable laws. For a description of legal risks relating to our ownership structure and business, see Risk Factors. 
Overview 
 The Chinese government has enacted an extensive regulatory scheme governing Internet-related areas, such as telecommunications, Internet information services, international connections to computer information networks, online game services, information security and censorship.

Specific Statutes and Regulations 
 Requirements for Establishment of WFOEs 
 Under the Law of the Peoples Republic of China on Foreign Investment Enterprises (the Foreign Investment Enterprises Law), promulgated on April 12, 1986 and amended on October 31, 2000, the establishment of a WFOE was required to be approved by MOFCOM or one of its local branches. On September 3, 2016, the Foreign Investment Enterprises Law was further amended by the Decision of the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress on Amending Four Laws including the Law of the Peoples Republic of China on Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises, issued by the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress, and on October 8, 2016 MOFCOM issued the Interim Measures for the Administration of Filing for Establishment and Change of the Foreign Investment Enterprises (the Interim Filing Measures), which were further amended on July 30, 2017. The Foreign Investment Enterprises Law and the Interim Filing Measures provide that, with certain exceptions, the establishment of foreign-invested enterprises is only subject to certain filing requirements with, and no longer requires prior approval by, MOFCOM or its local branches. 
 Each of our WFOEs established before September 3, 2016 was established with proper approval, and we have not established any WFOEs since September 3, 2016. 
 Requirements for Obtaining Business Licenses 
 All China-based companies may commence operations only upon the issuance of a business license by the relevant local branch of the SAIC. All of our China-Based Subsidiaries and VIEs have been issued business licenses by the relevant local branches of the SAIC. 
 In the opinion of Haiwen, our principal China-Based Subsidiaries and principal VIEs have satisfied the requirements for business licenses. 
 Regulation of Value-added Telecommunications Services 
 The Telecommunications Regulations of the Peoples Republic of China (Telecom Regulations), implemented on September 25, 2000 and amended on July 29, 2014, are the primary PRC law governing telecommunication services, and set out the general framework for the provision of telecommunication services by domestic PRC companies. The Telecom Regulations require that telecommunications service providers procure operating licenses prior to commencing operations. The Telecom Regulations draw a distinction between basic telecommunications services, which we generally do not provide, and value-added telecommunications services. The Telecom Regulations define value-added telecommunications services as telecommunications and information services provided through public networks. The Catalogue of Telecommunications Business (Catalogue), which was issued as an attachment to the Telecom Regulations and updated in February 2003 and December 2015, identifies Internet data centers, content delivery networks, domestic Internet virtual private networks, Internet access, online data and transaction processing, on-demand voice and image communications, message storage and forwarding (including voice mailbox, e-mail and online fax services), call centers, and online information and data search as value-added telecommunications services. We engage in various types of business activities that are value-added telecommunications services as defined and described by the Telecom Regulations and the Catalogue. 
 On July 3, 2017, the MIIT issued the Administration Measures for Telecommunications Business Operating Permits (the Telecom License Measures), which became effective on September 1, 2017, to supplement the Telecom Regulations and replace the previous Measures on the Administration of Telecommunications Business Operating Permits promulgated in 2009. The Telecom License Measures provide requirements and procedures for obtaining licenses for value-added telecommunications services, and stipulate that the competent governmental authorities will mandate improved credit management mechanisms for telecommunication business operators, and will establish an online platform in connection with telecommunication business operating permits. The Telecom License Measures also confirm that there are two types of telecom operating licenses for operators in China, one for basic telecommunications services and one for value-added telecommunications services. A distinction is also made as to whether a license is granted for intra-provincial or trans-regional (inter-provincial) activities. An appendix to each license granted will detail the permitted activities of the enterprise to which it was granted. An approved telecommunication services operator must conduct its business (whether basic or value-added) in accordance with the specifications recorded in its Telecommunications Services Operating License. 
 
18 
 
The business activities of Sohu Internet and Sogou Information include providing content to mobile phone users through the platforms of Chinas main three telecommunications operators. The business activities of Sogou Information also include providing search services to mobile phone users through the platforms of Chinas main three telecommunications operators. On April 25, 2004, the MIIT issued a notice stating that China mobile network operators may only provide mobile network access to those mobile Internet service providers which have obtained licenses from the relevant local arm of the MIIT before conducting operations. On the basis of the notice, China Mobile Communication Corporation (China Mobile) has required each of its mobile Internet service providers to first obtain a license for trans-regional value-added telecommunications services in order to gain full access to its mobile network, which is a nationwide policy in line with a similar notice issued by the Beijing branch of China Mobile on April 12, 2004. On August 8, 2014 and January 30, 2015, respectively, the MIIT issued to Sohu Internet and Guangzhou Qianjun Value-Added Telecommunications Services Operating Licenses that authorize the provision of trans-regional mobile services classified as value-added telecommunication services. Sohu Internets license was renewed on November 3, 2017, and Guangzhou Qianjuns license was renewed on January 23, 2017. On June 2, 2016, the MIIT issued to Sogou Information Value-Added Telecommunications Services Operating Licenses that authorize the provision of information services, Internet data centers and Internet access classified as value-added telecommunication services. The licenses are subject to annual inspection. 
 Regulation of Foreign Direct Investment in Value-Added Telecommunications Companies 
 Various PRC regulations currently restrict foreign-invested entities from engaging in value-added telecommunication services, including providing Internet information services and operating online games. Foreign direct investment in telecommunications companies in China is regulated by the Regulations for the Administration of Foreign-Invested Telecommunications Enterprises (FITE Regulations), which were issued by the PRC State Council, or State Council, on December 11, 2001, became effective on January 1, 2002 and were amended on September 10, 2008 and February 6, 2016. The FITE Regulations stipulate that foreign invested telecommunications enterprises in the PRC (FITEs) must be established as Sino-foreign equity joint ventures. Under the FITE Regulations and in accordance with WTO-related agreements, the foreign party to a FITE engaging in value-added telecommunications services may hold up to 50% of the equity of the FITE, with no geographic restrictions on the FITEs operations. On June 30, 2016, the MIIT issued an Announcement of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Issues concerning the Provision of Telecommunication Services in the Mainland by Service Providers from Hong Kong and Macao (the MIIT Announcement), which provides that investors from Hong Kong and Macau may hold more than 50% of the equity in FITEs engaging in certain specified categories of value-added telecommunications services. 
 For a FITE to acquire any equity interest in a value-added telecommunications business in China, it must satisfy a number of stringent performance and operational experience requirements, including demonstrating a track record and experience in operating a value-added telecommunications business overseas. FITEs that meet these requirements must obtain approvals from the MIIT and the MOFCOM or their authorized local counterparts, which retain considerable discretion in granting approvals. 
 On July 13, 2006, the Notice of the Ministry of Information Industry on Intensifying the Administration of Foreign Investment in Value-added Telecommunications Services (the MIIT Notice), which reiterates certain provisions of the FITE Regulations, was issued. Under the MIIT Notice, if a FITE intends to invest in a PRC value-added telecommunications business, the FITE must be established and must apply for a telecommunications business license applicable to the business. Under the MIIT Notice, a domestic company that holds a license for the provision of Internet content services, or an ICP license, is considered to be a type of value-added telecommunications business in China, and is prohibited from leasing, transferring or selling the license to foreign investors in any form, and from providing any assistance, including providing resources, sites or facilities, to foreign investors to conduct value-added telecommunications businesses illegally in China. Trademarks and domain names that are used in the provision of Internet content services must be owned by the ICP license holder or its shareholders. The MIIT Notice requires each ICP license holder to have appropriate facilities for its approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license. In addition, all value-added telecommunications service providers are required to maintain network and information security in accordance with standards set forth in relevant PRC regulations. Our VIEs, rather than our subsidiaries, hold ICP licenses, own our domain names, and hold or have applied for registration in the PRC of trademarks related to our business and own and maintain facilities that we believe are appropriate for our business operations. 
 On November 27, 2017, the MIIT promulgated the Notice Regulating the Use of Domain Names in the Provision of Internet-based Information Services, or the Domain Names Notice, which became effective on January 1, 2018. Under the Domain Names Notice, a domain name used by a provider of Internet-based information services must be registered and owned by the provider or, if the provider is an entity, by a shareholder or senior management of the provider. 
 
19 
 
In view of these restrictions on foreign direct investment in the value-added telecommunications sector, we established or acquired several domestic VIEs to engage in value-added telecommunications services. For a detailed discussion of our VIEs, please refer to Our Corporate Structure above. Due to a lack of interpretative materials from the relevant PRC authorities, there are uncertainties regarding whether PRC authorities would consider our corporate structure and contractual arrangements to constitute foreign ownership of a value-added telecommunications business. See Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure. In order to comply with PRC regulatory requirements, we operate our main business through companies with which we have contractual relationships but in which we do not have an actual ownership interest. If our current ownership structure is found to be in violation of current or future PRC laws, rules or regulations regarding the legality of foreign investment in the PRC Internet sector, we could be subject to severe penalties. 
 In the opinion of Haiwen, subject to the uncertainties and risks disclosed elsewhere in this report under the heading Risk Factors and Government Regulation and Legal Uncertainties, the ownership structures of our principal PRC Subsidiaries and our principal VIEs comply with all existing laws, rules and regulations of the PRC and each of such companies has the full legal right, power and authority, and has been duly approved, to carry on and engage in the business described in its business license. 
 Regulation of the Provision of Internet Content 
 Internet Information Services 
 On September 25, 2000, the State Council issued the Measures for the Administration of Internet Information Services (ICP Measures). Under the ICP Measures, entities that provide information to online users on the Internet, or ICPs, are obliged to obtain an operating license from the MIIT or its local branch at the provincial or municipal level in accordance with the Telecom Regulations described above. 
 The ICP Measures further stipulate that entities providing online information services regarding news, publishing, education, medicine, health, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment must procure the consent of the national authorities responsible for such areas prior to applying for an operating license from the MIIT or its local branch at the provincial or municipal level. Moreover, ICPs must display their operating license numbers in conspicuous locations on their home pages. ICPs are required to police their Internet platforms and remove certain prohibited content. Many of these requirements mirror Internet content restrictions that have been announced previously by PRC ministries, such as the MIIT, the MOC, and the SAPPRFT, that derive their authority from the State Council. 
 Sogou Information, Sohu Internet, Focus Interactive, Guangzhou Qianjun, Shanghai ICE, Guanyou Gamespace, and Gamease hold Telecommunications and Information Services Operating Licenses (each an ICP license), each of which is subject to annual inspection. 
 In 2000, the MIIT promulgated the Internet Electronic Bulletin Service Administrative Measures (BBS Measures). The BBS Measures required ICPs to obtain specific approvals before they provided BBS services, which included electronic bulletin boards, electronic forums, message boards and chat rooms. On September 23, 2014, the MIIT abolished the BBS Measures in a Decision on Abolishment and Amendment Certain Regulations and Rules. However, in practice certain local authorities still require operating companies to obtain approvals or make filings for the operation of BBS services. The ICP licenses held by Sohu Internet, Sogou Information, Focus Interactive, Gamease and Guanyou Gamespace include such specific approval of the BBS services that they provide. 
 On December 29, 2011, the MIIT issued Several Provisions for Standardizing the Market Order of Internet Information Services (the Several Provisions) which took effect on March 15, 2012. With the aim of promoting the healthy development of the Internet information services market in China, the Several Provisions strengthen the regulation of the operations of Internet information service providers, including prohibiting Internet information service providers from infringing the rights and interests of other Internet information service providers, regulating evaluations provided by Internet information service providers regarding the services and products of other Internet information service providers, and regulating the installation and running of software by Internet information service providers. The Several Provisions also provide various rules to protect the interests of Internet information users, such as requesting Internet information service providers to take measures to protect the privacy information of their users and prohibiting Internet information service providers from cheating and misleading their users.

On August 25, 2017, the CAOC issued the Administration Measures for Internet Forum Community Service, effective on October 1, 2017, to regulate the provision of online interactive social network services for information dissemination. On August 25, 2017, the CAOC issued the Administration Measures for Internet Comment Thread Services, effective on October 1, 2017, for regulating the provision of services by websites, applications, interactive broadcasting platforms, and other communication platforms with news and media characteristics that allow users to release text, photos, audio, and video. On September 7, 2017, the CAOC issued the Administration Measures for Internet Chat Group Services, effective on October 8, 2017, to regulate the provision of platform services for that allow Internet user groups to exchange information online. On September 7, the CAOC issued the Administration Measures for Internet Users Social Account Information Services, effective on October 8, 2017. These measures provide, among other things, that Internet platform operators providing the covered services will be responsible for the security of information and content published over their platforms, and provide enhanced requirements for user registration, information review, emergency response, and security. 
 Online News Dissemination and Online News Search Services 
 In May 2017, the Administrative Regulations for Internet News Information Services and Implementation Rules on the Administration of Internet News Information Services Permits (collectively the News Regulations) were promulgated by the CAOC to replace the Administrative Rules for Internet News Information Services promulgated by the SCIO in 2005 (the Old News Rules). The News Regulations stipulate that Internet news information services include production, publishing, and republishing services and platforms providing for the dissemination of news over the Internet, and specify that platforms providing for the dissemination of news over the Internet will be required to obtain an Internet news information services permit. 
 Requirements of News Regulations include, among other things, the following: 
 

 | Internet news information service providers must be entities duly incorporated within the territory of the PRC;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Managers and chief editors of Internet news information service providers must be Chinese citizens;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Internet news information service providers must have personnel who have appropriate qualification and professional training;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Internet news information service providers must have sound Internet news information service management systems;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Internet news information service providers must have rigorous information security management systems;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Internet news information service providers must have facilities that are suitable for their proposed services, and must be adequately funded; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Internet news information service providers may only republish news published by governmental news agencies and must ensure the original sources are traceable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On July 3, 2016, the CAOC issued a Notice on Further Strengthening the Management and Prevention of Fake News (the Fake News Notice). The Fake News Notice requires all providers of online news services, including news applications, Weibo, and WeChat, to establish and maintain rigorous internal supervision and management systems and to not provide any news without identifying the sources of the news, invent news, report news based on hearsay, or distort facts. 
 On May 11, 2004, Sohu Internet obtained from the Information Office of the Beijing Municipal Government (the local arm of the SCIO) an Internet news information services permit, which was updated by the SCIO on June 6, 2006. There is uncertainty as to whether the provision of news search services and aggregation of news links fit within the definition of news dissemination services. Sogou Information is currently in the process of applying for an online news services license. 
 Internet Publishing 
 On February 4, 2016, the SAPPRFT and MIIT jointly issued the Rules for the Administration for Internet Publishing Services (the Internet Publishing Rules), which took effect on March 10, 2016, to replace the Provisional Rules for the Administration for Internet Publishing that had been jointly issued by the SAPPRFT and the MIIT on June 27, 2002. The Internet Publishing Rules define Internet publications as digital works that are edited, produced or processed to be published and provided to the public through the Internet, including (a) original digital works, such as pictures, maps, games, and comics; (b) digital works with content that is consistent with the type of content that, prior to the Internet age, typically was published in media such as books, newspapers, periodicals, audio-visual products, and electronic publications; (c) digital works in the form of online databases compiled by selecting, arranging and compiling other types of digital works; and (d) other types of digital works identified by the SAPPRFT. Under the Internet Publishing Rules, Internet operators distributing such Internet publications via information networks, including Web portals such as ours, are required to apply to and register with the SAPPRFT before distributing Internet publications. 
 
21 
 
On December 22, 2010, Sohu Internet obtained an Internet publishing license issued by the SAPPRFT, which was renewed on January 1, 2017. Sogou Information plans to apply for an Internet publishing license. For the details of the Internet publishing licenses held by Changyous VIEs, see Specific Statutes and RegulationsRegulation of Online Game Services Online Games and Cultural Products. 
 Online Audiovisual Transmission Through the Public Internet 
 On December 20, 2007, the SAPPRFT and the MIIT jointly issued Rules for the Administration of Internet Audiovisual Program Services (Document 56), which came into effect as of January 31, 2008 and was amended on August 28, 2015. Document 56 requires all online audio and video service providers to be either state-owned or state-controlled and to obtain a permit for the Network Transmission of Audiovisual Programs. However, at a press conference held on February 3, 2008 the SAPPRFT and the MIIT clarified that online audio-visual service providers that were already lawfully operating prior to the issuance of Document 56 may re-register and continue to operate without becoming state-owned or controlled, provided that such providers do not engage in any unlawful activities. This exemption will not be granted to service providers set up after Document 56 was issued. As we were already engaged in online audiovisual transmission prior to the issuance of Document 56, we are presumably exempted from the requirement of being state-owned or state-controlled. Sohu Internet and Guangzhou Qianju currently hold permits, both for PC and for Mobile Apps, for the Network Transmission of Audiovisual Programs. 
 On March 30, 2009, the SAPPRFT released a Notice on Strengthening the Administration of Online Audiovisual Content (the March 2009 SAPPRFT notice). March 2009 SAPPRFT notice requires the operators of audiovisual Websites to enhance their processes for protecting copyrights, and to take appropriate measures to protect the rights and interests of copyright holders. Operators of such sites must hold, or have a license to, the copyright to all content that they transmit. In addition, the March 2009 SAPPRFT notice stipulates that only those films or TV programs that have already obtained from the SAPPRFT a Film Public Screening Permit, TV Drama Distribution Permit, TV Animation Distribution Permit, or TV Documentary Film Screening Permit are allowed to be transmitted via audiovisual Websites. These permits are mandatory for all films and programs shown on TV and in cinemas in China and must be obtained before such film or TV or program is allowed to be released. The approval applications for the Film Public Screening Permit, Television Drama Distribution Permit, Television Animation Distribution Permit or Television Documentary Film Screening Permit are extremely difficult and time-consuming, and the SAPPRFT previously did not enforce very strictly the requirements regarding these permits. However, on September 2, 2014, the SAPPRFT issued a Notice on Further Strengthening the Administration of Online Foreign Audiovisual Content (September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice), which requires that operators of audiovisual Websites to obtain from the SAPPRFT a Film Public Screening Permit, TV Drama Distribution Permit, or TV Animation Distribution Permit for all foreign films and TV dramas before they are transmitted via the Internet in China. The September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice further stipulates that before any foreign films or TV dramas for transmission exclusively via the Internet are purchased after the promulgation of the September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice, operators of audiovisual Websites must declare their annual purchasing plans with the SAPPRFT before the end of the year preceding the year of the intended broadcast and obtain the SAPPRFTs approval. The September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice also states that the number of foreign films and TV dramas to be purchased by an operator and transmitted via its Website in a single year may not exceed 30% of the total amount of the Chinese films and TV dramas purchased and transmitted by the same Website in the previous year. 
 On April 1, 2010, SAPPRFT issued a Catalogue of Classification of Internet Audio-Video Program Services (Trial) (the Internet Audio-Video Program Catalogue), which was amended on March 10, 2017. The Internet Audio-Video Program Catalogue classifies Internet audio-video program services (excluding IPTV, Internet TV and mobile TV services) provided to computer and mobile phone users the Internet into four categories, consisting of (i) Internet audio-video programs sponsored and broadcast through Internet radio and television stations, including political news, political talk shows, self-produced news programs and live programs of vital political, military, economic, social and sports activities; (ii) reprints of political news, Internet hosting, interviews, report and commentary services in entertainment, technology, financial, sports and educational audio-video programs, production and broadcasting of Internet dramas, compilation and broadcasting of entertainment, technology, financial, sports and education audio-video programs, and live broadcasting of cultural and sports activities; (iii) the aggregation of Internet audio-video programs, which means editing and arranging Internet audio-visual programs on the same website, providing search and viewing services to public users, and broadcasting user-uploaded audio-video programs; and (iv) retransmission of Internet audio-video programs. A permit for the Network Transmission of Audiovisual Programs specifies the scope of the services under one or more of these categories that the holder of the permit is allowed to provide. Our permit for the Network Transmission of Audiovisual Programs allows us to provide services mostly under the categories described in clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) above. Sogou information is currently in the process of negotiating with an entity that holds a permit for the Network Transmission of Audiovisual Programs in order to acquire all of the equity interests in such entity. 
 On July 6, 2012, the SAPPRFT issued a Notice on Further Strengthening the Administration of Internet Dramas, Micro Movies and Other Internet Audiovisual programs (the 2012 SAPPRFT Notice 53), which reiterates that online audio-visual service providers must obtain a Permit for the Network Transmission of Audiovisual Programs from the SAPPRFT. The 2012 SAPPRFT Notice 53 further stipulates that online audio-visual service providers must review the content of Internet audiovisual programs prior to their transmission and must file certain information, such as the names of the Internet audiovisual programs, summaries of their content and names of the persons conducting the reviews, with the appropriate provincial office of the SAPPRFT. 
 
22 
 
On January 2, 2014, the SAPPRFT issued a Supplemental Notice on 2012 SAPPRFT Notice 53, which stipulates that producers of Internet dramas, micro movies and other Internet audiovisual programs must obtain a Permit for Radio and Television Program Production and Operation. Online audio-visual service providers may only retransmit dramas and micro movies produced and uploaded by individuals whose identities have been verified and the content of which complies with relevant regulations. Online audio-visual service providers must file with the provincial SAPPRFT the content of Internet audiovisual programs proposed for transmission prior to transmitting the programs. 
 On November 4, 2016, the SAPPRFT issued a Notice on Further Strengthening the Planning, Development and Administration of Original Internet Audiovisual Programs (Document 198). Document 198 stipulates that if online service providers plan to produce and disseminate audiovisual programs that are considered to be key audiovisual programs under Document 198, the service providers must, during the early planning and development stage, file a summary of the programs and their titles, producer names, themes, and duration with the SAPPRFT and, for audiovisual programs with sensitive themes such as politics, military, diplomacy, national security, national sovereignty, religion, the PRC justice system and public security, consult with designated PRC governmental authorities before production of the programs. On June 26, 2017, SAPPRFT and other several governmental authorities issued a Notice on Several Policies Concerning the Prosperity and Development of Television Dramas that confirms filing procedures with respect to key Internet dramas. 
 Private Network and Targeted Communication Audiovisual Program Services 
 On April 25, 2016, the SAPPRFT issued the Provisions on the Administration of Private Network and Targeted Communication Audiovisual Program Services (the Private Network Audiovisual Programs Administration Provisions), effective on June 1, 2016, to replace the Measures for the Administration of the Transmission of Audiovisual Programs over Internet and other Information Networks that had been issued by the SAPPRFT on July 6, 2004. The Private Network Audiovisual Programs Administration Provisions stipulate that private network and targeted communication audiovisual program services include the provision, integrated control, transmission and distribution of audiovisual content through IPTV, targeted mobile television, television network and other targeted channels. The Private Network Audiovisual Programs Administration Provisions provide that operators engaging in private network and targeted communication audiovisual program services must obtain a permit for the Network Transmission of Audiovisual Programs from the SAPPRFT. The Private Network Audiovisual Programs Administration Provisions provide that only PRC state-owned or state-controlled entities may engage in private network and targeted communication audiovisual program services. We provide a small amount of audiovisual program services through private network and/or targeted communication channels, such as IPTVs and television networks. In order to comply with the Private Network Audiovisual Programs Administration Provisions, we partner with PRC state-owned entities for the provision of such services through private network and targeted communication channels. According to a press conference of SAPPRFT regarding the Private Network Audiovisual Programs Administration Provisions, Internet audiovisual program services provided through the public Internet, which include our main online video services, other than private network and targeted communication channels should comply with Document 56. See Government Regulation and Legal UncertaintiesSpecific Statutes and RegulationsRegulation of the Provision of Internet Content Online Audiovisual Transmission through the Public Internet for a description of regulations affecting Internet Audio-video program services provided through the public Internet; 
Online Cultural Products 
 On May 10, 2003, the MOC issued the Provisional Regulations for the Administration of Online Culture (Online Culture Regulations), which took effect on July 1, 2003 and were amended on July 1, 2004. On February 17, 2011, the MOC issued the new Provisional Regulations for the Administration of Online Culture (New Online Culture Regulations), which took effect on April 1, 2011, to replace the previous regulations. The New Online Culture Regulations apply to entities engaging in activities related to Internet cultural products, which include those cultural products that are produced specially for Internet use, such as online music and entertainment, online games, online plays, online performances, online works of art and Web animations, and those cultural products that, through technical means, produce or reproduce music, entertainment, games, plays and other art works for Internet dissemination. Pursuant to the New Online Culture Regulations, commercial entities are required to apply to the relevant local branch of the MOC for an Online Culture Operating Permit if they engage in any of the following types of activities: 

 | the production, duplication, importation, release or broadcasting of Internet cultural products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the dissemination of online cultural products on the Internet or transmission thereof via Internet or mobile phone networks to users terminals such as computers, fixed-line or mobile phones, television sets, gaming consoles and Internet surfing service sites such as Internet cafés for the purpose of browsing, using or downloading such products; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the exhibition or holding of contests related to Internet cultural products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
23 
 
On January 6, 2016, the MOC issued Trial Measures of Administration of Cultural Market Blacklist (the Blacklist Measures), which stipulate that cultural products containing prohibited content, including content so specified by the New Online Culture Regulations, that has a material adverse effect on society will be listed in a cultural product blacklist published by the MOC or its local branches. Any future application made to the MOC or its local branches by an online cultural operator that has engaged in the distribution of cultural products included in the blacklist will be subject to heightened scrutiny. 
 On July 1, 2016, the MOC issued a Notice on Strengthening the Administration of Online Performance (the Online Performance Notice) and on December 2, 2016, issued the Measures of Administration of Online Performance Operating Activities (the Online Performance Measures), which became effective on January 1, 2017. The Online Performance Notice and the Online Performance Measures both stipulate that online performance service providers must obtain an Online Culture Operating Permit and that online performances must not contain any content that is horrific, cruel, violent, vulgar or humiliating in nature, mocks persons with disabilities, includes photographs or video clips that infringe third parties privacy or other rights, features animal abuse, or presents characters and other features of online games that have not been registered and approved for publication by applicable PRC governmental authorities. 
 On September 2, 2016, the SAPPRFT issued the Notice on Strengthening the Management of Live Online Social Video Services (the Live Online Notice), which requires interactive broadcasting service providers to procure a permit for the Network Transmission of Audiovisual Programs. Sohu Internet and Guangzhou Qianju currently hold permits for the Network Transmission of Audiovisual Programs. The Live Online Notice also stipulates that a service provider must make a filing with the local SAPPRFT branch at least five days before making any live broadcast of any significant political, military, economic, social, cultural or sports activities and at least 48 hours before making any live broadcast of other cultural or sports activities. On November 4, 2016, the CAOC issued the Provisions on the Administration of Online Live Social Video Services (the Live Social Video Provisions) effective December 1, 2016. The Live Social Video Provisions provide that business entities such as us that offer interactive broadcasting services on their Internet platforms have the primary responsibility for monitoring content disseminated by interactive broadcasting hosts and viewers through such services, and must allocate sufficient staff in line with the scale of such services and establish and maintain adequate internal policies and procedures for, among other things, content review, information security management, emergency management and technical support. The Live Social Video Provisions also require that Internet providers verify the real-name identity of interactive broadcasting hosts and viewers before allowing them to establish user accounts with the Internet providers and take appropriate remedial actions, such as issuing warnings, removing posted content, or terminating the users account, with respect to interactive broadcasting content or activity that is prohibited by the Live Social Video Provisions. Internet providers are subject to administrative penalties and other sanctions for noncompliance with the Live Social Video Provisions. 
 Sohu Internet, Guangzhou Qianjun, Focus Interactive, Sogou Information, Gamease, Guanyou Gamespace, and Shanghai ICE currently hold Online Culture Operating Permits, each of which is subject to annual inspection. Focus Interactive has recently applied to have the license renewed. 
 Mobile Internet Applications Information Services 
 On June 28, 2016, the CAOC issued the Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Applications Information Services (the APP Provisions), which became effective on August 1, 2016. Under the APP Provisions, mobile application providers and application store service providers are prohibited from engaging in any activity that may endanger national security, disturb the social order, or infringe the legal rights of third parties, and may not produce, copy, issue or disseminate through mobile applications any content prohibited by laws and regulations. The APP Provisions also require application providers to procure relevant approval to provide services through such applications and require application store service providers to register with local branch offices of the CAOC within 30 days after they start providing application store services. We have procured the required approvals for services that we provide through our mobile applications. Sogou Information has filed an application for registration with the applicable local branch of the CAOC with respect to its provision of application store services. 
Internet Map Services 
 Under the Opinions on Strengthening the Supervision of Internet Map and Geographic Information Services and the Notices on Further Strengthening the Management of Internet Map Services Permit issued on February 25, 2008 and December 23, 2011, respectively, by the State Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geo-information (the SASMG, formerly known as the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping), and six other governmental authorities and the Administrative Regulations on Maps issued by the State Council on November 26, 2015, effective on January 1, 2016, any provider of Internet map services that is not a professional surveying and mapping enterprise must obtain the approval of the SASMG or its local branches and a Surveying and Mapping Qualification Certificate in order to provide such services. In addition, providers of Internet map services must use maps obtained through government-approved channels and display the SASMG approval number, the Surveying and Mapping Qualification Certificate number and the Telecommunications Services Operating License number in conspicuous locations on their Websites. 
 
24 
 
On July 1, 2014, the SASMG issued new Administrative Regulations on Surveying and Mapping Qualification Certificate and Classification Standard on Surveying and Mapping Qualification Certificate (the SASMG Regulations and Standards) to replace previous regulations and standards issued on April 16, 2004 and March 12, 2009. Under the SASMG Regulations and Standards, there are two types of Surveying and Mapping Qualification certificates that may be issued to providers of Internet map services. A Class A certificate allows a holder to provide (i) map-location services, (ii) geo-information uploading and dimension services, and (iii) geo-information database development services, while a holder of a Class B certificate may only provide the first two types of services. 
 On July 26, 2016, the SASMG and the Office of the Central Leading Group for Cyberspace Affairs (the OCLGCA) jointly issued a Notice on Standardizing the Usage of Maps by Internet Services Providers (the Maps Usage Notice), which stipulates that all the Internet service providers must review and use maps in accordance with the PRC Surveying and Mapping Law and Administrative Regulations on Maps. The Maps Usage Notice requires that maps displayed by Internet service providers be obtained through government-approved channels and identify their sources and censor numbers. Internet service providers are prohibited from using maps obtained from unaccredited sources, including foreign Websites. All maps, other than scenic maps, block maps, subway maps and other specified maps, must be reviewed by PRC governmental authorities before they are published, and must not contain any information or content specified as prohibited in the Maps Usage Notice. The PRC Surveying and Mapping Law, as amended effective July 1, 2017, requires, among other things, that Internet map service providers use maps that have been reviewed and approved by relevant authorities and establish data security systems for Internet maps. On January 1, 2015, Sogou Information obtained Class A Certificate of Surveying and Mapping Qualification from the SASMG. 
 Internet Medical, Health and Pharmaceuticals Information Dissemination 
 Under the Measures for the Administration of Internet Pharmaceuticals Information Services (the Pharmaceuticals Information Services Measures) issued by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) on July 8, 2004, which were amended on November 17, 2017, the formal approval of the SFDA or one of its local branches is required before a Website may disseminate information concerning pharmaceuticals. 
 Under the Pharmaceuticals Information Services Measures, medical, health and pharmaceutical information (including information with respect to medical equipment) provided by Websites must be scientific and accurate and must indicate the sources of such information. Websites that have received approval to disseminate such information must also publish or reprint health policies, information on epidemics and major health-related incidents, and other health-related information in accordance with law. Furthermore, medical and pharmaceutical advertisements (including advertisements for medical equipment) published by such Websites must not exaggerate the efficacy or promote the medical uses of such products. 
 Sohu Internet, Guangzhou Qianjun, and Sogou Information received renewed SFDA approval on November 26, 2014, April 30, 2014 and October 31, 2017, respectively. 
 Regulation of Online Advertising Services 
 Brand Advertising Services 
 On April 24, 2015, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress enacted the Advertising Law of the Peoples Republic of China (New Advertising Law). The New Advertising Law, which was a major overhaul of an advertising law enacted in 1994, increases the potential legal liability of providers of advertising services, and includes provisions intended to strengthen identification of false advertising and the power of regulatory authorities. On July 4, 2016, the SAIC issued the Interim Measures of the Administration of Online Advertising (the SAIC Interim Measures), effective on September 1, 2016. The New Advertising Law and the SAIC Interim Measures both provide that advertisements posted or published through the Internet may not affect users normal usage of a network, and advertisements published in the form of pop-up windows on the Internet must display a close sign prominently and ensure one-key closing of the pop-up windows. The SAIC Interim Measures provide that all online advertisements must be marked Advertisement so that viewers can easily identify them as such. Moreover, the SAIC Interim Measures treat pay-for-click search results as advertisements that are subject to PRC advertisement laws, require that pay-for-click search results be conspicuously identified on search result pages as advertisements and subject revenues from such advertisements to a 3% PRC tax that is applied to advertising revenues. The New Advertising Law and SAIC Interim Measures will require us to conduct more stringent examination and monitoring of our advertisers and the content of their advertisements. In order to comply with these regulations, Sogou has established more stringent standards for selecting advertisers for pay-for-click services, has turned down certain existing advertisers, and has lowered the percentage that pay-for-click search results represent of results on Sogou search pages. 
 On April 13, 2016, the SAIC and sixteen other PRC government agencies jointly issued a Notice of Campaign to Crack Down on Illegal Internet Finance Advertisements and Other Financial Activities in the Name of Investment Management (the Campaign Notice), pursuant to which a campaign was conducted between April 2016 and January 2017 targeting, among other things, online advertisements for Internet finance and other financial activities posted on Internet search portals and other portal, financial, real estate, P2P and investment product sales services Websites. 
 
25 
 
Search and search-related Services 
 On October 23, 2015, the MOC issued a Notice on Further Strengthening and Improving the Administration of Content of Online Music (the MOC Further Notice) which became effective on January 1, 2016. The MOC Further Notice provides that providing direct links to online music will constitute engaging in the online music business, and that therefore an Online Culture Operating Permit is required for providing such search services. Sogou Information held an Online Culture Operating Permit pursuant to regulations that were in effect before the MOC Further Notice became effective. The permit was renewed on November 3, 2017 pursuant to the MOC Further Notice. 
 On June 25, 2016, the CAOC issued Measures for the Administration of Online Information Search Services (the CAOC Interim Measures), which came into effect on August 1, 2016. The CAOC Interim Measures, like the SAIC Interim Measures, require that providers of online search services verify the credentials of pay-for-click advertisers, specify a maximum percentage that pay-for-click search results may represent of results on a search page, and require that providers of search services conspicuously identify pay-for-click search results as such. 
 Regulation of Online Game Services 
 Online Games and Cultural Products 
 In September 2009, the SAPPRFT, together with the National Copyright Administration and the National Office of Combating Pornography and Illegal Publications, jointly issued a Notice on Further Strengthening the Administration of Pre-examination and Approval of Online Games and the Examination and Approval of Imported Online Games, or the SAPPRFT Online Game Notice. The SAPPRFT Online Game Notice states that foreign investors are not permitted to invest in online game operating businesses in China via wholly foreign-owned entities, China-foreign equity joint ventures or cooperative joint ventures or to exercise control over or participate in the operation of domestic online game businesses through indirect means, such as other joint venture companies or contractual or technical arrangements. If the VIE structures of Sogou and Changyou were deemed under the SAPPRFT Online Game Notice to be an indirect means for foreign investors to exercise control over or participate in the operation of a domestic online game business, the VIE structures of Sogou and Changyou might be challenged by the SAPPRFT. We are not aware of any online game companies which use the same or similar VIE contractual arrangements as those Sogou and Changyou use having been challenged by the SAPPRFT as using those VIE arrangements as an indirect means for foreign investors to exercise control over or participate in the operation of a domestic online game business or having been penalized or ordered to terminate operations since the SAPPRFT Online Game Notice first became effective. However, it is unclear whether and how the SAPPRFT Online Game Notice might be interpreted or implemented in the future. 
 On February 21, 2008, the SAPPRFT issued the Rules for the Administration of Electronic Publications, or the Electronic Publication Rules, which were amended on August 28, 2015. The Electronic Publication Rules regulate the production, publishing and importation of electronic publications in the PRC and outline a licensing system for business operations involving electronic publishing. Under the Electronic Publication Rules and other related regulations issued by the SAPPRFT, online games are classified as a type of electronic publication or Internet publication that may only be provided by a licensed electronic publishing entity with a standard publication code, and the establishment of an electronic publishing entity must be approved by the SAPPRFT. Electronic publishing entities are responsible for assuring that the content of electronic publications comply with relevant PRC law and regulations, and must obtain the approval of the SAPPRFT before publishing foreign electronic publications. The New Internet Publication Measures, which became effective on March 10, 2016 and replaced the Temporary Measures for Internet Publication Administration that had become effective in 2002, require that entities in the Internet publishing business apply for an online publishing services license instead of an Internet publishing license, that entities holding an Internet publishing license apply for an online publishing service license within a specified period of time to replace their Internet publishing license, and that all such entities obtain approval from the SAPPRFT prior to the publication of new online games. In addition, under the New Internet Publication Measures, Sino-foreign joint ventures and foreign-invested entities are not permitted to engage in Internet publication services, and the legal representative of an entity providing Internet publication services may not be a foreigner. 
 Gamease, which is the operator of TLBB, BO, BH2 and certain other licensed PC games, and Guanyou Gamespace, which provides online game services, obtained Internet publishing licenses on December 10, 2010 and October 13, 2011, respectively, and Gamease and Guanyou Gamespace have obtained online publishing services licenses under the New Internet Publication Measures to replace the Internet publishing licenses previously held by them. TLBB, BO, BH2 and some of Changyous other games were historically published through third parties that were licensed electronic publishing entities, because Gamease had not obtained an Internet publishing license at the time those online games were made publicly available. TLBB, BO and BH2 and certain of Changyous other existing games are currently published under an Internet publishing license held by Gamease. Current PRC regulations are not clear as to the consequences of obtaining authorization codes through third-party electronic publishing entities. While we believe that arrangements like Changyous are acknowledged by the SAPPRFT, in view of the lack of formal interpretation regarding this issue, the SAPPRFT might challenge Changyous current and past practices and could subject Changyou to various penalties, including fines, confiscation of publishing equipment and the revenues generated from the publishing activities, the revocation of Changyous business license, or the forced discontinuation of or restrictions on its operations.

On May 24, 2016, the SAPPRFT issued the Mobile Game Notice, which became effective on July 1, 2016 and sets forth requirements for the publication and operation of mobile games online, including requiring that mobile game publishers and operators, including joint operators, review the content of the games that they publish and operate, and apply for publication and authorization codes at least 20 business days before first publishing and operating domestic recreational and educational mobile games through open beta testing. The Mobile Game Notice, as updated by a subsequent notice, specifies that game publishers and game operators were required to review the content of mobile games that were published and operated online before July 1, 2016, and to complete approval procedures for those games before December 31, 2016, or to cease operating the games. Changyou completed prior to December 31, 2016 all of the approval procedures required by the SAPPRFT for its mobile games that were in operation before July 1, 2016. 
 The MOC issued the New Provisional Regulations for the Administration of Online Culture, or the Online Culture Regulations, which took effect on April 1, 2011 and replaced the Provisional Regulations for the Administration of Online Culture. The Online Culture Regulations apply to entities engaging in activities related to Internet cultural products, which include cultural products that are produced specifically for Internet use, such as online music and entertainment, online games, online plays, online performances, online works of art and Web animation, and other online cultural products that through technical means, produce or reproduce music, entertainment, games, plays and other art works for Internet dissemination. Under the New Online Culture Regulations, commercial entities are required to apply to the relevant local branch of the MOC for an Online Culture Operating Permit if they engage in the production, duplication, importation, release or broadcasting of Internet cultural products; the dissemination of online cultural products on the Internet or the transmission of such products via Internet or mobile phone networks to user terminals, such as computers, phones, television sets and gaming consoles, or Internet surfing service sites such as Internet cafés; or the holding or exhibition of contests related to Internet cultural products. In January 2008 Gamease obtained an Online Culture Operating Permit, which was re-certified in October 2015 and December 2017; in June 2011 Guanyou Gamespace obtained an Online Culture Operating Permit, which was re-certified in October 2015 and December 2017; and in December 2010 Shanghai ICE obtained an Online Culture Operating Permit, which was re-certified in January 2014. Shanghai ICE plans to apply for re-certification of its Online Culture Operating Permit in March 2018. 
 The Online Game Measures issued by the MOC, which took effect on August 1, 2010, regulate a broad range of activities related to the online games business, including the development, production and operation of online games, the issuance of virtual currencies used for online games, and the provision of virtual currency trading services. The Online Game Measures provide that any entity that is engaged in online game operations must obtain an Online Culture Operating Permit, and require the content of an imported online game to be examined and approved by the MOC prior to the games launch and a domestic online game to be filed with the MOC within 30 days after its launch. The Notice of the Ministry of Culture on the Implementation of the Interim Measures for the Administration of Online Games, which was issued by the MOC on July 29, 2010 to implement the Online Game Measures (i) requires online game operators to protect the interests of online game users and specifies certain terms that must be included in service agreements between online game operators and the users of their online games, (ii) specifies content review of imported online games and filing procedures for domestic online games, (iii) emphasizes the importance of the protection of minors playing online games, and (iv) requests online game operators to promote real-name registration by their game users. On December 1, 2016, the MOC issued the Online Game Operation Notice, which became effective on May 1, 2017. The Online Game Operation Notice includes clarification of products and services that will be considered to be within the scope of the operation of online games, enhanced standards for the issuance of and payment for virtual items used in online games and enhanced protection of online games users, and announces more stringent supervision of the operation of online games and penalties for violations by online game operators of regulations with respect to the operation of online games. The Online Game Operation Notice stipulates that game operators are prohibited from providing lucky draws or lotteries that are conducted on the condition that participants contribute cash or virtual currency in exchange for virtual items and services; must timely publish the name, properties, description, amount, and probability of winning for such lucky draws or lotteries on either the Website of the game or the Web page on which such lucky draws or lotteries are provided; must require real-name registration of game players who wish to enter such lucky draws or lotteries; and must publish the results of such lucky draws or lotteries on the Website of or other conspicuous location in the game; and must maintain all relevant records for at least 90 days. The Online Game Operation Notice also stipulates that online game operators must require real-name registration of online game players and may sell game points and virtual items only to real-name registered game players, must set limits on the maximum amount of game points for a particular game that game players may purchase in a single transaction, must require confirmation of transaction information by game players placing orders and maintain all relevant records for at least 180 days. Changyou filed its games TLBB, BO, BH2, and certain of its other existing games with the MOC. If Changyou fails to maintain any of its permits, approvals, or registrations; make any necessary filings; apply for and obtain any required new permits, approvals, or registrations; make any new filings on a timely basis; or comply with the requirements under the Online Game Operation Notice and other laws and regulations, it may be subject to various penalties, including fines and a requirement that it discontinue or limit its operations.

The Notice on Strengthening the Approval and Administration of Imported Online Games, or the Imported Online Game Notice, which was issued by the SAPPRFT and took effect in July 2009, states that the SAPPRFT is the only governmental department authorized by the State Council to approve the importation of online games from offshore copyright owners, and that any enterprise which engages in online game publication and operation services within China must have the game examined and approved by the SAPPRFT and receive from the SAPPRFT an Internet publishing license (or after the New Internet Publication Measures became effective on March 10, 2016, an online publishing services license). Changyous VIEs Gamease and Guanyou Gamespace obtained Internet publishing licenses from the SAPPRFT and they have obtained online publishing services licenses under the New Internet Publication Measures to replace the Internet publishing licenses previously held by them. In addition, the Imported Online Game Notice states that activities which involve the showing, exhibition, trading and promotion of offshore online games in China must be examined and approved by the SAPPRFT. 
 The Notice Regarding Improving and Strengthening the Administration of Online Game Content, or the Online Game Content Notice, issued by the MOC in November 2009, calls for online game operators to improve and adapt their game models by (i) mitigating the predominance of the upgrade by monster fighting model, (ii) limiting the use of the player kill model (where one players character attempts to kill another players character), (iii) limiting in-game marriages among game players, and (iv) improving their compliance with legal requirements for the registration of minors and game time-limits. 
 The Administrative Measures for Content Self-review by Internet Culture Business Entities, or the Content Self-review Administrative Measure, which took effect in December 2013, require Internet culture business entities to review the content of products and services to be provided prior to providing such content and services to the public. The content management system of an Internet culture business entity is required to specify the responsibilities, standards and processes for content review as well as accountability measures, and is required be filed with the local provincial branch of the MOC. 
 In January 2014, the SAIC promulgated the Administrative Measures for Online Trading, or the Online Trading Measures, which took effect on March 15, 2014, and replaced the Interim Measures for the Administration of Online Commodities Trading and Relevant Services, issued by the SAIC, which had taken effect on July 1, 2010. The Online Trading Measures regulate online commodity trading and related activities. The Online Trading Measures require that online transactions in commodities or services comply with the provisions of all applicable laws, regulations and rules. When selling commodities or providing services to consumers, online operators must comply with all applicable laws with respect to the protection of consumer rights and interests, the protection of intellectual property rights of others and the prevention of unfair competition. Information provided with respect to commodities and services provided by online commodity operators or related service operators must be authentic and accurate. If Changyou fails to comply with all requirements of the Online Trading Measures, the local branch of the SAIC or another governmental authority with jurisdiction might impose penalties on it, such as fines. 
Registration of Software Copyrights 
 The Measures Concerning Registration of Computer Software Copyright, or the Software Copyright Measures, issued by the National Copyright Administration, which became effective in February 2002, encourage the registration of software and afford greater protection to registered software than that afforded to unregistered software. Changyou has registered software copyrights covering all of its significant copyrightable products and enhancements. 
Regulation of Internet Content 
 The PRC government has promulgated measures relating to Internet content through a number of government authorities, including the MIIT, the MOC, the SAPPRFT and the MPS. These measures prohibit certain Internet activities, including the operation of online games that result in the publication of any content which is found to, among other things, propagate obscenity, gambling or violence, instigate crimes, undermine public morality or the cultural traditions of the PRC, or compromise State security or secrets. If an ICP license holder violates these measures, the PRC government may revoke its ICP license and shut down its Websites. 
 On May 2, 2017, the CAOC, issued the Administrative Enforcement Procedures for the Administration of Internet-based Information Content, or the Enforcement Procedures, effective June 1, 2017. Pursuant to the Enforcement Procedures, the CAOC and its local branch offices have the authority to enforce, and impose administrative sanctions on activities prohibited by, applicable administrative laws and regulations concerning Internet-based information content.

Protection of Minors 
 On April 15, 2007, the SAPPRFT and several other governmental authorities issued a circular requiring the implementation of an anti-fatigue system and a real-name registration system by all PRC online game operators, in an effort to curb addictive online game play behaviors of minors. Under the anti-fatigue system, three hours or less of continuous play by minors is considered to be healthy, three to five hours to be fatiguing, and five hours or more to be unhealthy. Game operators are required to reduce the value of in-game benefits to a game player by half if the game player has reached fatiguing level, and to zero in the case of unhealthy level. 
 To identify whether a game player is a minor and thus subject to the anti-fatigue system, there was adopted a real-name registration system, which requires online game players to register their real identity information before they play online games and requires online game operators such as Sogou and Changyou to submit the identity information of game players to the public security authorities for verification. On July 1, 2011, the SAPPRFT, the MIIT, the Ministry of Education and five other governmental authorities issued a Notice on Initializing the verification of Real-name Registration for Anti-Fatigue System on Internet Games, or the Real-name Registration Notice), which took effect on October 1, 2011, to strengthen the implementation of the anti-fatigue system and real-name registration. The Real-name Registration Notices main focus is to prevent minors from using an adults ID to play Internet games and, accordingly, the notice imposes stringent punishments on online game operators that do not implement the required anti-fatigue and real-name registration measures properly and effectively. The most severe punishment contemplated by the Real-name Registration Notice is to require termination of the operation of the online game if it is found to be in violation of the Anti-Fatigue Notice, the Monitor System Circular or the Real-name Registration Notice. Sogou and Changyou developed anti-fatigue and real-name registration systems for their games, and implemented them beginning in 2007. Under the systems of Sogou and Changyou, game players must use real identification in order to create accounts, and in this way Sogou and Changyou generally are able to tell which of their game players are minors and thus subject to these regulations. For game players who do not register, Sogou and Changyou assume that they are minors. As required by the anti-fatigue rules, Changyou reduces the value of in-game benefits of game players under 18 years based on the amount of their continuous play. In order to comply with the anti-fatigue rules, game players under 18 years of age only receive half of the experience time they actually earn after three hours of play. And, after five hours of play, minors receive no experience points. Sogou uses this system to disincentivize minors from playing in excess of five hours at a time. 
 On January 15, 2011, the MOC, the MIIT and six other central government authorities jointly issued a circular entitled Implementation of Online Game Monitor System of the Guardians of Minors, or the Monitor System Circular, aiming to provide protection measures to monitor the online game activities of minors and curb addictive online game playing behaviors of minors. Under the Monitor System Circular, online game operators are required to adopt various measures to maintain a system to communicate with the parents or other guardians of minors playing online games and online game operators are required to monitor the online game activities of minors, and must suspend the account of a minor if so requested by the minors parents or guardians. The monitor system was formally implemented commencing March 1, 2011. 
 In February 2013, 15 PRC government authorities, including the SAPPRFT, the Ministry of Education, the MOC and the MIIT, jointly issued the Work Plan for the Integrated Prevention of Minors Online Game Addiction, or the Work Plan, implementing integrated measures by different authorities to prevent minors from being addicted to online games. Under the Work Plan, the current relevant regulations regarding online games will be further clarified and additional implementation rules will be issued; and as a result, online game operators will be required to implement measures to protect minors. 
 On July 25, 2014, the SAPPRFT promulgated a Notice on Further Carrying out the Verification of Real-name Registration for Anti-Fatigue System on Internet Games, or the Verification of Real-name Registration Notice, which took effect on October 1, 2014. The Verification of Real-name Registration Notice requires local press and publication administrative departments to strengthen their administration over enterprises engaged in online game publication and operations, and requires such enterprises to abide by anti-fatigue and real-name registration requirements when developing and promoting online games, excluding, at present, mobile games.

Information Security and Censorship 
 Internet content in China is also regulated and restricted from a State security standpoint. The Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress enacted the Decision on Internet Security Protection in 2000, and amended it in August, 2009. The decision makes it unlawful to: (i) gain improper entry into a computer or system of strategic importance; (ii) disseminate politically disruptive information; (iii) leak State secrets; (iv) spread false commercial information; or (v) infringe intellectual property rights. The MPS has promulgated measures that prohibit the use of the Internet in ways which, among other things, result in a leakage of State secrets or distribution of socially destabilizing content. The MPS has supervision and inspection rights in this regard, and Changyou may be subject to the jurisdiction of local security bureaus. If an ICP license holder violates these measures, the PRC government may revoke its ICP license and shut down its Websites. On November 7, 2016, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress issued the Internet Security Law, which took effect on June 1, 2017. The Internet Security Law requires providers of services over Internet networks to keep user information that they have collected in strict confidence and to establish improved systems for the protection of user information. Such service providers must provide notice of the purpose, methods and scope of their collection and use of user information, and obtain the consent of each person whose personal information will be collected. Service providers may not collect any personal information that is not related to the services they provide, or disclose or tamper with personal information that they have collected, unless such information is encoded to prevent identification of individuals whose information is so disclosed or tampered with. Service providers who do not comply with the Internet Security Law may be subject to fines, suspension of their businesses, shutdown of their websites, and revocation of their business licenses.
 In 2004, the MOC issued a Notice Regarding the Strengthening of Online Game Censorship. This notice mandates the establishment of a new committee under the MOC that will screen the content of imported online games. In addition, all imported and domestic online games are required to be filed with the MOC. Changyou has submitted the relevant documents to the MOC for the filing of all of its online games in operation. 
 In 2005, the MOC and the MIIT promulgated the Opinions on the Development and Administration of Online Games emphasizing the PRC governments intent to foster and control the development of the online game industry in China and providing that the MOC will censor online games that threaten state security, disturb the social order, or contain obscenity or violence. 
 In April, 2009, the MOC issued a Public Announcement on Regulating Applications for the Examination of the Content of Imported Online Games, or the Announcement. The Announcement emphasizes that enterprises operating imported online games must have the content of those games examined and approved by the MOC. 
 Virtual Currency 
 On February 15, 2007, the MOC, the the Peoples Bank of China, or the PBOC, and other relevant government authorities jointly issued the Notice on the Reinforcement of the Administration of Internet Cafés and Online Games, or the Internet Cafés Notice. Under the Internet Cafés Notice, the PBOC is directed to strengthen the administration of virtual currency in online games to avoid any adverse impact on the economy and financial system. The Internet Cafés Notice limits the total amount of virtual currency that may be issued by online game operators and the amount that may be purchased by individual game players, and includes a clear division between virtual transactions and real transactions carried out by way of electronic commerce. The Internet Cafés Notice also provides that virtual currency may only be used to purchase virtual items. 
 On June 4, 2009, the MOC and the MOFCOM jointly issued the Virtual Currency Notice, to regulate the trading of online game virtual currencies. The Virtual Currency Notice defines the meaning of virtual currency and places a set of restrictions on the trading and issuance of virtual currency. The Virtual Currency Notice also states that online game operators are not allowed to give out virtual items or virtual currency through lottery-based activities, such as lucky draws, betting or random computer sampling, in exchange for users cash or virtual money. The Virtual Currency Notice is mainly targeted at lottery-based activities relating to the treasure boxes found in some online games. 
 On July 20, 2009, the MOC promulgated the Filing Guidelines for Online Game Virtual Currency Issuing Enterprises and Online Game Virtual Currency Trading Enterprises, which define the terms issuing enterprise and trading enterprise and stipulate that the same enterprise may not be both an issuing enterprise and a trading enterprise. 
 
30 
 
On December 1, 2016, the MOC issued the Online Game Operation Notice, which became effective on May 1, 2017. The Online Game Operation Notice standardizes rules regarding the issuance of virtual items used for online games. The Online Game Operation Notice provides that the issuance and exchange of virtual items issued by online game operators must be administered in accordance with the regulations applicable to virtual currency; that online game operators may not allow online game virtual currency to be exchanged for real currency or physical items, except that, when online game operators cease offering their online game products and services to users, the operators may repay the users with real currency or other actual physical or intangible assets for unused virtual currency; requires that, when online game operators allow users to exchange small-value physical items for virtual items, the content and value of such physical items must comply with applicable laws and regulations; and stipulates that online game operators are prohibited from providing lucky draws or lotteries that are conducted on the condition that participants contribute cash or virtual currencies in exchange for virtual items and services, must publish the results of such lucky draws or lotteries on the Website of or other conspicuous location in the game and must maintain all relevant records for at least 90 days. 
 Import and Export of Software Technology 
 China imposes controls on the import and export of technology and software products. Under the Regulations on Administration of Import and Export of Technologies promulgated by the State Council, the term technology import and export is defined to include, among other things, the transfer or licensing of patents and know-how, and the provision of services related to technology. Depending on the nature of the relevant technology, the import and export of technology require either approval by or registration with the relevant PRC governmental authorities. Under the Software Export Management and Statistics Measures promulgated in October 2001, if a company is classified as a software enterprise and has a minimum of RMB1 million (or approximately $158,000) in registered capital, it may engage in an export business after being registered with the relevant PRC governmental authorities. All contracts which relate to the export of software products, transfer of technology or provision of related services must be filed with the relevant PRC governmental authorities. The Measures for the Administration of Registration of Technology Import and Export Contracts, issued by the MOFCOM in February 2009, specify registration requirements related to the import and export of technology. 
 Changyou has entered into license agreements with third parties outside of China to license its games, which may be deemed to constitute the export of technology under the regulations. As a result, such licenses are required to be registered with applicable PRC governmental authorities. Although there are no explicit penalties set forth in these regulations for lack of such registration, failure to register an agreement where such registration is required may result in restrictions concerning foreign exchange, banking and taxation matters relating to such agreements. Changyou has not registered all of the game license agreements under which it authorizes overseas third-party online game operators to operate its online games, and so far Changyou has not encountered any problems with respect to foreign exchange, banking or taxation matters relating to its license agreements, nor has Changyou received any notice from any governmental authority requiring it to complete the registration of its game license agreements. 
 Regulation of Other Services 
 Real Estate Services 
 On March 10, 2015, the National Development and Reform Commission (the NDRC) and the MOFCOM issued a new Foreign Investment Industrial Guidance Catalogue (the New Catalogue), which became effective on April 10, 2015 and was amended on June 28, 2017. The New Catalogue removed from the category of industries where foreign investment is restricted real estate agency and brokerage services, which had been included in the restricted category in the previous Foreign Investment Industrial Guidance Catalogue issued in 2011. The New Catalogue loosened existing restrictions on foreign ownership of real estate agency and brokerage services in China, and as a result we may conduct real estate agency and brokerage services directly. 
 On April 4, 2001, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (the MHURD, formerly the Ministry of Construction) promulgated the Regulatory Measures on the Sale of Commercial Houses, pursuant to which a real estate developer may engage a real estate services organization as a broker to pre-sell or sell primary residential housing. The regulatory measures provide that a real estate broker must not make any false statements regarding a property to clients and must present clients with relevant title certificates or sale permits for the properties and a related letter of authorization. 
 On December 29, 2006, the MHURD and the PBOC jointly issued the Circular Concerning Strengthening the Management of Real Estate Services and Regulating the Trade Settlement Capital Account, which provides a number of directives regulating the real estate services industry. Under the circular, a real estate services company is not permitted to receive cash purchase payments on behalf of clients in secondary real estate transactions and is required to establish separate security deposit accounts for clients. 
 
31 
 
On January 20, 2011, MHURD, the NDRC, and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security jointly issued the Measures for Administration on Real Estate Brokerage (the Brokerage Measures), which became effective on April 1, 2011 and were amended on April 1, 2016, and govern the activities of real estate brokerages and real estate brokerage personnel in providing intermediary, agency and related services and charging commissions. Furthermore, pursuant to the Brokerage Measures, a real estate brokerage company and its branches must have a sufficient number of licensed real estate brokers. The Brokerage Measures also require real estate brokerage companies to file with real estate regulatory authorities at the county level or above within 30 days after their business registration with the relevant local counterparts of the SAIC. Focus Interactive has made the required filings. 
 On July 29, 2016, the MHURD and six other governmental authorities jointly issued the Opinions on Strengthening the Administration of Sound Development of Real Estate Brokerage (the MHURD Opinions), to further regulate real estate brokerage services. The MHURD Opinions stipulate that real estate brokers are obligated to censor specified real estate-related information, including ownership, price, area, and location, and may not provide, directly or through agencies, loans for down payments and other similar financial services. 
 On September 30, 2016, Beijing MHURD and five other governmental authorities jointly issued the Measures for the Promotion of Stable and Healthy Development of the Local Real Estate Market (the Beijing Measures), with the goal of tempering rampant increases in housing prices by balancing land supply in favor of residential use and owner-occupied apartments, providing guidance for real estate developers and brokers as to the setting of prices and the conduct of advertising, selling and financing activities, and providing for enhanced enforcement measures with respect to false and misleading advertisements and pricing information and other illegal selling and financing activities in the local real estate market. Certain other cities, including Tianjin, Suzhou, Zhengzhou, Chengdu, Hefei, and Wuhan, adopted similar measures. One effect of these regulations has been to make real estate developers more cautious with respect to advertising housing on Internet platforms and cooperating on real estate-related e-commerce programs with Internet service providers such as us. In some cases, our real estate developer clients have suspended or discontinued their collaboration with us on our program that allows our users to purchase Focus membership cards and later purchase real estate properties from the real estate developers at a discount greater than the price of the membership cards, and as a result users have asked us to reimburse them for the fees for their cards. 
 Online Payment Services 
 On June 14, 2010, the PBOC issued the Measures for the Administration of Payment Services Provided by Non-financial Institutions (the Payment Services Measures), which took effect on September 1, 2010 and were amended on February 3, 2016. On December 1, 2010, the PBOC promulgated the Implementing Rules for the Payment Services Measures. The Payment Services Measures and their implementing rules require any non-financial institution engaging in payment services, such as online payments, issuance and acceptance of prepaid cards, and bill collection via bank cards, to obtain a Payment Service License. Applications for Payment Service Licenses are examined by the local branches of the PBOC and then submitted to the PBOC for approval. To further regulate the operation of online payment services, the PBOC issued the Administration of Online Payment Services Provided by Non-Bank Payment Institutions (the Online Payment Services Measures), which took effect on July 1, 2016. The Online Payment Services Measures classify personal payment accounts at entities that already hold a Payment Service License into three categories based on the extent to which the holders of the accounts have completed identity verification procedures, and provide that those account holders who have completed more of the identity verification process are entitled to a broader range of payment options through their accounts. The Online Payment Services Measures prohibit non-bank payment institutions from engaging in securities, insurance, financing, trusts and other unauthorized financial business. Non-bank payment institutions are also required to develop risk control systems, including a risk rating system for users, a dispute resolution system, and a risk reserve. 
 In addition, on January 20, 2015, the SAFE issued the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on the Pilot Scheme of Cross-border Foreign Exchange Payment Services Provided by Payment Institutions (the Pilot Notice), replacing the Guiding Opinions on the Pilot Services of Cross-Border E-commerce Foreign Exchange Payment by Payment Institutions issued by the SAFE on February 1, 2013, pursuant to which a payment institution is required to obtain approval from the SAFE and to be registered in the Enterprise Directory for Foreign Exchange Receipts and Payments in Trade in order to provide pilot foreign exchange payment services for cross-border e-commerce transactions. Any institution applying for such registration and approval must first obtain a Payment Services License that authorizes it to engage in the online payments business.

Lottery Sales 
 On May 4, 2009, the State Council issued the Regulation on Administration of Lottery stating that lottery issuance agencies and lottery sales agencies may authorize other entities to conduct lottery sales. On September 26, 2010, the Ministry of Finance (the MOF) issued the Interim Measures on the Administration of Internet Lottery Sale (the Lottery Measures), which set forth detailed requirements for the administration of online lottery sales as well as requirements for qualified online lottery service providers. Pursuant to the Lottery Measures, the MOF is the supervisory and regulatory department for online lottery sales. Lottery issuance agencies may collaborate with other entities or authorize lottery sales agencies to conduct online lottery sales, or appoint qualified entities as their online lottery sales agents. The Lottery Measures require qualified online lottery service providers to meet certain criteria, including having obtained an Internet content provider license. Lottery issuance agencies are required to apply to the MOF for approval of online lottery service providers that the lottery service agencies propose to engage to conduct an online lottery business. 
 On January 18, 2012, the MOF, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the General Administration of Sports jointly issued the Implementing Rules of the Regulation on Administration of Lottery (the Lottery Implementing Rules), which became effective on March 1, 2012 and stipulate that lotteries sold without the MOFs approval and a lottery issuing agencys or a lottery sales agencys authorization may be categorized as illegal lotteries. 
 On February 28, 2012, the General Administration of Sports issued the Urgent Notice on the Strengthening Execution of the Lottery Implementing Rules, reiterating that lotteries sold via the Internet without the approval of the MOF will be deemed to be illegal lotteries. In December 2012, the MOF issued the Lottery Distribution and Sale Administration Measures, which became effective on January 1, 2013 and expressly permit Internet lottery sales. 
 On March 27, 2014, the MOF issued the Interim Measures on the Administration of the Sale of Lotteries via Telephone (the Telephone Lottery Measures) to replace the MOFs former version promulgated on September 26, 2010. Under the Telephone Lottery Measures, sale of lotteries via telephone refers to the use of fixed-line telephones and mobile telephones to sell lotteries through short messages, voice calls and applications. Properly qualified lottery sales agencies may authorize other entities (Telephone Sales Agents) to carry out the business of sale of lotteries via telephone. The lottery sales agencies and the Telephone Sales Agent must enter into a commission agreement. A qualified Telephone Sales Agent is required to meet certain criteria, including having obtained a Value-Added Telecommunications Services Operating License. The Telephone Lottery Measures further provide that a Telephone Sales Agent must conduct business in accordance with parameters approved by the MOF and an pursuant to a commission agreement. 
 On January 15, 2015, the MOF, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the General Administration of Sports jointly promulgated the Notice related to Self-inspection and Self-Remedy of Unauthorized Online Lottery Sales (the Self-inspection Notice), which requires provincial and municipal government branches, including financial, civil affairs and sports bureaus, to conduct inspections and take remedial measures for unauthorized online lottery sales within their respective jurisdictions. The scope of inspection includes, among other things, commission contracts, online lottery products, exchange of lottery sales data, online lottery sales channels, and sales commission fees in connection with unauthorized engagements of online sales agents by lottery sales agencies. The Notice further requires that a formal report on the result of the inspections and the remedial measures be submitted by each provincial or municipal government to the MOF, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the General Administration of Sports by March 1, 2015. 
 On April 3, 2015, eight governmental authorities consisting of the MOF, the MPS, the SAIC, the MIIT, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the PBOC, the General Administration of Sports and the China Banking Regulatory Commission jointly released a public announcement with regard to unauthorized online lottery sales (the Public Announcement). The Public Announcement provides, among other things, that (i) all lottery institutions, internet companies, and other institutions or individuals provide unauthorized online lottery sales services, either directly or through agents, must immediately cease such services; (ii) the local governmental authorities for finance, civil affairs and sports must investigate and sanction unauthorized online lottery sales in their respective jurisdictions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations; (iii) the local governmental authorities for public security and industry and commerce must investigate any issuances or sales of illegal lotteries within their respective jurisdictions, with necessary assistance from local governmental authorities for finance, communication, banking regulation, civil affairs and sports, and local branches of the PBOC, and report any criminal activities to judicial authorities for prosecution; (iv) the lottery issuance authorities that plan to sell lottery products online must obtain approval from the Ministry of Civil Affairs or the General Administration of Sports by submitting an application to the MOF for written approval, and (v) no entity may provide online lottery sales services without the approval of the MOF. On April 28, 2016, the MOF, the MPS, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the General Administration of Sports, and the SAIC, and on May 5, 2015 the SAIC, issued notices regarding unauthorized online lottery sales and further emphasized the requirements specified in the Public Announcement. Online lottery sales are an insignificant business for us.

Production of Radio and Telecommunications Equipment 
 On September 11, 1993, the State Council and Central Military Commission jointly issued the Regulations on the Management of Radio Operations, which were amended on November 11, 2016, under which the working frequencies, bands, and related technical indices of radio transmission equipment must conform to relevant regulations regarding radio and are required to be submitted to the state radio administration authority or its local branches. Pursuant to the Regulation on the Penalties of Radio Management issued by the State Radio Regulatory Bureau (formerly the State Radio Regulatory Commission) on October 28, 1995, failure to submit such information will result in the imposition of a fine. 
 On October 7, 1997, the State Radio Regulatory Bureau (formerly the State Radio Regulatory Commission), together with the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (formerly the State Bureau of Quality) promulgated Regulations on the Production of Radio Transmitting Equipment (the Radio Transmitting Equipment Regulations) ,which took effect on January 1,1999. Pursuant to the Radio Transmitting Equipment Regulations, each type of radio transmission equipment is subject to approval from State Radio Regulatory Bureau (SRRC Certificate) prior to production. 
 On May 10, 2001, MIIT promulgated the Administration Measures of the Network Entry of Telecommunication Equipment (the Telecommunication Equipment Measures), which was amended on September 23, 2014. Pursuant to the Telecommunication Equipment Measures, the State requires all telecommunications terminal equipment to be connected to a public telecommunications network to obtain network connection permits. A Permit of Network Connection, or China Type Approval Certificate (CTA Certificate), issued by the MIIT must be obtained for such telecommunications equipment. When a producer of such telecommunications terminal equipment applies for a CTA Certificate, it must submit a test report or product quality certificate (namely SRRC Certificate). If a CTA Certificate has not been obtained for such equipment, it may not be connected to a public telecommunications network and may not be used or sold domestically.

 Laws and Regulations Related to Intellectual Property Protection 
 China has adopted comprehensive legislation governing intellectual property rights, including copyrights, patents and trademarks. 
 Copyright 
 On September 7, 1990, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress promulgated the Copyright Law, which took effect on June 1, 1991 and was amended in 2001 and in 2010. The amended Copyright Law extends copyright protection to Internet activities, products disseminated over the Internet and software products. In addition, there is a voluntary registration system administered by the China Copyright Protection Center. The amended Copyright Law also requires registration of the pledge of a copyright. 
 
34 
 
In order to further implement the Computer Software Protection Regulations, promulgated by the State Council on December 20, 2001 and amended on January 30, 2013, the National Copyright Administration (the NCA) issued Computer Software Copyright Registration Procedures on February 20, 2002, which specify detailed procedures and requirements with respect to the registration of software copyrights. 
 To address the problem of copyright infringement related to content posted or transmitted over the Internet, on April 29, 2005 the NCA and the MIIT jointly promulgated the Measures for Administrative Protection of Copyright Related to Internet, which became effective on May 30, 2005. These measures apply to situations where an ICP operator (i) allows another person to post or store any works, recordings, audio or video programs on the Websites operated by such ICP operator, or (ii) provides links to, or search results for, the works, recordings, audio or video programs posted or transmitted by such person, without editing, revising or selecting the content of such material. Upon receipt of an infringement notice from a legitimate copyright holder, an ICP operator must take remedial actions immediately by removing or disabling access to the infringing content. If an ICP operator knowingly transmits infringing content or fails to take remedial actions after receipt of a notice of infringement harming public interest, the ICP operator could be subject to administrative penalties, including an order to cease infringing activities; confiscation by the authorities of all income derived from the infringement activities; or payment of fines. 
 On May 18, 2006, the State Council promulgated the Regulations on the Protection of the Right to Network Dissemination of Information (as amended in 2013). Under these regulations, an owner of the network dissemination rights with respect to written works or audio or video recordings who believes that information storage, search or link services provided by an Internet service provider infringe his or her rights may require that the Internet service provider delete, or disconnect the links to, such works or recordings. 
 Since 2005, the NCA, together with certain other PRC governmental authorities, have jointly launched annual campaigns, which normally last for three to four months every year, specifically aiming to crack down on Internet copyright infringement and piracy in China. According to the Notice of 2010 Campaign to Crack Down on Internet Infringement and Piracy promulgated by the NCA, the MPS and the MIIT on July 19, 2010, one of the main targets, among others, of the 2010 campaign was Internet audio and video programs. From the time the 2010 campaign commenced in late July, the local branches of the NCA focused on popular movies and television series, newly published books, online games and animation, music and software and illegal uploading or transmission of a third partys works without proper license or permission, sales of pirated audio/video and software through e-commerce platforms, providing search links, information storage, Web hosting or Internet access services for third parties engaging in copyright infringement or piracy and infringement by the use of mobile media. In serious cases, the operating permits of the Websites engaging in illegal activities may be revoked, and such Websites may be ordered to shut down. On July 25, 2017, the NCA, the CAOC, the MIIT and the MPS jointly announced a 2017 campaign to crack down on copyright infringement on the Internet (the Jian Wang 2017 Campaign) with the purpose of providing copyright protection for the news publication, film, and television industries related to material disseminated over the Internet, and focusing on regulation of e-commerce platforms and mobile Internet application programs use of copyrighted material. 
 On April 17, 2015, the NCA issued the Circular on Regulating the Order of Internet Reproduction of Copyrighted Works (Internet Reproduction Circular). Under the Internet Reproduction Circular, in order to reproduce the work of others, Internet media companies must comply with relevant provisions of the copyright laws and regulations, and, unless provided otherwise by law or regulation, must obtain permission from and pay remuneration to the owner of the copyright to the work, and must indicate the name of the author, as well as the title and the source of the work, and may not infringe any other rights or interests of the copyright owner. Moreover, when reproducing the work of others, Internet media companies may not make material alterations to the content; and may not make editorial modifications or abridgments of the work that change the works title or its original intent. When reproducing the work of others, we will need to comply with these strict requirements of the Internet Reproduction Circular. 
 We have adopted measures to mitigate copyright infringement risks, such as real-time monitoring and mechanisms for fast removal upon receipt of notices of infringement. 
 On December 26, 2009, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress adopted the Torts Liability Law, which became effective on July 1, 2010. Under this new law, both Internet users and Internet service providers may be liable for the wrongful acts of users who infringe the lawful rights of other parties. If an Internet user utilizes Internet services to commit a tortious act, the party whose rights are infringed may request the Internet service provider to take measures, such as removing or blocking the content, or disabling the links thereto, to prevent or stop the infringement. If the Internet service provider does not take necessary measures after receiving such a notice, it will be jointly liable for any further damages suffered by the rights holder. Furthermore, if an Internet service provider fails to take necessary measures when it knows that an Internet user utilizes its Internet services to infringe the lawful rights and interests of other parties, it will be jointly liable with the Internet user for damages resulting from the infringement. 
 
35 
 
On December 17, 2012, PRC Supreme Peoples Court promulgated the Provisions on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law for Trial of Civil Dispute Cases Involving Infringement of the Right to Network Dissemination of Information (Network Dissemination of Information Provision). The Network Dissemination of Information Provisions stipulate that the dissemination by network users or network service providers of written works, performance or audio or video recordings without the permission of the holder of the rights to such dissemination will constitute infringement of such rights, and that network service providers that aid or abet any network users infringement of the rights of another to network dissemination of any works or recordings may be liable for such network users infringing activities. 
Patent Law 
 On March 12, 1984, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress promulgated the Patent Law, which was amended in 1992, 2000 and 2008. On June 15, 2001, the State Council promulgated the Implementation Regulation for the Patent Law, which was amended in January 9, 2010. According to these laws and regulations, the State Intellectual Property Office is responsible for administering patents in the PRC. The Chinese patent system adopts a first to file principle, which means that where more than one person files a patent application for the same invention, a patent will be granted to the person who filed the application first. To be patentable, invention or utility models must meet three conditions: novelty, inventiveness and practical applicability. A patent is valid for 20 years in the case of an invention and 10 years in the case of utility models and designs. A third-party user must obtain consent or a proper license from the patent owner to use the patent. Otherwise, third-party use constitutes an infringement of patent rights. 
Trademark Law 
 On August 23, 1982, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress promulgated the Trademark Law (the Trademark Law), which was amended in 1993, 2001 and 2013. On September 15, 2002, the State Council promulgated the Implementation Regulation for the Trademark Law, which was amended in April 29, 2014. Under the Trademark Law and the implementing regulation, the Trademark Office of the Administration for Industry and Commerce is responsible for the registration and administration of trademarks. The Administration for Industry and Commerce under the State Council has established a Trademark Review and Adjudication Board for resolving trademark disputes. As with patents, China has adopted a first-to-file principle for trademark registration. If two or more applicants apply for registration of identical or similar trademarks for the same or similar commodities, the application that was filed first will receive preliminary approval and will be publicly announced. For applications filed on the same day, the trademark that was first used will receive preliminary approval and will be publicly announced. Registered trademarks are valid for ten years from the date the registration is approved. A registrant may apply to renew a registration within twelve months before the expiration date of the registration. If the registrant fails to apply in a timely manner, a grace period of six additional months may be granted. If the registrant fails to apply before the grace period expires, the registered trademark shall be deregistered. Renewed registrations are valid for ten years. 
Laws and Regulations Related to Encryption Software 
 In October 1999, the State Council promulgated the Regulations for the Administration of Commercial Encryption, amended on February 3, 2016, followed in November 1999 by the Notice of the General Office of the State Encryption Administration Commission promulgated by the State Commission for the Administration of Cryptography. Both of these regulations address the use in China of software with encryption functions. 
 These regulations require that encryption products purchased for use be reported. Violation of the encryption regulations may result in the issuance of a warning, levying of a penalty, confiscation of the encryption products and even criminal liabilities. On March 18, 2000, the Office of the State Commission for the Administration of Cryptography issued a public announcement regarding the implementation of the regulations. The announcement states that only specialized hardware and software, the core functions of which are encryption and decoding, fall within the administrative scope of the regulations as encryption products and equipment containing encryption technology. Other products, such as wireless telephone, Windows software and browsers do not fall within this scope. 
 The State Commission for the Administration of Cryptography changed its name to the State Cryptography Administration Bureau (SCAB) in March 2005. The SCAB maintains authority over the importation, research, production, sale and use of cryptographic products in China (products are defined to include any cryptographic technologies and products to be applied in the encryption or secure authentication of information, other than state secrets). Legislation was issued to restrict the importation, research, production and sale of encryption products and requiring that the encryption functions of such products be placed in escrow with the SCAB for reasons of national security. 
 
36 
 
We are in full compliance with current PRC legislation governing encryption software. 
 Laws and Regulations Related to Consumer Protection and Privacy Protection 
 Consumer Protection 
 The MIIT set forth various requirements for consumer protection in a notice, issued on April 15, 2004, which addresses certain problems in the telecommunications sector, including ambiguity in billing practices for premium services, poor quality of connections and unsolicited SMS messages, all of which impinge upon the rights of consumers. 
 This trend was continued with the issuance of the Notice Regarding the Ratification and Administration of Mobile Information Services Fees and Charges Method by the MIIT on September 8, 2006. 
 On January 26, 2014, the SAIC issued the Administrative Measures on Online Transactions (the Online Transaction Measures), which took effect on March 15, 2014, to regulate online commodity trading and related online services and replace the previous Interim Measures for the Administration of Online Commodities Trading and Relevant Services issued on May 31, 2010. The Online Transaction Measures stipulate various obligations of online service providers, including the obligation to protect the interests of customers. Under the Online Transaction Measures, commodities or relevant services transacted online must comply with relevant laws, regulations and rules. When selling commodities or providing services to consumers, online commodity operators must comply with all applicable laws with respect to the protection of consumer rights/interests, intellectual property rights of others and the prevention of unfair competition. Information on commodities or services provided by online commodity operators or related service operators must be authentic and accurate. 
 On May 26, 2016, the MIIT issued the Measures on the Complaint Settlement of the Telecommunication Services Users (the Complaint Settlement Measures), which took effect on July 30, 2016. The Complaint Settlement Measures require telecommunication services providers to respond to their users within fifteen days upon the receipt of any complaint delivered by such users, the failure of which will give the complaining users the right to file a complaint against the service providers with the provincial branch offices of the MIIT. 
 We are aware of the increasingly strict legal environment covering consumer protection in China, and we strive to adopt all measures necessary to ensure that our business complies with these evolving standards. 
 Privacy Protection 
 The PRC Constitution states that PRC law protects the freedom and privacy of the communications of citizens and prohibits infringement of such rights. In recent years, PRC government authorities have issued various regulations on the use of the Internet that are designed to protect personal information from unauthorized disclosure. For example, the ICP Measures prohibit an Internet information services provider from insulting or slandering a third party or infringing upon the lawful rights and interests of a third party. In addition, PRC regulations authorize PRC telecommunication authorities to demand rectification of unauthorized disclosure by ICPs. 
 Chinese law does not prohibit ICPs from collecting and analyzing personal information from their users. The PRC government, however, has the power and authority to order ICPs to submit personal information of an Internet user if such user posts any prohibited content or engages in illegal activities on the Internet. In addition, the Several Provisions stipulate that ICPs must not, without the users consent, collect information on users that can be used, alone or in combination with other information, to identify the user, or User Personal Information, and may not provide any User Personal Information to third parties without prior user consent. ICPs may only collect User Personal Information necessary to provide their services and must expressly inform the users of the method, content and purpose of the collection and processing of such User Personal Information. In addition, an ICP may use User Personal Information only for the stated purposes under the ICPs scope of services. ICPs are also required to ensure the proper security of User Personal Information, and take immediate remedial measures if User Personal Information is suspected to have been disclosed. If the consequences of any such disclosure are expected to be serious, the ICP must immediately report the incident to the telecommunications regulatory authorities and cooperate with the authorities in their investigations. We require our users to accept a user agreement whereby they agree to provide certain personal information to us. If we violate these regulations, the MIIT or its local bureaus may impose penalties and we may be liable for damage caused to our users. 
 
37 
 
On December 28, 2012, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress enacted the Decision to Enhance the Protection of Network Information (Information Protection Decision), to further enhance the protection of User Personal Information in electronic form. The Information Protection Decision provides that ICPs must expressly inform their users of the purpose, manner and scope of the ICPs collection and use of User Personal Information, publish the ICPs standards for their collection and use of User Personal Information, and collect and use User Personal Information only with the consent of the users and only within the scope of such consent. The Information Protection Decision also mandates that ICPs and their employees must keep strictly confidential User Personal Information that they collect, and that ICPs must take such technical and other measures as are necessary to safeguard the information against disclosure. 
 On July 16, 2013, the MIIT issued the Order for the Protection of Telecommunication and Internet User Personal Information (the Order). Most of the requirements under the Order that are relevant to ICP operators are consistent with the requirements already established under the MIIT provisions discussed above, except that under the Order the requirements are often more strict and have a wider scope. If an ICP operator wishes to collect or use personal information, it may do so only if such collection is necessary for the services it provides. Further, it must disclose to its users the purpose, method and scope of any such collection or use, and must obtain consent from the users whose information is being collected or used. ICP operators are also required to establish and publish their protocols relating to personal information collection or use, keep any collected information strictly confidential, and take technological and other measures to maintain the security of such information. ICP operators are required to cease any collection or use of the user personal information, and de-register the relevant user account, when a given user stops using the relevant Internet service. ICP operators are further prohibited from divulging, distorting or destroying any such personal information, or selling or providing such information unlawfully to other parties. In addition, if an ICP operator appoints an agent to undertake any marketing or technical services that involve the collection or use of personal information, the ICP operator is still required to supervise and manage the protection of the information. The Order states, in broad terms, that violators may face warnings, fines, and disclosure to the public and, in the most severe cases, criminal liability. 
 On August 21, 2014, the supreme peoples court promulgated the Provisions of the Supreme Peoples Court on Application of Laws to Cases Involving Civil Disputes over Infringement upon Personal Rights and Interests by Using Information Networks, pursuant to which if an ICP operator discloses genetic information, medical records, health examination data, criminal record, home address, private events and or other personal information of a natural person online, causing damage to the person, the Peoples Court should support a claim by the infringed party for recovery of damages from the infringing ICP operator. 
 On January 5, 2015, the SAIC promulgated the Measures on Punishment for Infringement of Consumer Rights, pursuant to which business operators collecting and using personal information of consumers must comply with the principles of legitimacy, propriety and necessity, specify the purpose, method and scope of collection and use of the information, and obtain the consent of the consumers whose personal information is to be collected. Business operators may not: (i) collect or use personal information of consumers without their consent; (ii) unlawfully divulge, sell or provide personal information of consumers to others; (iii) send commercial information to consumers without their consent or request, or when a consumer has explicitly declined to receive such information. 
 On August 29, 2015, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress issued Amendment (IX) to the Criminal Law of the Peoples Republic of China (Amendment (IX)), which strengthens the protection of individual information and Internet security. Pursuant to Amendment (IX), network service providers who do not comply with laws and regulations regarding the safe management of information on their networks, and who do not correct their conduct after they receive notice of such non-compliance from the relevant regulatory authorities, may be sentenced to prison for up to three years, and may also be subject to public surveillance and fines. 
 On May 8, 2017, the Supreme Peoples Court of the PRC and the Supreme Peoples Procurator of the PRC issued the Interpretation of the Supreme Peoples Court and the Supreme Peoples Procurator on Several Issues Concerning the Applicable Law for Criminal Cases With Respect to Infringement of Citizens Personal Information, which defines personal information, the provision of personal information, and the illegal collection of personal information. 
 Our current security measures and those of the third parties with whom we transact business may not be adequate for the protection of user personal information. In addition, we do not have control over the security measures of our third-party online payment vendors. Security breaches of our system and the online payment systems that we use could expose us to litigation and liability for failing to secure confidential customer information and could harm our reputation, ability to attract customers and ability to encourage customers to purchase virtual items.

 | The Decision of the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress Regarding the Safeguarding of Internet Security (2000)which has been amended in 2009.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These pieces of legislation specifically prohibit the use of Internet infrastructure where it results in a breach of public security, the provision of socially destabilizing content or the divulgence of State secrets, as follows: 
 

 | A breach of public security includes a breach of national security or disclosure of state secrets; infringement on state, social or collective interests or the legal rights and interests of citizens or illegal or criminal activities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Socially destabilizing content includes any action that incites defiance or violation of Chinese laws; incites subversion of state power and the overturning of the socialist system; fabricates or distorts the truth, spreads rumors or disrupts social order; advocates cult activities; spreads feudal superstition; involves obscenities, pornography, gambling, violence, murder, or horrific acts; or instigates criminal acts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | State secrets are defined as matters that affect the security and interest of the state. The term covers such broad areas as national defense, diplomatic affairs, policy decisions on state affairs, national economic and social development, political parties and other State secrets that the State Secrecy Bureau has determined should be safeguarded.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the aforementioned legislation, it is mandatory for Internet companies in the PRC to complete security filing procedures with the local public security bureau and for them provide regular updates to the local public security bureau regarding information security and censorship systems for their Websites. In this regard, on October 1, 2004, the Administrative Rules on the Filing of Commercial Websites (Commercial Websites Filing Rules) were promulgated by the Beijing Administration of Industry and Commerce (Beijing AIC),to replace the Detailed Implementing Rules for the Measures for the Administration of Commercial Website Filings for the Record promulgated by the Beijing AIC on September 1, 2000. The Commercial Websites Filing Rules state that operators of commercial Websites must comply with the following requirements: 
 

 | filing with the Beijing AIC and obtain electronic registration marks for the Websites;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | placing the registration marks on the Websites homepages; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | registering the Website names with the Beijing AIC.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 On November 7, 2016, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress issued the Internet Security Law (the Internet Security Law), which took effect on June 1, 2017. The Internet Security Law requires providers of services over Internet networks to keep user information that they have collected in strict confidence and to establish improved systems for the protection of user information. Such service providers must provide notice of the purpose, methods and scope of their collection and use of user information, and obtain the consent of each person whose personal information will be collected. Providers of services over Internet networks may not collect any personal information that is not related to the services they provide, or disclose or tamper with personal information that they have collected, unless such information is encoded to prevent identification of individuals whose information is so disclosed or tampered with. Service providers who do not comply with the Internet Security Law may be subject to fines, suspension of their businesses, shutdown of their websites, and revocation of their business licenses. 
 
39 
 
Sohu Internet and Changyou have successfully registered the Sohu.com Website, the Changyou.com Website and the cy.com Website with the Beijing AIC and the electronic registration marks for the Websites are prominently placed on the homepages of the Sohu.com Website and the Changyou.com Website and the cy.com Website. Sogou Information has successfully registered the sogou.com Website with the Beijing AIC. 
 In addition, the State Security Bureau has issued regulations authorizing the blocking of access to any site it deems to be leaking State secrets or failing to comply with legislation regarding the protection of State secrets in the distribution of information online. Specifically, Internet companies in China with message boards, chat rooms or similar services, such as Sohu, must apply for the approval of the State Secrets Bureau prior to operating such services. 
 Accordingly, we have established an internal security committee and adopted security maintenance measures, employed a full-time supervisor and exchanged information on a regular basis with the local public security bureau with regard to sensitive or censored information and Websites. 
 Internet Content and Anti-Pornography 
 The PRC government has promulgated measures relating to Internet content through a number of government authorities, including the MIIT, the MOC, the SAPPRFT and the MPS. These measures specifically prohibit certain Internet activities, including the operation of online games, which results in the publication of any content which is found to, among other things, propagate obscenity, gambling or violence, instigate crimes, undermine public morality or the cultural traditions of the PRC, or compromise State security or secrets. If an ICP license holder violates these measures, the PRC government may revoke its ICP license and shut down its Websites. 
 In addition, the PRC government has issued several regulations concerning the installation of filter software to filter out unhealthy and vulgar content from the Internet. In April 1, 2009, the Ministry of Education, the MIIT and certain other PRC ministries and agencies issued a notice requiring that, by the end of May 2009, all computer terminals connected with the Internet at all elementary and secondary schools be able to include and operate Green Dam-Youth Escort, which is software aimed at filtering out unhealthy and vulgar content in text and graphics from the Internet and which, according to the Website for the software, may be used to control time spent on the Internet, prohibit access to computer games, and filter out unhealthy Websites. The MIIT further expanded the scope of required use of this filter software by issuing a notice on May 19, 2009 requiring that, effective as of July 1, 2009, all computers manufactured and sold in China have the latest available version of Green Dam-Youth Escort preinstalled when they leave the factory and that all imported computers have the latest available version of Green Dam-Youth Escort preinstalled before being sold in China. Green-Dam Youth Escort is to be preinstalled on the hard drive of the computer or in the form of a CD accompanying the computer and is also to be included in the backup partition and system restore CD. However, on June 30, 2009, the MIIT postponed the implementation of this requirement regarding pre-installation of Green Dam-Youth Escort. 
 On December 4, 2009, the MIIT and three other PRC government authorities jointly issued the Incentives Measures for Report of Pornographic, Obscene and Vulgar Messages on Internet and Mobile Media (Anti-Pornography Notice), to crack down on online pornography. Pursuant to the Anti-Pornography Notice, rewards of up to RMB10,000 will be provided to Internet users who report Websites that feature pornography, and a committee has been established to review such reports to determine an appropriate award. During a PRC anti-pornography campaign, which continued during 2014, many Websites (including mobile Websites) that contained pornography were closed down. In addition, China Mobile announced a temporary suspension of billing for Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) services, as a means of fighting against Websites providing pornographic content. 
 On April 13, 2014, the National Working Group on Anti-Pornography and three other PRC government authorities jointly issued the Proclamation of Special Action Regarding Crackdown on Online Pornographic Content (the Anti-Pornography Proclamation). Under the Anti-Pornography Proclamation, Internet service providers must immediately remove texts, images, video, advertisements and other information that contain pornographic content. The relevant government authority may order enterprises or individuals who flagrantly produce or disseminate pornographic content to stop conducting business, and may revoke relevant administrative permits. Moreover, an enterprise or individual who provides telecom operation services, network access services, advertising services or payment services to facilitate dissemination of pornographic content may have criminal or civil penalties imposed under the PRC Criminal Law and other relevant laws and regulations.

Laws and Regulations Related to Unfair Competition 
 Pursuant to an amendment of the Unfair Competition Law of the PRC, or the Unfair Competition Law, adopted by the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress on November 4, 2017 and effective January 1, 2018, a business operator is prohibited from taking any of the following actions:

 The Unfair Competition Law forbids business operators to pay bribes in order to gain an opportunity or competitive advantage in a business transaction. 
 The Unfair Competition Law also stipulates that, without the consent of the affected party, the operator of an Internet business operator may not insert links into the products and services of another Internet business operator in order to re-direct user traffic; may not mislead or compel users to modify, terminate, or un-install any Internet products or services of another Internet business operator; and may not take actions in bad faith to cause an Internet product or service of another Internet business operator to be unusable by users of the other business operators properties. 
 The amendment of the Unfair Competition Law that became effective January 1, 2018 increases the maximum amount of administrative penalties that may be imposed for violations. 
 In addition, the Supreme Peoples Court has promulgated an Interpretation on Several Issues Relating to the Application of the Law in Civil Trials for Unfair Competition Cases, which became effective as of February 1, 2007. This interpretation provides guidance on how to conduct trials involving unfair competition, protect the legal rights and interests of business operators, and maintain orderly market competition. 
 Regulation of M&A and Overseas Listings 
 On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the MOFCOM, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation (SAT), the SAIC, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the CSRC), and the SAFE, jointly issued the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (M&A Rule), which became effective on September 8, 2006 and amended on June 22, 2009. The M&A Rule includes provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle formed for purposes of the overseas listing of equity interests in PRC companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicles securities on an overseas stock exchange. 
 On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official Website procedures regarding its approval of overseas listings by special purpose vehicles. The CSRC approval procedures require the filing of a number of documents with the CSRC. The application of this PRC regulation remains unclear, with no consensus currently existing among leading PRC law firms regarding the scope of the applicability of the CSRC approval requirement. 
 The M&A Rules also establish procedures and requirements that could make some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a Chinese domestic enterprise. 
 In February 2011, the General Office of the State Council promulgated a Notice on Establishing the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (Circular 6), which established a security review system for mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors. Under Circular 6, a security review is required for mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors having national defense and security concerns and mergers and acquisitions by which foreign investors may acquire de facto control of domestic enterprises with national security concerns. In August 2011, the MOFCOM promulgated the Rules on Implementation of Security Review System (MOFCOM Security Review Rules), to replace the Interim Provisions of the Ministry of Commerce on Matters Relating to the Implementation of the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors promulgated by the MOFCOM in March 2011. The MOFCOM Security Review Rules, which came into effect on September 1, 2011, provide that the MOFCOM will look into the substance and actual impact of a transaction and prohibit foreign investors from bypassing the security review requirement by structuring transactions through proxies, trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements or offshore transactions.

Laws and Regulations Related to Antitrust 
 On August 30, 2007, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress of the PRC adopted the PRC Anti-Monopoly Law (AML), which took effect on August 1, 2008. Pursuant to the AML, monopolistic conduct, including entering into monopoly agreements, abuse of dominant market position and concentration of undertakings that have the effect of eliminating or restricting competition, is prohibited. To further implement the Antitrust Law and clarify certain issues, the State Council, MOFCOM, NDRC and SAIC, issued several regulations and rules, including the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior Notification of Concentrations of Undertakings issued by the State Council on August 3, 2008, the Regulation on the Prohibition of Acts Involving Monopolistic Agreements issued by the SAIC on December 31, 2010, the Regulation on the Prohibition of Conduct Constituting an Abuse of a Dominant Market Position issued by the SAIC on December 31, 2010, the Regulation on the Prevention of Conduct Constituting an Abuse of Administrative Powers to Eliminate or Restrict Competition issued by the SAIC on December 31, 2010, the Anti-Price Monopoly Regulation issued by the NDRC on 29 December 2010, the Declaration Rules for Concentrations of Undertakings issued by the MOFCOM on November 21, 2009, and amended on June 6, 2014, the Assessment Rules for Concentration of Undertakings issued by the MOFCOM on November 24, 2009, and the Provisional Measures on the Investigation and Handling of Concentrations between Business Operators which Were Not Notified in Accordance with the Law issued by the MOFCOM on December 30, 2011. 
 Taken together these various laws and regulations provide for the following: 
 Monopoly Agreement: competing business operators may not enter into monopoly agreements that eliminate or restrict competition, such as by boycotting transactions, fixing or changing the price of commodities, limiting the output of commodities, fixing the price of commodities for resale to third parties, unless such agreements satisfy the exemptions under the Antitrust Law, such as improving technologies or increasing the efficiency and competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises. Sanctions for violations include an order to cease the relevant activities, confiscation of illegal gains and fines (from 1% to 10% of sales revenue from the previous year, or RMB 500,000 if the intended monopoly agreement has not been performed). 
 Abuse of Dominant Market Position: a business operator with a dominant market position may not abuse its dominant market position to conduct acts such as selling commodities at unfairly high prices or buying commodities at unfairly low prices, selling products at prices below cost without any justifiable cause, and refusing to trade with a trading party without any justifiable cause. Dominant market position refers to a market position held by a business operator having the capacity to control the price, quantity or other trading conditions of commodities in the relevant market, or to hinder or affect any other business operator to enter the relevant market, which will be determined based on the market share of the relevant business operator, capacity of a business operator to control the sales market, the degree of dependence of other business operators upon the business operator in question in transactions, and the degree of difficulty for other business operators to enter into the relevant market. Sanctions for violation of the prohibition on the abuse of dominant market position include an order to cease the relevant activities, confiscation of illegal gains and fines (from 1% to 10% of sales revenue from the previous year). 
 Concentration of Enterprises: pursuant to the AML, where a concentration of enterprises reaches the declaration threshold stipulated by the State Council, a declaration must be lodged in advance with the antitrust authority under the State Council. Otherwise, the concentration cannot be effected. Concentration refers to (1) a merger of enterprises; (2) acquiring control over other enterprises by an enterprise through acquiring equities or assets; or (3) acquiring control over, or the possibility of exercising decisive influence on, an enterprise by contract or by any other means. Under the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior Notification of Concentrations of Undertakings, the thresholds for prior notification of concentration of enterprises are the following: 

 | the combined worldwide turnover of all of the subject enterprises in the preceding financial year is more than RMB10.00 billion, and the nationwide turnover within China of each of at least two of the subject enterprises in the preceding financial year is more than RMB400.0 million; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the combined nationwide turnover within China of all the subject enterprises in the preceding financial year is more than RMB2.00 billion, and the nationwide turnover within China of each of at least two of the subject enterprises in the preceding financial year is more than RMB400.0 million.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If business operators fail to comply with these mandatory declaration provisions, the antitrust authority is empowered to terminate and/or unwind the transaction, dispose of relevant assets, shares or businesses and impose fines up to RMB500,000.

Regulation of Foreign Currency Exchange and Dividend Distribution 
 The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations (FX Regulations), which were last amended in August 2008. Under the FX Regulations, the RMB is freely convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China, unless the prior approval of the SAFE is obtained and prior registration with the SAFE is made. Dividends paid by a PRC subsidiary to its overseas shareholder are deemed income of the shareholder and are taxable in the PRC. Pursuant to the Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC may purchase or remit foreign currency, subject to a cap approved by the SAFE, for settlement of current account transactions without the approval of the SAFE. Foreign currency transactions under the capital account are still subject to limitations and require approvals from, or registration with, the SAFE and other relevant PRC governmental authorities. 
 In July 2014, the SAFE promulgated the Circular on Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration Over the Overseas Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment by Domestic Residents Via Special Purpose Vehicles (Circular 37) which replaced Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents Corporate Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles (Circular 75).Circular 37 requires PRC residents, including PRC institutions and individuals, to register with the local SAFE branch in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, referred to in Circular 37 as a special purpose vehicle, for the purpose of holding domestic or offshore assets or interests. PRC residents must also file amendments to their registrations in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. Under these regulations, PRC residents failure to comply with specified registration procedures may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant PRC entity, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent, as well as restrictions on capital inflows from the offshore entity to the PRC entity, including restrictions on the ability to contribute additional capital to the PRC entity. Further, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange regulations. 
 Under Circular 37, if a non-listed special purpose vehicle uses its own equity to grant equity incentives to any directors, supervisors, senior management or any other employees directly employed by a domestic enterprise which is directly or indirectly controlled by such special purpose vehicle, or with which such an employee has established an employment relationship, related PRC residents and individuals may, prior to exercising their rights, apply to the SAFE for foreign exchange registration formalities for such special purpose vehicle. However, in practice, different local SAFE branches may have different views and procedures on the interpretation and implementation of the SAFE regulations, and since Circular 37 was the first regulation to regulate the foreign exchange registration of a non-listed special purpose vehicles equity incentives granted to PRC residents, there remains uncertainty with respect to its implementation. 
 On December 25, 2006, the PBOC issued the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control and related Implementation Rules were issued by the SAFE on January 5, 2007. Both became effective on February 1, 2007. Under these regulations, all foreign exchange transactions involving an employee share incentive plan, share option plan, or similar plan participated in by onshore individuals may be conducted only with approval from the SAFE or its authorized branch. Under the Notice of Issues Related to the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Listed Company (Offshore Share Incentives Rules), which was issued by the SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC citizens who are granted share options, restricted share units or restricted shares by an overseas publicly listed company are required to register with the SAFE or its authorized branch and to comply with a series of other requirements. In November 2011, the SAFE approved our application to designate our PRC subsidiary Sohu Media to handle the registrations and other procedures required by the Offshore Share Incentives Rules. In February 2012, the SAFE approved Changyous application to designate its PRC subsidiary AmazGame to handle the registrations and other procedures required by the Offshore Share Incentive Rules. If we, Changyou or the PRC employees of Changyou and us who hold options, restricted share units or restricted shares fail to comply with these registration or other procedural requirements, we, Changyou and/or such employees may be subject to fines and other legal sanctions. Sogou has applied for registration of its 2017 Share Incentive Plan with the SAFE, and Sogou is in the process of applying for such registration of its 2010 Share Incentive Plan. If its 2017 Share Incentive Plan and 2010 Share Incentive Plan are not accepted for registration by the SAFE, Sogou may not be able to grant further share-based awards to its PRC employees, Sogou and those who have received awards may be subject to fines and legal sanctions, and Sogous ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries and its PRC subsidiaries ability to distribute dividends to it may be limited.

The principal regulations governing distribution of dividends of foreign holding companies include the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (1986), which was amended in October 2000 and October, 2016, and the Administrative Rules under the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (2001), which was amended in February, 2014. 
 Under these regulations, foreign investment enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, foreign investment enterprises in China are required to allocate at least 10% of their accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds unless these reserves have reached 50% of the registered capital of the enterprises. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. Furthermore, under the Corporate Income Tax Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008 and was amended on February 24, 2017, the maximum tax rate for the withholding tax imposed on dividend payments from PRC foreign invested companies to their overseas investors that are not regarded as resident for tax purposes is 20%. The rate was reduced to 10% under the Implementing Regulations for the PRC Corporate Income Tax Law issued by the State Council. However, a lower withholding tax rate of 5% might be applied if there is a tax treaty between China and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding companies, such as is the case with Hong Kong, and certain requirements specified by PRC tax authorities are satisfied. 
 Laws and Regulations Related to Employment and Labor Protection 
 On June 29, 2007, the National Peoples Congress promulgated the Employment Contract Law of PRC (Employment Contract Law), which became effective as of January 1, 2008 and amended on December 28, 2012. The Employment Contract Law requires employers to provide written contracts to their employees, restricts the use of temporary workers and aims to give employees long-term job security. 
 Pursuant to the Employment Contract Law, employment contracts lawfully concluded prior to the implementation of the Employment Contract Law and continuing as of the date of its implementation shall continue to be performed. Where an employment relationship was established prior to the implementation of the Employment Contract Law but no written employment contract was concluded, a contract must be concluded within one month after its implementation. 
 On September 18, 2008, the State Council promulgated the Implementing Regulations for the PRC Employment Contract Law which came into effect immediately. These regulations interpret and supplement the provisions of the Employment Contract Law.
We have modified our standard employment contract to comply with the requirements of the Employment Contract Law and its implementing regulations. We have entered into written employment contracts with all of our employees. 
 Conclusion 
 In the opinion of Haiwen, our principal PRC Subsidiaries and principal VIEs are approved to engage in the specific online services (categorized and addressed in the above sections) as described in the respective scopes indicated in the corresponding licenses and/or permits issued to the respective companies. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS 
 We regard our patents, copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely on patent, trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, non-competition and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. Before we launch any new products or services, we generally apply for registration of related patents, trademarks, and software copyrights. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization. Furthermore, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving. The laws of the PRC and certain other countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. 
 We have been issued 848 patents in China and 25 patents in countries and regions outside of China covering inventions, utility models, and designs; we have 1,164 patent applications currently pending in China and 93 patent applications currently pending in countries and regions outside of China; we have submitted 59 international patent applications through the procedures under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT; and we intend to apply for more patents to protect our core technologies and intellectual property.

We have registered three service marks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, consisting of Sohu.com, registered on August 1, 2000; Sohu.com (stylized), registered on August 1, 2000; and Sohu, registered on June 13, 2000. We have registered 3,833 trademarks with the Trademark Office of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce in China, including the mark SOHU.com, and such marks relating to our products as Sohu.com logos, Sohu Fox logos, GoodFeel logos, Go2Map, Sogou logos, Sohu Focus, TLBB, ChangYou.com, cyou.com, TL logos, Blade Online, 17173 and their corresponding Chinese version marks; and we are in the process of applying for the registration of 895 other trademarks. In addition, we are in the process of applying for recognition of certain of our marks as famous Beijing trademarks and well-known Chinese trademarks. We also filed registration of trademarks relating to our subsidiary companies names and Changyous online games and other businesses in various countries and regions, such as the United States, European Union, Turkey, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Brazil, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Our rights to these marks could be affected adversely if any of our applications are rejected. In addition, it is possible that our competitors will adopt product or service names similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to distinguish our brand and possibly leading to customer confusion. 
 We are the registered owner of 718 software copyrights in China, each of which we have registered with the State Copyright Bureau of China and its local branches. 
 We own the rights to 482 domain names that we use in connection with the operation of our business, including the Sohu, Sogou, and Changyou websites. 
 Many parties are actively developing chat, search, Web directory and related Web technologies. We expect these parties to continue to take steps to protect these technologies, including seeking patent protection. There may be patents issued or pending that are held by others and cover significant parts of our technology, business methods or services. For example, we are aware that a number of patents have been issued in the areas of e-commerce, Web-based information indexing and retrieval and online direct marketing. Disputes over rights to these technologies may arise in the future. We cannot be certain that our products do not or will not infringe valid patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims, from time to time, relating to the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of our business. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 We also intend to continue licensing technology from third parties. The market is evolving and we may need to license additional technologies to remain competitive. We may not be able to license these technologies on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may fail to successfully integrate any licensed technology into our services. Our inability to obtain any of these licenses could delay product and service development until alternative technologies can be identified, licensed and integrated. 
 TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE 
 The Sohu Group has built what we believe is a reliable and secure network infrastructure, that will fully support our operations. We have professional technical support teams to maintain our current technology infrastructure and online operating platform, as well as develop new software features to further enhance the functionality of our management and security systems. We monitor the operation of our server network 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Our remote control system allows us to track our concurrent online users in real time, and discover and fix hardware or software problems on our server network in a timely fashion. 
 Content and Services provided by Sohu 
 As of December 31, 2017, Sohu maintained approximately 17,000 servers in China. To fully support the operation of Sohus content and services, Sohu established these data centers primarily through China Mobile, China United Network Communication Group Company Limited (China Unicom), and China Telecom Corporation (China Telecom), which are the three largest Internet connection service providers in China, to support most of Sohus core services. In addition, Sohu has established branch nodes in different provinces throughout China through different telecommunication operators in order to establish national coverage and provide fast and stable access to Sohus Internet platforms properties to users across China. In addition, Sohu has developed cooperation with several smaller private Internet service providers. 
 Sohu has developed close working relationships with China Mobile, China Unicom, China Telecom and smaller-size telecommunication operators. Sohus operations depend on the ability of China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom to protect Sohus systems against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins and other events. These telecommunication operators provide Sohu with support services twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week. They also provide connectivity for Sohus servers through multiple high-speed connections. All facilities are protected by Uninterruptible Power Supplies. 
 
45 
 
For reliability, availability, and serviceability, Sohu has created an environment in which each server can function independently. Key components of Sohus server architecture are served by multiple redundant machines. Sohu also uses in-house and third-party monitoring software. Sohus reporting and tracking systems generate daily traffic, demographic and advertising reports. Sohu deploys load balance equipment and cloud computing to avoid single point failure. 
 Sohus operations must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver frequently updated information. Components or features of Sohus products and services have in the past suffered outages or experienced slower response times because of equipment or software down time. These events have not had a material adverse effect on Sohus business to date, but such events could have a material adverse effect in the future. 
 Content and Services provided by Sogou 
 As of December 31, 2017, Sogou owned approximately 31,000 servers located in seven Internet data centers in China. Sogou has also obtained what it believes is a sufficient amount of connectivity bandwidth to meet the current and anticipated needs of its operations, and has established a large-scale GPU service cluster to provide computing power for its AI technologies. 
 Online Games provided by Changyou 
 Changyou supports its operations with a network of reliable and secure physical and cloud-based servers that have fully supported its operations for many years. As of December 31, 2017, Changyou maintained for its online game business approximately 5,000 physical servers that are located in Internet data centers in 14 major cities in China, and 3,000 cloud-based servers that are spread across mainland China, Hong Kong and North America. In order to enhance Changyous game players experience and to improve connectivity, Changyou has located its physical game servers in a number of regions throughout China. This allows its players to connect to the nearest servers that are located in their region without exchanging data across the national backbone network. Furthermore, to ensure high quality services for its game players, Changyou works with leading domestic cloud technology firms to provide efficient and stable game services using cloud-based resources. 
 EMPLOYEES 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 9,300 employees, including 4,100 employees for Sohu, 2,700 employees for Sogou, and 2,500 employees for Changyou. We also employ independent contractors to support our research and development, sales, marketing, and editorial departments. None of our personnel are represented under collective bargaining agreements. 
 We have entered into standard employment agreements with our employees through our subsidiaries and VIEs. All of our employees have entered into confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation agreements with us. However, the degree of protection afforded to an employer pursuant to confidentiality and non-competition undertakings governed by PRC law may be more limited when compared to the degree of protection afforded under the laws of other jurisdictions. A number of our employees hold share-based awards granted by Sohu, Sogou, Changyou, and Sohu Video, which provide additional financial incentives to them. Most of these awards vest over a period of four years.
