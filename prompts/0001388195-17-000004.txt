Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 
Formed in 2006, PharMerica Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, the "Corporation," "we," "us," or "our"), a Delaware Corporation, is an institutional pharmacy services company that services healthcare facilities, provides pharmacy management services to hospitals, provides specialty infusion services to patients outside a hospital setting, and offers the only national oncology pharmacy in the United States. The Corporation is the second largest institutional pharmacy services company in the United States based on revenues and customer licensed beds under contract, operating 99 institutional pharmacies, 19 specialty infusion centers and 4 specialty oncology pharmacies in 45 states. The Corporation's customers are typically institutional healthcare providers, such as skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, hospitals, individuals receiving in-home care and patients with cancer.
Institutional Pharmacy Business
 
Our core business provides pharmacy products and services to residents and patients in skilled nursing facilities, nursing centers, assisted living facilities, hospitals, and other long-term alternative care settings. We purchase, repackage, and dispense prescription and non-prescription pharmaceuticals in accordance with physician orders and deliver such medication to healthcare facilities for administration to individual patients and residents. Depending on the specific location, we service healthcare facilities typically within a radius of 120 miles or less of our pharmacy locations at least once each day. We provide 24-hour, seven-day per week on-call pharmacist services for emergency dispensing, delivery, and/or consultation with the facility's staff or the resident's attending physician. We also provide various supplemental healthcare services that complement our institutional pharmacy services.
 
We offer prescription and non-prescription pharmaceuticals to our customers through unit dose or modified unit dose packaging, dispensing, and delivery systems, typically in a 14 to 30 day supply. Unit dose medications are packaged for dispensing in individual doses as compared to bulk packaging used by most retail pharmacies. The customers we serve prefer the unit dose delivery system over the bulk delivery system employed by retail pharmacies because it improves control over the storage and ordering of drugs and reduces errors in drug administration in healthcare facilities. Nursing staff in our customers' facilities administer the pharmaceuticals to individual patients and residents. The Corporation also utilizes an on-site dispensing system, with real time data transfer between the system and the Corporation, which provides timely medication administration in emergency and first dose situations. We also offer clinical pharmacy programs that encompass a wide range of drug therapy and disease management protocols, including protocols for anemia treatment, infectious diseases, wound care, nutritional support, renal dosing, and therapeutic substitution.
 
Our computerized dispensing and delivery systems are designed to improve efficiency and control over distribution of medications to patients and residents. We provide computerized physician orders and medication administration records for patients or residents on a monthly basis as requested. Data from these records are formulated into monthly management reports on patient and resident care and quality assurance. This system improves efficiencies in nursing time, reduces drug waste, and helps to improve patient outcomes.
 
Hospital Pharmacy Management Services
 
We also provide hospital pharmacy management services. These services generally entail the overall management of the hospital pharmacy operations, including the ordering, receipt, storage, and dispensing of pharmaceuticals to the hospital's patients pursuant to the clinical guidelines established by the hospital. We offer the hospitals a wide range of regulatory and financial management services, including inventory control, budgetary analysis, staffing optimization, and assistance with obtaining and maintaining applicable regulatory licenses, certifications, and accreditations. We work with the hospitals to develop and implement pharmacy policies and procedures, including drug formulary development and utilization management. We also offer clinical pharmacy programs that encompass a wide range of drug therapy and disease management protocols, including protocols for anemia treatment, infectious diseases, wound care, nutritional support, renal dosing, and therapeutic substitution. The hospital pharmacy management services business is comprised of hospital customers, of which, our largest service is to the majority of the Kindred Healthcare Inc. ("Kindred") hospitals.
Consultant Pharmacist Services
 
Federal and state regulations mandate that long-term care facilities, in addition to providing a source of pharmaceuticals, retain consultant pharmacist services to monitor and report on prescription drug therapy in order to maintain and improve the quality of resident care. On September 30, 2008, the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General ("OIG") published OIG Supplemental Compliance Program Guidance for Nursing Homes. With quality of care being the first risk area identified, the supplemental guidance is part of a series of government efforts focused on improving quality of care at skilled nursing and long-term care facilities. The guidance contains compliance recommendations and an expanded discussion of risk areas. The guidance stressed that facilities must provide pharmaceutical services to meet the needs of each resident and should be mindful of potential quality of care problems when implementing policies and procedures on proper medication management. It further stated that facilities can reduce risk by educating staff on medication management and improper pharmacy kickbacks for consultant pharmacists and that facilities should review the total compensation paid to consultant pharmacists to ensure it is not structured in a way that reflects the volume or value of particular drugs prescribed or administered to residents.
 
We provide consultant pharmacist services to approximately 66% of our patients serviced. The services offered by our consultant pharmacists include:
 
 
• | Monthly reviews of each resident's drug regimen to assess the appropriateness and efficiency of drug therapies, including the review of medical records, monitoring drug interactions with other drugs or food, monitoring laboratory test results, and recommending alternative therapies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Participation on quality assurance and other committees of our customers, as required or requested by such customers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monitoring and reporting on facility-wide drug utilization;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Development and maintenance of pharmaceutical policy and procedure manuals; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Assistance with federal and state regulatory compliance pertaining to resident care.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Medical Records
 
The Corporation provides medical records services, which includes the completion and maintenance of medical record information for patients in the Corporation's customer's facilities. The medical records services include:

• | Real-time access to medication and treatment administration records, physician order sheets and psychotropic drug monitoring sheets;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Online ordering to save time and resources;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | A customized database with the medication profiles of each resident's medication safety, efficiency and regulatory compliance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Web-based individual patient records detailing each prescribed medicine; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Electronic medical records to improve information to make it more legible and instantaneous.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Specialty Infusion Services
 
The Corporation provides specialty infusion services focused on providing complex pharmaceutical products and clinical services to patients in client facilities, hospice, and outside of hospital or nursing home settings. We offer high-touch clinical services to patients with acute or chronic conditions. The delivery of specialty infusion therapy requires comprehensive planning and monitoring which is provided through our registered nursing staff. Our nursing staff performs an initial patient assessment, provides therapy specific training and education, administers therapy and monitors for potential side effects. We also provide extensive clinical monitoring and patient follow-up to ensure patient therapy adherence and proactively manage patients' conditions. An in-network strategy facilitates easier decision-making for referral sources and provides us with the ability to pre-authorize patients, auto adjudicate, and bill electronically, enabling faster prescription turnaround.
Specialty Oncology Pharmacy
 
We provide dispensing of oncology drugs, care management and other related services to patients, oncology practices, and hospitals.  These services encompass clinical coordination and review, compliance with appropriate oncology protocols, patient assistance with outside funding, and timely delivery of medication.  We coordinate the administration of medications to the physician's office or directly to the patient at the appropriate point of treatment.  We work directly with the payers to bill insurance companies for the medication provided, ensuring all prior authorizations and approvals are obtained.  These services offer physicians an alternative to the traditional buy-and-bill distribution model, allowing them to outsource drug procurement, inventory management, and prescription administration.
Our Business Focus
 
Drive Scale Economies. We focus on consistently providing quality pharmaceutical services to our customers at competitive prices and delivery of prescriptions in a timely and effective manner. Our business seeks to implement innovative and cost-effective solutions to improve the provision of medication to our customers and the residents and patients that they serve.
Focus on Organic Growth through New Sales and Client Retention. We aim to grow our business through expansion in our existing markets and by servicing new customers. We believe our industry has underlying market growth potential attributable to both an increase in drug utilization as well as the general aging population of the United States.
Acquire Competitors. We also intend to expand our market share through selected geographic expansion in markets not currently served by us and through strategic acquisitions in existing and underserved markets. The Corporation currently operates in 45 states. We believe that there are growth opportunities in several other markets. There are numerous businesses in our markets, mostly small or regional companies that lack the scale that we believe will be necessary to ultimately compete in a market that is national in scope. We intend to actively seek opportunities to acquire companies. Since its formation in 2006, the Corporation has acquired 23 institutional pharmacy businesses, six specialty infusion services businesses, one specialty oncology pharmacy and one hospital services business.
Sales and Marketing
 
We sell our products and services through a national sales force. The sales force is organized by both geographic lines and size of client. We believe this helps us to maximize coverage, manage costs, and align more effectively with our operating regions. Our sales representatives specialize in the products and services we offer and the markets in which we operate. Their knowledge permits us to meet the unique needs of our customers while maintaining profitable relationships.
Customers
 
Institutional Care Settings. At December 31, 2016, the Corporation provided institutional pharmacy services to patients in 45 states.  Our customers are typically institutional healthcare providers, such as skilled nursing facilities, nursing centers, assisted living facilities and other long-term alternative care settings. We are generally the primary source of pharmaceuticals for our customers.
 
Our customers depend on institutional pharmacies like us to provide the necessary pharmacy products and services and to play an integral role in monitoring patient medication regimens and safety. We dispense pharmaceuticals in patient specific packaging in accordance with physician instructions.
 
Specialty Infusion Services. At December 31, 2016, the Corporation provided specialty infusion services to patients in 16 states with acute or chronic conditions in a setting outside of a hospital or nursing home.
Specialty Oncology Services.  At December 31, 2016, the Corporation provided specialty oncology medication services to patients in 46 states with acute and chronic conditions in a hospital or physician practice or the home setting.

Suppliers/Inventory
 
We obtain pharmaceutical and other products from Cardinal Health ("Cardinal Health") and other contracts negotiated directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers for discounted prices.  The Corporation entered into a Prime Vendor Agreement with Cardinal effective April 1, 2015 ("Cardinal Health PVA").  The initial term of the agreement is through June 30, 2018 and contains one year automatic renewal provisions.  The Cardinal Health PVA requires the Corporation to purchase certain levels of brand and non-injectable generic drugs from Cardinal Health.  The Cardinal Health PVA does provide flexibility for the Corporation to contract with other suppliers.  Under the agreement, the Corporation is entitled to certain rebates based on drug purchases.  The loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable or if available are significantly more expensive.
 
We seek to maintain an on-site inventory of pharmaceuticals and supplies to ensure prompt delivery to our customers.  Cardinal Health maintains local distribution facilities in most major geographic markets in which we operate.  In addition, we supply many of our pharmacies with select products from a distribution center operated by a third-party logistics company.
 
Brand to Generic Conversions
 
The following table summarizes the Corporation's generic drug dispensing rate:
 

2014 | 2015 | 2016 
------+-------+------
84.9% | 86.0% | 86.0%

 
The following table summarizes the material brand-to-generic conversions expected to occur in 2017 through 2020:
 

2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+--------------+-----
Azilect( Q1) | Sensipar (Q1)* | Ranexa (Q1)* | ** 
Vytorin (Q2) | Invanz (Q1) | Lyrica (Q2)* | 
Reyataz (Q4) | | | 
Advair (Q3)* | | | 
ProAir (Q2) | | | 
Strattera (Q2) | | | 
* These represent the most significant brand-to-generic conversions 
** There are no significant brand-to-generic conversions currently known
(Number in parentheses refers to the expected quarter of conversion) 

 
When a branded drug shifts to a generic, initial pricing of the generic drug in the market will vary depending on the number of manufacturers launching their generic version of the drug. Historically, a shift from brand-to-generic decreased our revenue and improved our gross margin from sales of these classes of drugs during the initial time period that a brand drug has a generic alternative. Third-party payers may reduce their reimbursements to the Corporation after the initial period. In addition, the number of generic manufacturers entering the market impacts the overall cost and reimbursement of generic drugs. This acceleration in the reimbursement reduction and the number of generic manufacturers generally result in margin compression. Due to the unique nature of the brand-to-generic conversion, management cannot estimate the future financial impact of the brand-to-generic conversions on the Corporation's results of operations.
 
Supplier and Manufacturer Rebates
 
We currently receive rebates from certain manufacturers and distributors of pharmaceutical products for achieving targets of market share or purchase volumes. Rebates are designed to prefer, protect, or maintain a manufacturer's products that are dispensed by the pharmacy under its formulary. Rebates for brand name products are generally based upon achieving a defined market share tier within a therapeutic class and can be based on either purchasing volumes or actual prescriptions dispensed. Rebates for generic products are more likely to be based on achieving purchasing volume requirements.
Information Technology
 
Computerized medical records and documentation are an integral part of our distribution system. We primarily utilize a proprietary information technology infrastructure that automates order entry of medications, dispensing of medications, invoicing, and payment processing. These systems provide consulting drug review, electronic medication management, medical records, and regulatory compliance information to help ensure patient safety. These systems also support verification of eligibility and electronic billing capabilities for the Corporation's pharmacies. They also provide order entry, shipment, billing, reimbursement and collection of service fees for medications, specialty services and other services rendered.
 
Based upon our electronic records, we are able to provide reports to our customers and management on patient care and quality assurance. These reports help to improve efficiency in patient care, reduce drug waste, and improve patient outcomes. We expect to continue to invest in technologies that help critical information access and system availability.

Sources of Pharmacy Revenues
 
We receive payment for our services from third party payers, including Medicare Part D Plans, government reimbursement programs under Medicare and Medicaid, and non-government sources such as institutional healthcare providers, commercial insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, private payers, and contracted providers. The sources and amounts of our revenues will be determined by a number of factors, including the mix of our customers' patients, brand to generic conversions and the rates and changes of reimbursement among payers. Changes in our customers' censuses, the case mix of the patients, brand and generic dispensing rates, and the payer mix among private pay, Medicare Part D, institutional healthcare providers, and Medicaid, will affect our profitability.
 
A summary of revenue by payer type for the years ended December 31, are as follows (dollars in millions):
 

 | 2014 | | 2015 | | 2016 
-----------------------------------+--------+---------+---------------+-------+-------
 | Amount | | % of Revenues | | Amount | | % of Revenues | Amount | | | % of Revenues | 
Medicare Part D | $ | 866.0 | | 45.7 | % | $ | 951.3 | | 46.9 | % | | $ | 990.6 | 47.4 | %
Institutional healthcare providers | | 459.7 | | 24.3 | | | 469.8 | | 23.2 | | | | 448.4 | 21.4 | 
Medicaid | | 167.1 | | 8.8 | | | 150.1 | | 7.4 | | | | 132.9 | 6.4 | 
Private and other | | 81.9 | | 4.3 | | | 79.4 | | 3.9 | | | | 71.5 | 3.4 |

Competition
 
We face a highly competitive environment in the institutional pharmacy market. In each geographic market, there are national, regional and local institutional pharmacies that provide services comparable to those offered by our pharmacies. Also one of our competitors has greater financial resources than we do which may be more established in the markets they serve than we are. In addition, owners of skilled nursing facilities are also entering the institutional pharmacy market, particularly in areas of their geographic concentration. On a nationwide basis, there is one larger competitor in the institutional pharmacy industry, Omnicare, Inc., a division of CVS Health (NYSE: CVS).
 
We believe that the competitive factors most important to our business are pricing, quality and the range of services offered, clinical expertise, ease of doing business with the provider and the ability to develop and maintain relationships with customers. Because relatively few barriers to entry exist in the local markets we serve, we have encountered and will continue to encounter substantial competition from local market entrants.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
We use a number of trademarks and service marks. All of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the United States or are the subject of pending applications for registration.
 
We have various proprietary products, processes, software and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers. We generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret, patent and copyright laws and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections.
 
Although we believe that our products and processes do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties, third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time.
 
Seasonality
 
Our largest customers in institutional pharmacy services are skilled nursing facilities. Both prescription and non-prescription drug sales at skilled nursing facilities are affected by the timing and severity of the cold/flu season and other seasonality of the long-term care facilities industry, however seasonality does not have a material effect on the Corporation's consolidated financial results.
Working Capital
 
For information about the Corporation's practices relating to working capital items, see Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources".
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 5,700 employees which included approximately 1,200 part-time employees. The Corporation had approximately 300 employees that were covered by collective bargaining agreements as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 1,200 licensed pharmacists. We believe that our relationships with our employees are good.

Government Regulation
 
General
 
Extensive federal, state and local regulations govern institutional pharmacies and the healthcare facilities that they serve. These regulations cover licenses, staffing qualifications, conduct of operations, reimbursement, record keeping and documentation requirements and the confidentiality and security of health-related information. Our institutional pharmacies are also subject to federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements between healthcare providers, including the federal anti-kickback statutes and the federal physician self-referral laws.
Licensure, Certification and Regulation
 
States generally require that the state board of pharmacy license a pharmacy operating within the state. Many states also regulate out-of-state pharmacies that deliver prescription products to patients or residents in their states. We have the necessary pharmacy state licenses, or pending applications, for each pharmacy we operate. Our pharmacies are also registered with the appropriate federal and state authorities pursuant to statutes governing the regulation of controlled substances. In addition, pharmacists, nurses and other healthcare professionals who provide services on our behalf are in most cases required to obtain and maintain professional licenses and are subject to state regulation regarding professional standards of conduct.
 
The Drug Enforcement Agency (the "DEA"), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"), and various state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceutical products and controlled substances. These laws impose a host of requirements on the pharmaceutical supply channel, including providers of institutional pharmacy services. Under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, as a dispenser of controlled substances, we must register with the DEA, file reports of inventories and transactions and provide adequate security measures. In addition, we are required to comply with all the relevant requirements of the Controlled Substances Act for the transfer and shipment of pharmaceuticals. The FDA, DEA, and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We have received all necessary regulatory approvals and believe that our pharmacy operations are in substantial compliance with applicable federal and state good manufacturing practice requirements.
 
Client long-term care facilities are separately required to be licensed in the states in which they operate and, if serving Medicaid or Medicare patients, must be certified to be in compliance with applicable program participation requirements. Client facilities are also subject to the nursing home reforms of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, as amended, which imposed strict compliance standards relating to quality of care for facility operations, including vastly increased documentation and reporting requirements.
 
On October 4, 2016, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a Final Rule revising the requirements for long-term care facilities participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The revised rules comprehensively impact the operation of long-term care facilities. Among them are requirements specific to pharmacy services within long-term care facilities, which directly impact our business. The revised rule requires a pharmacist to review a resident's medical chart during each monthly drug regimen review. Additionally, the pharmacist must report any irregularities, including use of unnecessary drugs, to the attending physician, the facility medical director, and the nursing director.  Moreover, the revised rules expanded existing requirements that facilities ensure efforts are made to reduce or eliminate the inappropriate use of psychotropic drugs.
 The Final Rule became effective on November 28, 2016 and provides for implementation to occur in three phases, with the first phase having required compliance by November 28, 2016 and the last phase requiring implementation by November 28, 2019.
 
Laws Affecting Referrals and Business Practices
 
We are subject to federal and state laws that govern financial and other arrangements between healthcare providers. These laws prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between healthcare providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, a particular provider for medical products and services. These laws include:

• | the federal "anti-kickback" statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly or willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration "including any kickback, bribe or rebate" directly or indirectly in return for or to induce the referral of an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal "Stark laws" which prohibit, with limited exceptions, the referral of patients by physicians for certain designated health services, to an entity with which the physician has a financial relationship.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



These laws impact the relationships that we may have with potential referral sources. We have a variety of relationships with potential referral sources, including hospitals and skilled nursing facilities with which we have contracted to provide pharmacy services. With respect to the anti-kickback statute, the OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution.
  7
 

While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, none of which is material to us, may not qualify for safe harbor protection. Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti-kickback statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. In addition, as a means of providing guidance to healthcare providers, the OIG issues a variety of sub-regulatory guidance including Special Fraud Alerts, Special Advisory Bulletins, Advisory Opinions, and other compliance guidance documents. This guidance does not have the force of law, but identifies features of arrangements or transactions that may indicate that the arrangements or transactions violate the anti-kickback statute or other federal health care laws. While we believe our practices comply with the anti-kickback statute, we cannot assure our practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti-kickback statute.
 
In addition to federal law, many states have enacted similar statutes that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by federal healthcare programs. Violations of these laws may result in fines, imprisonment, denial of payment for services and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other state-funded programs.
 
Similarly to how the OIG enacts safe harbors and other guidance with respect to the anti-kickback statute, CMS enacts new exceptions and guidance with respect to the federal Stark law. As explained above, the Stark law prohibits the referral of patients by physicians for certain designated health services to an entity ("DHS Entity") with which the physician has a financial relationship. The scope of what constitutes a "financial relationship" is broad under the law, although certain ownership/investment interests and compensation arrangements between DHS Entities and physicians are excepted by statutes and regulations. CMS continues to release new regulations (including new exceptions), Advisory Opinions, and other compliance documents to provide guidance to healthcare providers. Moreover, many states have also enacted similar statutes governing the relationship between health care entities and referring physicians, which may be broader or narrower than the federal Stark laws.
 Other provisions in the Social Security Act and in other federal and state laws authorize the imposition of penalties, including criminal and civil fines and exclusions from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs for false claims, improper billing and other offenses. These laws include the federal False Claims Act, under which private parties have the right to bring "qui tam" whistleblower lawsuits against companies that submit false claims for payments to the government. Recent changes to the False Claims Act, expanding liability to certain additional parties and circumstances, may make these qui tam law lawsuits more prevalent. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims laws.
 
In addition, a number of states have undertaken enforcement actions against pharmaceutical manufacturers involving pharmaceutical marketing programs, including looking at relationships with pharmacies and programs containing incentives for pharmacists to dispense one particular product rather than another. These enforcement actions arose under various state laws including fraud and abuse laws and consumer protection laws which generally prohibit false advertising and deceptive trade practices.
 
In the ordinary course of business, we are regularly and currently subject to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee applicable healthcare program participation and payment regulations. We believe that the regulatory environment surrounding most segments of the healthcare industry remains intense. Federal and state governments continue to impose intensive enforcement policies resulting in a significant number of inspections, citations for regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions including demands for refund of overpayments, terminations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, bars on Medicare and Medicaid payments and fines. Such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and liquidity.
 
We believe our contract arrangements with other healthcare providers and our pharmaceutical suppliers and our pharmacy practices are in substantial compliance with applicable federal and state laws. These laws may, however, be interpreted in the future in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation and application.
 
Laws Affecting Interactions with Patients / Beneficiaries
 Federal laws also impact how health care entities may interact with patients. The federal civil monetary penalty statute ("CMP") prohibits offering or providing remuneration to Medicare and state health care program beneficiaries that the person providing the remuneration knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiaries to order or receive health care items or services from a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of health care items or services. Much like the federal anti-kickback statute, the OIG promulgates regulations that affect the scope of this prohibition.
 For example, on December 7, 2016, the OIG released amendments to the CMP. Some of the amendments may impact our business, such as allowing certain remuneration that poses a low risk of harm and promotes access to care for patients, as well as allowing certain remuneration to financially needy individuals. This law, as well as similar state laws, impact how we may interact with patients and thus the operation of our business.
 
State Laws Affecting Access to Services
 
Some states have enacted "freedom of choice" or "any willing provider" requirements as part of their state Medicaid programs or in separate legislation. These laws may preclude a nursing center from requiring their patients and residents to purchase pharmacy or other ancillary medical services or supplies from particular providers that have a supplier relationship with the nursing center. Limitations such as these may increase the competition which we face in providing services to nursing center residents.
HIPAA
 
The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, commonly known as "HIPAA," mandates the adoption of regulations aimed at standardizing transaction formats and billing codes for documenting medical services, dealing with claims submissions and protecting the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA regulations that standardize transactions and code sets require standard formatting for healthcare providers, like us, that submit claims electronically.
 
The HIPAA privacy regulations apply to "protected health information," or "PHI," which is defined generally as individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained in any form or medium, excluding certain education records and student medical records. The privacy regulations seek to limit the use and disclosure of most paper and oral communications, as well as those in electronic form, regarding an individual's past, present or future physical or mental health or condition, or relating to the provision of healthcare to the individual or payment for that healthcare, if the individual can or may be identified by such information. HIPAA provides for the imposition of civil or criminal penalties if PHI is improperly disclosed.
  8
 

HIPAA's security regulations require us to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic protected health information that we create, receive, maintain or transmit. We must protect against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security of such information and the unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
 
In addition to HIPAA, we are subject to state privacy laws and other state privacy or health information requirements not preempted by HIPAA, including those which may furnish greater privacy protection for individuals than HIPAA.
 
The scope of our operations involving health information is broad and the nature of those operations is complex. Although we believe that our contract arrangements with healthcare payers and providers and our business practices are in compliance with applicable federal and state electronic transmissions, privacy and security of health information laws, the requirements of these laws, including HIPAA, are complicated and are subject to interpretation. In addition, state regulation of matters also covered by HIPAA, especially the privacy standards, is increasing, and determining which state laws are preempted by HIPAA is a matter of interpretation. Failure to comply with HIPAA or similar state laws could subject us to loss of customers, denial of the right to conduct business, civil damages, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions.
 
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"), part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, changed several aspects of HIPAA including, without limitation, the following: (i) applies HIPAA security provisions and penalties directly to business associates of covered entities; (ii) requires certain notifications in the event of a security breach involving PHI; (iii) restricts certain unauthorized disclosures; (iv) changes the treatment of certain marketing activities; and (v) strengthens enforcement activities. In addition, the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services issued an interim final rule on August 24, 2009 that requires notifications for certain unpermitted disclosures of PHI. The final rule was issued on January 17, 2013.
 
2010 Health Care Reform Legislation
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the reconciliation law known as Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (combined we refer to both Acts as the "2010 Health Care Reform Legislation") were enacted in March 2010. State participation in the expansion of Medicaid under the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation is voluntary. Two key provisions of the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation that are relevant to the Corporation are: (i) the gradual modification to the calculation of the Federal Upper Limit ("FUL") for drug prices and the definition of Average Manufacturer's Price ("AMP") and (ii) short cycle dispensing.
 
It is not clear what impact, if any, the 2016 elections (including the new Presidential administration) will have on the various provisions of the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. It is possible that parts of the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation that impact our business may be repealed or otherwise amended. We will continue to monitor any developments that may impact our business.
 FUL and AMP Changes
 
The reimbursement rates for pharmacy services under Medicaid are determined on a state-by-state basis subject to review by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") and applicable federal law.  Although Medicaid programs vary from state to state, they generally provide for the payment of certain pharmacy services, up to the established limits, at rates determined in accordance with each state's regulations.  Federal regulations and the regulations of certain states establish "upper limits" for reimbursement of certain prescription drugs under Medicaid (these upper limits being the "FUL").
 
The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation amended the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (the "DRA") to change the definition of the FUL by requiring the calculation of the FUL as no less than 175% of the weighted average, based on utilization, of the most recently reported monthly AMP for pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent multi-source drugs available through retail community pharmacies nationally.
 
In addition, the definition of AMP changed to reflect net sales only to drug wholesalers that distribute to retail community pharmacies and to retail community pharmacies that directly purchase from drug manufacturers. Further, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation continues the current statutory exclusion of prompt pay discounts offered to wholesalers and adds three other exclusions to the AMP definition: (i) bona fide services fees;(ii) reimbursement for unsalable returned goods (recalled, expired, damaged, etc.); and (iii) payments from and rebates/discounts to certain entities not conducting business as a wholesaler or retail community pharmacy.

On February 1, 2016, CMS released a Final Rule titled Medicaid Program; Covered Outpatient Drugs. This Final Rule details the types of sales that are to be included and excluded in determining AMP. Moreover, consistent with the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation, the Final Rule calculates the FULs at 175% of the weighted average, determined based on the basis of utilization, of the most recently reported monthly AMP. As an exception, however, if the AMP-based FUL is lower than the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost ("NADAC"), the FULs will be set at the drug's NADAC. This Final Rule became effective on April 1, 2016.
 
CMS published the draft FULs in accordance with the Final Rule for two months before publishing the final FULs. The final FULs became effective April 1, 2016 to coincide with the effective date of the Final Rule. States had until May 1, 2016 to implement the FULs. CMS updates the FULs on a monthly basis and the FULs become effective on the first date of the month following their publication. States have 30 days after the effective date of the monthly updates to implement the new FULs.
 
The Final Rule also changed how states reimburse pharmacies. The Final Rule now requires states to pay pharmacies based on the actual acquisition cost of the drug, as opposed to the estimated acquisition cost. Moreover, the Final Rule requires states to consider the sufficiency of both the ingredient cost reimbursement and dispensing fee reimbursement when proposing changes to either of these components of reimbursement for Medicaid covered drugs.
 
Due to the nature of our contracts, the Final Rule has not had a material impact on our business; however, the Corporation will continue to analyze the effect of these changes on its business, results of operations, and liquidity.
 
Short Cycle Dispensing and Dispensing Fees
 
Pursuant to the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation, Prescription Drug Plans ("PDPs") are required, under Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans ("Medicare Advantage" or "MAPDs") to utilize specific, uniform dispensing techniques, such as weekly, daily, or automated dose dispensing, when dispensing covered Medicare Part D drugs to beneficiaries who reside in a long-term care facility to reduce waste associated with 30 to 90 day prescriptions for such beneficiaries. Pursuant to CMS issued regulation, beginning January 1, 2013, pharmacies dispensing to long-term care facilities must dispense no more than 14-day supplies of brand-name oral solid medications covered by Medicare Part D.
Medicare Part D Changes
 
In a May 23, 2014 Final Rule titled "Medicare Program: Contract Year 2015 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs," CMS announced the Part D Prescriber Enrollment Requirement, which states that Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit plans may not cover drugs prescribed by providers who are not enrolled in (or validly opted out of) Medicare in an approved status, except in very limited circumstances. CMS previously stated that it is delaying enforcement of the Part D Enrollment Requirements until February 1, 2017. On November 6, 2016, however, CMS announced that it will implement the new requirement in a multifaceted, phased approach, where full enforcement of the requirement will begin on January 1, 2019.
 
In a February 12, 2015 Final Rule entitled "Medicare Program: Contract Year 2016 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs," CMS finalized a regulation, effective January 1, 2016, prohibiting financial arrangements that penalize more efficient long-term care dispensing techniques (e.g., dispensing a 3 day supply over a 14 day supply) through pro-rated dispensing fees based on a day's supply or quantity dispensed. CMS also finalized a requirement that, effective January 1, 2016, any differences in payment methodologies among long-term care pharmacies incentivize more efficient dispensing techniques. The Corporation has implemented these regulations in its operations and as amended its contracts with the Part D Plans so that there has been no material impact to the business, results of operations, or liquidity.
 
CIA and DEA MOA
 
In May 2015, the Corporation entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement ("CIA") with United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General ("OIG") and a Memorandum of Agreement ("MOA") with the Drug Enforcement Agency ("DEA") concurrent with the execution of settlement agreements with the OIG and the DEA settling alleged Controlled Substance Act ("CSA") violations and associated False Claims Act allegations.
 
The CIA requires the Corporation, among other things to : (i) create procedures designed to ensure it complies with the CSA and related regulations, (ii) retain an independent review organization to review the Corporation's compliance with the terms of the CIA and report to the OIG regarding that compliance; and (iii) provide training for certain Corporation employees as to the Corporation's requirements under the CSA.  If the Corporation fails to comply with the terms of the CIA, it may be required to pay certain monetary penalties.  Furthermore, if the Corporation commits a material breach of the CIA, the OIG may exclude the Corporation from participating in federal healthcare programs.  Any such exclusion would result in the revocation or termination of contracts and/or licenses and potentially have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.
 
The MOA requires the Corporation to comply with all requirements of the CSA, specifically relating to the dispensing of scheduled prescription drugs.  If the Corporation fails to comply with the terms of the MOA, the DEA may suspend a Corporation's pharmacy DEA Certificate of Registration and begin an administrative hearing process pursuant to 21 U.S.C. Section 824.  Any such suspension would prohibit the Corporation's pharmacy from dispensing scheduled prescription drugs and would lead to the revocation or termination of contracts and/or licenses and potentially have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.
 
21st Century Cures Act
 
The 21st Century Cures Act ("Cures Act"), enacted in December 2016, among other things implemented Average Sales Price ("ASP") pricing for Part B DME infusion drugs in January of 2017 and delayed payment for the home infusion services necessary to administer these drugs until January of 2021. The amount at which the services will be reimbursed has not yet been determined by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. While several therapies are impacted by this change, the two most affected therapies of our specialty home infusion business are inotropic therapy for heart failure and subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy for primary immunodeficiency diseases. Because of the delayed implementation of the reimbursement for home infusion therapy services and the unknowns with respect to the actual amount of reimbursement, the Corporation cannot determine the full impact of the Cures Act on the Corporation.  The change in presidential administrations has caused uncertainty regarding the implementation of the Cures Act, meaning that the full impact of this new law on the Company is uncertain. The Corporation will continue to analyze the effect of this law on its business and results of operations.

Overview of Reimbursement
 
Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over and to certain disabled persons. Medicaid is a medical assistance program administered by each state that provides healthcare benefits to certain indigent patients. Within the Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework, there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings, interpretations, and discretion that may affect payments made under Medicare and Medicaid.
 
We receive payment for our services from institutional healthcare providers, commercial Medicare Part D Plans, third party payer government reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and other non-government sources such as commercial insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, and contracted providers. With respect to our skilled nursing facilities customers, their residents are covered by Medicare Part A, Part B and Part D Plans, Medicaid, insurance, and other private payers (including managed care).
 
Medicare
 
The Medicare program consists of four parts: (i) Medicare Part A, which covers, among other things, in-patient hospital, skilled nursing facilities, home healthcare, and certain other types of healthcare services; (ii) Medicare Part B, which covers physicians' services, outpatient services, and certain items and services provided by medical suppliers such as intravenous therapy; (iii) Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage, a managed care option for beneficiaries who are entitled to Medicare Part A and enrolled in Medicare Part B; and (iv) Medicare Part D, which provides coverage for prescription drugs that are not otherwise covered under Medicare Part A or Part B for those beneficiaries that enroll.
Part A
 
The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (the "BBA") mandated the Prospective Payment System ("PPS") for Medicare-eligible enrolled residents in skilled nursing facilities. Under PPS, Medicare pays skilled nursing facilities a fixed fee per patient per day for extended care services to patients, covering substantially all items and services furnished during such enrollee's stay. Such services and items include pharmacy services and prescription drugs. We bill skilled nursing facilities based upon a negotiated fee schedule and are paid based on those contractual relationships. We do not receive direct payment from Medicare for patients covered under the Medicare Part A benefit. We classify the revenues recognized from these payers as Institutional Healthcare Providers.
 
Federal legislation continues to focus on reducing Medicare and Medicaid program expenditures. Such decreases may directly impact the Corporation's customers and their Medicare reimbursement. Given the changing nature of these rules, we are unable at this time to fully evaluate the impact on our business. Any evaluation of budgeting, cost-cutting, and financing of health care must also consider the impact of legislation and the impact its proposed health care policies could have on any future cost considerations.
 
Part D
 
Medicare Part D provides coverage for prescription drugs that are not otherwise covered under Medicare Part A or Part B for those beneficiaries that enroll. Under Medicare Part D, beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private commercial insurers who contract with CMS (or in a "fallback" plan offered on behalf of the government through a contractor, to the extent private entities fail to offer a plan in a given area), which provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs (collectively, "Part D Plans"). Part D Plans include both plans providing the drug benefit on a standalone basis and Medicare Advantage plans providing drug coverage as a supplement to an existing medical benefit under that Medicare Advantage plan. Medicare beneficiaries generally have to pay a premium to enroll in a Part D Plan, with the premium amount varying from one Part D Plan to another, although CMS provides various federal subsidies to Part D Plans to reduce the cost to beneficiaries.
 
Part D Plans are required to make available certain drugs on their formularies. Dually-eligible residents in nursing centers generally are entitled to have their prescription drug costs covered by a Part D Plan, provided that the prescription drugs which they are taking are either on the Part D Plan's formulary or an exception to the Part D Plan's formulary is granted. CMS reviews the formularies of Part D Plans and requires these formularies to include the types of drugs most commonly used by Medicare beneficiaries. CMS also reviews the formulary exceptions criteria of the Part D Plans that provide for coverage of drugs determined by the Part D Plan to be medically appropriate for the enrollee; however there currently is not a separate formulary for long-term care residents.
 
We obtain reimbursement for drugs we provide to enrollees of the given Part D Plan in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated between us and the Part D Plan. The Medicare Part D final rule prohibits Part D plans from paying for drugs and services not specifically called for by the BBA.

Medicare Part D does not alter federal reimbursement for residents of nursing centers whose stay at the nursing center is covered under Medicare Part A. Accordingly, Medicare's fixed per diem payments to nursing centers under PPS will continue to include a portion attributable to the expected cost of drugs provided to such residents. We will, therefore, continue to receive reimbursement for drugs provided to such residents from the nursing center in accordance with the terms of our agreements with each nursing center.
 
In addition, we receive rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers for undertaking certain activities that the manufacturers believe may increase the likelihood that we will dispense their products. CMS continues to question whether institutional pharmacies should be permitted to receive these access/performance rebates from manufacturers with respect to prescriptions covered under Medicare Part D, but has not prohibited the receipt of such rebates. CMS defines these as rebates a manufacturer provides to long-term care pharmacies that are designed to "prefer, protect, or maintain" that manufacturer's product selection by the long-term care pharmacy or to increase the volume of that manufacturer's products that are dispensed by the pharmacy under its formulary. CMS, in 2007, required PDPs to have policies and systems in place as part of their drug utilization management programs to protect beneficiaries and reduce costs when long-term care pharmacies receive incentives to move market share through access/performance rebates. The elimination or substantial reduction of manufacturer rebates, if not offset by other reimbursement, would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Medicaid
 
The reimbursement rate for pharmacy services under Medicaid is determined on a state-by-state basis subject to review by CMS and applicable federal law. Although Medicaid programs vary from state to state, they generally provide for the payment of certain pharmacy services, up to established limits, at rates determined in accordance with each state's regulations. The federal Medicaid statute specifies a variety of requirements that a state plan must meet, including the requirements related to eligibility, coverage for services, payment, and admissions. For residents that are eligible for Medicaid only, and are not dual eligibles covered under Medicare Part D, we bill the individual state Medicaid program or in certain circumstances the state's designated managed care or other similar organizations. Federal regulations and the regulations of certain states establish "upper limits" for reimbursement of certain prescription drugs under Medicaid. In most states, pharmacy services are priced at the lower of "usual and customary" charges or cost, which generally is defined as a function of average wholesale price and may include a profit percentage plus a dispensing fee. Most states establish a fixed dispensing fee per prescription that is adjusted to reflect associated cost. Over the last several years, state Medicaid programs have lowered reimbursement through a variety of mechanisms, principally higher discounts off average wholesale price levels, expansion of the number of medications subject to federal upper limit pricing, and general reductions in contract payment methodology to pharmacies.
Environmental Matters
 
In operating our facilities, historically we have not encountered any material difficulties effecting compliance with applicable pollution control laws. No material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities are expected. While we cannot predict the effect which any future legislation, regulations or interpretations may have upon our operations, we do not anticipate any changes regarding pollution control laws that would have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.
