--------+---------

 Dicerna is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative subcutaneously delivered ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference (RNAi)-based pharmaceuticals using our GalXCTM RNAi platform for the treatment of diseases involving the liver, including rare diseases, viral infectious diseases, chronic liver diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Within these therapeutic areas, we believe our GalXC RNAi platform will allow us to build a broad pipeline of therapeutics with commercially attractive pharmaceutical properties, including a subcutaneous route of administration, infrequent dosing (e.g., dosing that is monthly or quarterly, and potentially even less frequent), high therapeutic index, and specificity to a single target gene. Our key development programs include DCR-PHXC for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria (PH), currently in a phase 1 clinical trial; and undisclosed product candidate against a serious rare liver disease, currently in IND/CTA-enabling studies; and DCR-HBVS for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV), currently in IND/CTA-enabling studies. 
 All of our GalXC drug discovery and development efforts are based on the therapeutic modality of RNAi, a highly potent and specific mechanism for silencing the activity of a targeted gene. In this naturally occurring biological process, double-stranded RNA molecules induce the enzymatic destruction of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) of a target gene that contains sequences that are complementary to one strand of the therapeutic double-stranded RNA molecule. The Companys GalXC RNAi platform utilizes a particular structure of double-stranded RNA molecules configured for subcutaneous delivery to the liver. Due to the enzymatic nature of RNAi, a single GalXC molecule incorporated into the RNAi machinery can destroy hundreds or thousands of mRNAs from the targeted gene. 
 The GalXC RNAi platform supports Dicernas long-term strategy to retain, subject to the evaluation of potential licensing opportunities as they may arise, a full or substantial ownership stake and to invest internally in diseases with focused patient populations, such as certain rare diseases. We see such diseases as representing opportunities that carry a relatively higher probability of success, with genetically and molecularly defined disease markers, high unmet need, a limited number of Centers of Excellence to facilitate reaching these patients, and the potential for more rapid clinical development programs. For more complex diseases with multiple gene dysfunctions and larger patient populations, we plan to pursue collaborations that can provide the enhanced scale, resources and commercial infrastructure required to maximize these prospects. Our collaborative research and license agreement with BI, entered into on October 27, 2017 (the BI Agreement) and pursuant to which the Company and BI jointly research and develop product candidates for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) using our GalXC platform, is an example of such a collaboration. 
 Development Programs 
 In choosing which development programs to advance, we apply scientific, clinical, and commercial criteria that we believe allow us to best leverage our GalXC RNAi platform and maximize value. The Company is focusing its efforts on three priority therapeutic programs that currently have a CTA filed or are in IND/CTA enabling studies and on a series of programs in the clinical candidate selection stage that may be elevated into IND/CTA enabling studies in the future, either on our own or in collaboration with larger pharmaceutical companies. 
 Our three priority programs are: DCR-PHXC for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria (PH); a program for an undisclosed rare disease; and DCR-HBVS for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Our programs in clinical candidate selection include multiple programs targeting undisclosed targets in rare diseases, chronic liver diseases, and cardiovascular diseases including a program for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, for which as a provisional clinical candidate, DCR-PCSK9, has already been selected. In October 2017, we filed a CTA for our lead GalXC product candidate, DCR-PHXC, with the Medicines and 
 
5 


  Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom (UK), and in December 2017, we dosed the first human in the Phase 1 DCR-PHXC clinical trial. We expect to file additional CTAs and/or INDs for our programs in 2018 and 2019. 
 The table below sets forth the state of development of our various GalXC RNAi platform product candidates as of March 7, 2018. 
 
Our current GalXC RNAi platform development programs are as follows: 
 

 | Primary Hyperoxaluria. We are developing DCR-PHXC for the treatment of all types of PH. PH is a family of rare inborn errors of metabolism in which the liver produces excessive levels of oxalate, which in turn causes damage to the kidneys and to other tissues in the body. Patients often endure frequent painful kidney stone events often requiring surgical intervention, and in many cases patients with PH progress to end stage renal disease. Standard of care for these patients includes intensive dialysis, and combined liver and kidney transplants. In preclinical models of PH, DCR-PHXC reduces oxalate production to near-normal levels, ameliorating the disease condition. Based on evaluation of genome sequence databases, there may be as many as 16,000 people with PH in the US and major European countries.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On October 16, 2017, we announced that we had submitted a CTA for DCR-PHXC to the MHRA in the UK. On December 7, 2017, we announced that we dosed the first human in a Phase 1 trial of DCR-PHXC. The Phase 1 trial for DCR-PHXC, called PHYOX, is a single ascending-dose study of DCR-PHXC in normal healthy volunteers (NHV) and patients with PH. The study is divided into two groups: Group A is a placebo-controlled, single-blind, single center Phase 1 study, enrolling up to 25 NHVs; Group B is an open-label, multi-center study enrolling up to 16 patients with PH types 1 (PH1) and 2 (PH2). The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single doses of DCR-PHXC in both groups. Secondary objectives are to characterize the pharmacokinetics of single doses of DCR-PHXC in NHVs and patients with PH, and to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of single doses of DCR-PHXC on biochemical markers including, but not limited to, changes in urine oxalate concentrations. Patients with PH will be dosed after safety has been established at the same dose level in normal healthy volunteers. We plan to dose the first patient in Group B in the second quarter of 2018 and expect to have clinical proof-of-concept (POC) data in the second half of 2018. We have submitted CTAs in Germany, France and the Netherlands. Additionally, 
 
6 


  we expect to initiate a multi-dose Phase 2/3 study in the first quarter of 2019, pending positive POC data and regulatory approvals. 
 On July 15, 2017, in a series of presentations at the 12th International Workshop on Primary Hyperoxaluria for Professionals, Patients and Families in Tenerife, Spain (12th International Workshop), we presented new preclinical data suggesting the potential utility of DCR-PHXC for treating all forms of PH. In particular, we presented research from animal models demonstrating how DCR-PHXC inhibits the lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) gene, which we have identified as potentially being an optimal therapeutic target in patients with PH. LDHA inhibition was shown in animal models to reduce oxalate to normal or near-normal levels in PH types 1, 2 and ethylene glycol-induced hyperoxaluria (a model for idiopathic PH). 
 LDHA reduction has a near-linear correlation with oxalate reduction and offers a minimal metabolic intervention. These benefits of LDHA inhibition may translate into consistent therapeutic activity even in the event of a missed dose. There are numerous case reports of LDHA deficiency naturally occurring in humans, with no reported adverse effects due to deficiency in the liver. 
 To facilitate DCR-PHXC development, we have completed our Primary HYperoxaluria Observational Study (PHYOS), an international, multicenter, observational study in patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of PH1. PHYOS collected data on key biochemical parameters implicated in the pathogenesis of PH1. We are using the data to better understand the baseline PH1 disease state, which will help guide long-term drug development plans. At the 12th International Workshop, we reported interim data from the studys 20 enrolled patients with a median age at screening of 21 years (range 12-61 years). The patients had been diagnosed at a median age of 7 years (range 1-59 years), and 14 patients (74%) had a medical history of renal stones. Over the six-month observation period, the variability (coefficient of variation) between 24-hour urine measurements of oxalate at different time points was 28%. Our clinical team is using these data to design clinical studies using 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion as a surrogate marker for clinical benefit. We expect to publish data from PHYOS in 2018. 
 

 | An undisclosed rare disease involving the liver. We are developing a GalXC-based therapeutic, targeting a liver-expressed gene involved in a serious rare disease. For competitive reasons, we have not yet publicly disclosed the target gene or disease. We have selected this target gene and disease based on criteria that include having a strong therapeutic hypothesis, a readily-identifiable patient population, the availability of a potentially predictive biomarker, high unmet medical need, favorable competitive positioning and what we believe is a rapid projected path to approval. The disease is a genetic disorder, where mutations in the disease gene lead to the production of an abnormal protein. The protein causes progressive liver damage and fibrosis, in some cases leading to cirrhosis and liver failure, and we believe that silencing of the disease gene will prevent production of the abnormal protein and thereby slow or stop progression of the liver fibrosis. Greater than 100,000 people in the United States (U.S.) are believed to be homozygous (i.e. having identical pairs of genes for any given pair of hereditary characteristics) for the mutation that causes the liver disease, and at least 20% of those people, and potentially a significantly higher fraction, are believed to have liver-associated disease as a consequence. We plan to seek a risk-sharing collaborator for this program before we file an IND and/or CTA, which we expect to be prepared to file in the second quarter of 2018.

 | Chronic Hepatitis B Virus infection. We have declared a GalXC RNAi platform-based product candidate for the treatment of HBV, DCR-HBVS, and are conducting formal non-clinical development studies. We expect to file an IND and/or a CTA during the fourth quarter of 2018. According to the World Health Organization, over 250 million people are currently living with chronic HBV infection worldwide, resulting in nearly a million deaths annually. Current therapies for HBV rarely lead to a long-term immunological cure as measured by the clearance of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and sustained HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) suppression in patient plasma or blood. DCR-HBVS targets HBV messenger RNA, and leads to greater than 99% reduction in circulated HBsAg in mouse

models of HBV infection. Based on these preclinical studies, and only if we receive appropriate regulatory approval to begin human clinical trials, we hope to determine the potential of DCR-HBVS to reduce HBsAg and HBV DNA levels in the blood of HBV patients in a subcutaneous dosing paradigm.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Hypercholesterolemia (PCSK9 targeted therapy). We are using our GalXC RNAi platform to develop a therapeutic that targets the PCSK9 gene for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The Company has selected a provisional clinical candidate for the program, but is continuing to explore ways to further optimize the program, including exploring more advanced versions of our GalXC platform with enhanced properties, while we assess the market potential of this program. PCSK9 is a validated target for hypercholesterolemia, and there are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies targeting PCSK9 that are based on monoclonal antibody technology. Based on preclinical studies, we believe that our GalXC RNAi platform has the potential to produce a PCSK9-targeted therapy with attractive commercial properties, such as small subcutaneous injection volumes and less frequent dosing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Additional pipeline programs. We have developed a robust portfolio of additional targets and diseases that we plan to pursue either on our own or in collaboration with partners. We have applied our GalXC technology to multiple gene targets across our disease focus areas of rare diseases, chronic liver diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Pursuant to our strategy, we are seeking collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies to advance our programs in the areas of chronic liver diseases and cardiovascular diseases. Both these disease areas represent large and diverse patient populations, requiring complex clinical development and commercialization paths that we believe can be more effectively pursued in collaboration with larger pharmaceutical companies. For our additional rare diseases, we are continuing to assess their potential for clinical success and market opportunity while optimizing our GalXC molecules. For our additional pipeline programs (including PCSK9), we may utilize more advanced versions of our GalXC technology, that further improve pharmaceutical properties of the GalXC molecules, including enhancing the duration of action and potency. Improvements to our GalXC compound include modification of the tetraloop end of the molecule, which can be applied to any target gene and program, resulting in a substantially longer duration of action in animal models across multiple targets. Modification of the tetraloop only impacts the passenger strand and does not involve any modification to the guide strand. These modifications are unique to our GalXC platform and, we believe, provide a competitive advantage for the Company.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the GalXC development programs outlined above, on October 27, 2017, we entered into the BI Agreement, pursuant to which the Company and BI jointly research and develop product candidates for the treatment of chronic liver diseases, with an initial focus on NASH, using our GalXC platform. NASH is caused by the buildup of fat in the liver, potentially leading to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. NASH has an especially high prevalence among obese and diabetic patients, and is an area of high unmet medical need. The BI Agreement is for the development of product candidates against one target gene with an option for BI to add the development of product candidates that target a second gene. We are working exclusively with BI to develop the product candidates against the undisclosed target gene. We are responsible for the discovery and initial profiling of the product candidates, including primary pre-clinical studies, synthesis, and delivery. BI is responsible for evaluating and selecting the product candidates for further development. If BI selects one or more product candidates, it will be responsible for further pre-clinical development, clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of those products. Also pursuant to the BI Agreement, we granted BI a worldwide license in connection with the research and development of the product candidates and will transfer to BI intellectual property rights of the product candidates selected by BI for clinical development and commercialization. We also may provide assistance to BI in order to help BI further develop selected product candidates. Pursuant to the BI Agreement, BI agreed to pay us a non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million for the first target. During the term of the research program, BI will reimburse us the cost of materials and third-party expenses that have been included in the preclinical studies up to an agreed-upon limit. We are eligible to receive up to $191.0 million in potential development and commercial milestones related to the initial target. We are also eligible to receive 
 
8 


  royalty payments on potential global net sales, subject to certain adjustments, tiered from high single digits up to low double-digits. BIs option to add a second target would provide for an option fee payment and success-based development and commercialization milestones and royalty payments to us. 
 We are party to a collaboration for our early generation of non-GalXC Dicer Substrate RNAi technology against two targets, the KRAS oncogene and an additional undisclosed gene, with the global pharmaceutical company Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK), to use for development in oncology and formulated using KHKs proprietary drug delivery system. KHK has provided us with notice of termination related to the non-KRAS program. We also have developed a wholly owned clinical candidate, DCR-BCAT, targeting the ß-catenin oncogene. DCR-BCAT is based on an extended version of our earlier generation non-GalXC Dicer Substrate RNAi technology and is delivered by our lipid nanoparticle (LNP) tumor delivery system, EnCoreTM. We plan to out-license or spin out the DCR-BCAT opportunity, given our focus on our GalXC platform-based programs. 
 Strategy 
 We are committed to delivering transformative therapies based on our GalXC RNAi platform to patients with rare inherited diseases involving the liver and for other therapeutic areas involving the liver such as viral infectious diseases, chronic liver diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. We have qualified dozens of disease-associated genes in clinical indications where we believe an RNAi-based inhibitor may provide substantial benefit to patients, providing expansive therapeutic opportunities. 
 The key elements of our strategy are as follows. 
 

 | Create new programs in indication areas with high unmet medical need. We intend to continue to use our proprietary GalXC RNAi technology platform to create new, high value pharmaceutical programs. Our primary focus will remain: (1) rare inherited diseases involving genes in the liver; and (2) other therapeutic areas involving the expression of therapeutic gene targets in the liver such as viral infectious diseases, chronic liver diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Validate our product candidates and our platform in clinical proof-of-concept studies. We intend to demonstrate clinical proof-of-concept for DCR-PHXC (which is in development for all forms of PH) and for our other development programs. Based on precedents in the RNAi field, we are optimistic that our preclinical, which show the significant knockdown of target mRNA activity lasting for up to three months after the last dose and disease biomarker activity, potentially may translate into beneficial clinical results for these programs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Retain significant portions of the commercial rights for certain rare disease programs. We seek to retain a full or substantial ownership stake and invest internally in disease areas with focused patient populations, such as certain rare diseases. We see such diseases representing opportunities that carry high probabilities of success, have easily identifiable patient populations and a limited number of Centers of Excellence to facilitate reaching these patients, and have the potential for more rapid clinical development programs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Enter into additional collaborations with pharmaceutical companies either for our GalXC RNAi technology platform or specific indications or therapeutic areas. For more complex diseases with multiple gene dysfunctions and larger patient populations, we plan to pursue collaborations that can provide the enhanced scale, resources and commercial infrastructure required to maximize these prospects, such as our collaboration with BI for the treatment of chronic liver diseases. We may choose to establish collaborations with pharmaceutical companies across multiple programs or specific indication areas, either before or after clinical proof-of-concept, depending on the attractiveness of the opportunities. These collaborations may provide us with further validation of our technology platform, funding to advance our proprietary product candidates, or access to development, manufacturing and commercial capabilities.

 | Continue to invest in our RNAi technology platform and intellectual property. We plan to continue to invest in expanding and improving our GalXC RNAi platform technology. We believe we have a robust patent portfolio covering our proprietary GalXC RNAi platform and other RNAi technologies. As of March 7, 2018, our patent estate, not including the patents and patent applications we have licensed, included over 35 issued patents or allowed patent applications and over 100 pending patent applications supporting commercial development of our RNAi molecules and delivery technologies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Leverage the experience and the expertise of our executive management team. To execute on our strategy, we have assembled an executive management team that has extensive experience in the biopharmaceutical industry. In addition, various members of our management team and our board of directors have contributed to the progress of the RNAi field through their substantial involvement in companies such as Cephalon Inc., Genta Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Pfizer Inc., Sanofi S.A (Sanofi), Sirna Therapeutics, Inc. (Sirna), and other companies. Our co-founder and chief executive officer, Douglas M. Fambrough III, Ph.D., was a lead venture capital investor and board member of Sirna, an early RNAi company acquired by Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck) in 2006 for $1.1 billion.

Corporate Developments 
 Underwritten Public Offering of Common Stock 
 On December 18, 2017, we completed an underwritten follow-on public offering of 5,714,286 shares of common stock (the 2017 Offering). In connection with the 2017 Offering, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated and Evercore Group LLC as representatives of the underwriters listed in the Underwriting Agreement (collectively, the Underwriters), pursuant to which we granted to the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 857,143 shares of the Companys common stock (the Overallotment). We completed the sale of 6,571,428 shares, including the exercise of the Overallotment, to the Underwriters on December 18, 2017, and that sale resulted in the receipt by the Company of aggregate gross proceeds of $46.0 million, less Underwriter commissions and additional offering expenses totaling approximately $3.2 million. 
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock 
 Dicerna no longer has any outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock. On April 11, 2017, pursuant to a redeemable convertible preferred stock purchase agreement (SPA) with seven institutional investors (the Preferred Holders), led by funds advised by Bain Capital Life Sciences L.P. (the Lead Investor), we issued and sold 700,000 shares of our newly designated Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (Redeemable Convertible Preferred) to the Preferred Holders in a private placement for aggregate gross proceeds of $70.0 million, less issuance costs of approximately $0.8 million (the Private Placement). In addition to the Lead Investor, other participants in the Private Placement included affiliates of Cormorant Asset Management LLC, Domain Associates LLC (Domain Associates), EcoR1 Capital LLC, RA Capital Management LLC (RA Capital) and Skyline Management LLC (Skyline Ventures), among others. Domain Associates, RA Capital and Skyline Ventures are entities that are affiliated or were formerly affiliated with certain members of our board of directors. 
 Per a Certificate of Designation, which was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, each holder of Redeemable Convertible Preferred had been entitled to receive cumulative dividends on the Accrued Value, as defined below, of each share of Redeemable Convertible Preferred at an initial rate of 12% per annum, compounded quarterly and subject to two rate reductions, of 4% each, upon the occurrence of certain agreed-upon milestone events. Entering into the BI Agreement constituted a milestone event for purposes of applying the first of two allowable rate reductions to dividends payable on the Redeemable Convertible Preferred. As such, the dividend rate on the Redeemable Convertible Preferred was reduced from 12% to 8% on October 27, 2017. Dividends on the Redeemable Convertible Preferred accrued on the Accrued Value of each share of 
 
10 


  Redeemable Convertible Preferred until the conversion thereof, which occurred on December 18, 2017, as discussed below. Accrued Value meant, with respect to each share of Redeemable Convertible Preferred, the sum of (i) $100.00 plus (ii) on each quarterly dividend date, an additional amount equal to the dollar value of any dividends on a share of Redeemable Convertible Preferred which had accrued on any dividend payment date and had not previously been added to such Accrued Value. 
 On March 28, 2017, in accordance with the terms of the SPA, our board of directors voted to increase the size of the board from eight directors to nine directors and approved the appointment of Adam M. Koppel, M.D., Ph.D., a managing director of the Lead Investor, as a director of the Company, effective as of the closing of the Private Placement on April 11, 2017, to fill the resulting vacancy. Dr. Koppel was reelected to the Companys board of directors by shareholder vote in June 2017. We also entered into a registration rights agreement, by and among us and the Preferred Holders (the Registration Rights Agreement), pursuant to which the Preferred Holders are entitled to certain demand, shelf and piggyback registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred, subject to the limitations set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement. The shares of Redeemable Convertible Preferred and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred were offered and sold by us pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section 4(a)(2) thereunder. 
 In connection with the 2017 Offering, we entered into a letter agreement (the Letter Agreement) with the holders of all of the outstanding shares of our Redeemable Convertible Preferred. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Preferred Holders agreed, subject to the completion of the 2017 Offering, to optionally convert all of their shares of Redeemable Convertible Preferred into common stock. The Letter Agreement also provided for Preferred Holders to waive and amend certain provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement. In consideration for the Preferred Holders agreeing to the optional conversion of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred and to a waiver under and certain amendments to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company agreed to issue to the Preferred Holders shares of the Companys common stock. Under the Letter Agreement, the number of shares allocable to each Preferred Holder equaled the number of shares of common stock into which the additional dividend accruals on the Redeemable Convertible Preferred that such Preferred Holders would have been entitled to receive up to and including March 31, 2018 are convertible, calculated immediately prior to the effectiveness of the conversion (the Additional Investor Shares). The formula for the Additional Investor Shares assumed (1) a conversion price of $3.19 per share of common stock; (2) application of a dividend rate of 12% per annum from April 11, 2017 to October 27, 2017 and (3) application of a dividend rate of 8% per annum commencing from October 28, 2017 through March 31, 2018. March 31, 2018 is approximately the date at which the Company expected to be able to force conversion of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred into shares of common stock, pursuant to the terms of the SPA. On December 18, 2017, we issued an aggregate of 24,206,663 common shares upon full conversion of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred, and no shares of Redeemable Convertible Preferred remain outstanding. In addition to an increase in net loss per share attributable to common shareholders as a result of the recording of deemed and actual dividends, the ultimate impact of the April transaction on the Companys consolidated balance sheet and capital structure, excluding the impact of share issuance costs, was the receipt of $70 million of gross cash proceeds and the issuance of 24,206,663 common shares, or $2.89 per share. This compares to a closing per share price of the Companys common stock of $2.68 on March 28, 2017, the date of signing of the SPA. 
 On December 29, 2017, we filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Elimination of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred, which eliminates from our Certificate of Incorporation all matters set forth in the Certificate of Designation of Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock previously filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which established and designated the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and the rights, powers, preferences, privileges and limitations thereof.

 Our GalXC RNAi Technology Platform 
 The RNAi Therapeutic Modality 
 All of our GalXC drug discovery and development efforts are based on the therapeutic modality of RNAi, a highly potent and specific mechanism for silencing the activity of a targeted gene. In this naturally occurring biological process, double-stranded RNA molecules induce the enzymatic destruction of the mRNA of a target gene that contains sequences that are complementary to one strand of the therapeutic double-stranded RNA molecule. Our approach is to design proprietary double-stranded RNA molecules that have the potential to engage the enzyme Dicer and initiate an RNAi process to silence a specific target gene. These proprietary molecules are generally referred to as Dicer Substrate short-interfering RNAs (DsiRNAs). Our GalXC RNAi platform utilizes a particular Dicer Substrate structure configured for subcutaneous delivery to the liver. Due to the enzymatic nature of RNAi, a single GalXC molecule incorporated into the RNAi machinery can destroy hundreds or thousands of mRNAs from the targeted gene. 
 RNAi therapeutics represent a novel advance in drug development. Historically, the pharmaceutical industry has developed small molecules or antibodies to inhibit the activity of disease-causing proteins. This approach is effective for many diseases; nevertheless, many proteins cannot be inhibited by either small molecules or antibodies. Some proteins lack the binding pockets small molecules require for interaction. Other proteins are solely intracellular and therefore inaccessible to antibody-based therapeutics, which are limited to cell surface and extracellular proteins. The novel advantage of RNAi is that instead of targeting proteins, RNAi goes upstream to silence the genes themselves, via the targeted destruction of the mRNAs made from the gene. Rather than seeking to inhibit a protein directly, the RNAi approach is to prevent its creation in the first place. 
 We believe our approach to RNAi drug development provides the following qualities and advantages compared to other methods of inducing RNAi. 
 

 | We initiate RNAi through the Dicer enzyme. Our GalXC molecules are structured to be processed by the enzyme Dicer, the initiation point for RNAi in the human cell cytoplasm. Unlike earlier generation RNAi molecules, which mimic the output product of Dicer processing, all our DsiRNAs, including GalXC molecules, enter the RNAi pathway prior to Dicer processing. This can result in preferential use of the correct strand of a double-stranded RNA molecule, and therefore increase the efficacy of the RNAi mechanism. We have found in animal tests that this benefit both increases the potency of our GalXC molecules relative to other RNAi-inducing molecules and enables more sequences to be used compared to other RNAi-inducing molecules. In addition, all our DsiRNAs, including GalXC molecules, have an extended structure relative to conventional RNAi inducing molecules. This extended region presents multiple sites for chemical modification and conjugation compared to earlier RNAi technologies. At these sites, we can use modifications that enhance the drug-like properties on our molecules. Specifically, we can employ modifications that enhance the pharmacokinetic profile and/or suppress immunostimulatory activity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our GalXC RNAi platform enables subcutaneous dosing for delivery to the liver. The GalXC RNAi platform is designed to enable convenient subcutaneous delivery for our emerging pipeline of liver-targeted RNAi investigational therapies. The GalXC RNAi platform does not involve LNPs or other formulation components that facilitate drug delivery, which simplifies the platform and eliminates any requirement for functional excipients. Instead, our GalXC molecules are stabilized by chemical modifications and utilize a four base sequence known as a tetraloop, where each base is conjugated to a simple sugar, N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), that is specifically recognized by a receptor on the surface of hepatocyte liver cells. With the GalXC RNAi platform, we believe that a full human dose may be administered via a single subcutaneous injection. After injection, the GalXC molecules enter the bloodstream and are exposed to the liver hepatocytes expressing the GalNAc receptor. After binding to the receptor, the GalXC molecules are internalized by the hepatocyte, ultimately enabling the GalXC molecules to access the RNAi machinery inside the hepatocyte. To date, we have demonstrated in vivo gene silencing activity with GalXC molecules after subcutaneous administration against nearly three dozen disease-associated genes in the liver.

 Optimization of our GalXC molecules 
 For therapeutic use in humans, our GalXC molecules are optimized both with respect to base sequence and chemical modifications to increase stability and mask them from mechanisms that recognize foreign RNAs, in order to avoid inducing immune system stimulation. Our optimization process begins with an analysis of the target gene sequence using our proprietary GalXC prediction algorithm, which we have developed based on the results of testing thousands of sequences for RNAi activity. We select the sequences with the highest predicted RNAi activity and apply patterns of chemical modification, including a GalNAc-linked tetraloop stem-loop structure, which design-in enhanced stability and hepatocyte delivery specificity and engineers-out immunostimulatory activity. Our GalXC molecules routinely achieve high potencies, with EC50 values in the liver (i.e. the amount of material required to silence a target gene by 50 percent) typically in the 0.1 to 1.0 milligram per kilogram bodyweight (mg/kg) range in in vivo studies in mice. We have routinely generated GalXC molecules of this potency within 30 days of doing the initial algorithmic gene sequence analysis, which allows us to explore a large number of potential target genes when selecting our programs. 
 Our Product Candidates 
 In choosing clinical programs to pursue using our GalXC technology, we apply the criteria listed below. We believe that our current development programs meet most or all of these criteria. 

 | Strength of therapeutic hypothesis. Our current product candidate gene targets, and those we intend to pursue in the future, are a well-understood part of the disease process where a therapeutic intervention is likely to have substantial benefit for the patient.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Readily-identified patient population. We seek disease indications where patients can be readily identified by the presence of characteristic genetic mutations or other readily-accessible disease features. In the case of genetic diseases, these are heritable genetic mutations that can be identified with available genetic tests.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Predictivity of biomarkers for early efficacy assessment. We seek disease indications where there is a clear relationship between the disease status and an associated biomarker that we can readily measure. This approach will allow us to determine in early stages of clinical development whether our GalXC molecules are likely to have the expected biological and clinical effects in patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Unmet medical need. We seek to provide patients with significant benefit and alleviation of disease. The indications we choose to approach have high unmet medical need, which is intended to enable us to better access patients and qualify for pricing and reimbursement that justify our development efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Competitive positioning. We seek indications where we believe we have the opportunity to develop either a first-in-class product or a clearly differentiated therapy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Rapid development path to approval. To reach commercialization expeditiously and to help ensure our ability to finance development of our product candidates, we have identified indications with the potential for rapid development through marketing approval. Specifically, we believe that some of our product candidates have the potential to obtain breakthrough therapy designation as well as accelerated review process from the FDA.

 DCR-PHXC for PH 
 We are developing DCR-PHXC for the treatment of all types of PH. PH is a family of rare inborn errors of metabolism in which the liver produces excessive levels of oxalate, which in turn causes damage to the kidneys and to other tissues in the body. In preclinical models of PH, DCR-PHXC reduces oxalate production to near-normal levels, ameliorating the disease condition. 
 PH encompasses three genetically distinct, autosomal-recessive, inborn errors of glyoxylate metabolism characterized by the over-production of oxalate, a highly insoluble metabolic end-product that is eliminated 
 
13 


  mainly by the kidney. Patients with PH are predisposed to the development of multiple and recurrent urinary tract (urolithiasis) and kidney (nephrolithiasis) stones. Calculi formation is accompanied by nephrocalcinosis in some patients with PH (PH1 and some patients with PH2). This deposition of calcium oxalate in the renal parenchyma produces tubular toxicity and renal damage that is compounded by the effects of renal calculi related obstruction and frequent superimposed infections. Based on evaluation of genome sequence databases, there may be as many as 16,000 people with PH in the US and major European countries. 
 PH1, PH2 and PH type 3 (PH3), are each characterized by a specific enzyme deficiency. PH1 is characterized by a deficiency of the liver peroxisomal enzyme alanine: glyoxylate-aminotransferase. Patients with PH1 represent approximately 80% of all patients currently diagnosed with PH. PH2 and PH3 are caused by dysfunction of glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase and 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase, respectively. Most patients are diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood. At present, no therapies are approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of patients with PH. A number of supportive therapies are used in an attempt to mitigate some of the effects of the disease. Current medical management before renal failure develops is underpinned by hyperhydration with fluid intake recommendations of at least 3 liters per day per square meter of body-surface area (5 L/day for a 70-kg adult). These regimens can be problematic in infants and toddlers, necessitating placement of a gastrostomy tube to ensure adequate night time fluid administration. Affected patients are at considerable risk of serious complications during periods of increased fluid loss (fever, diarrhea/vomiting, and urinary tract infections) or when oral hydration is compromised (following surgical procedures). Oral potassium citrate administration is used to inhibit crystallization and alkalinize the urine. In PH1, an approximately 30% or greater reduction in urinary oxalate excretion may be achieved with oral vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) administration at doses from 5 to 20 mg/kg in a small proportion of affected patients (10-20% of all PH1 patients). 
 For patients with more advanced disease, dialysis may be used in an attempt to remove endogenously over-produced oxalate. In contrast to 3 times weekly hemodialysis regimens more typically used in other types of renal failure, patients with PH may require hemodialysis 6 or 7 days per week. Given the limitations of dialysis and the inability to impact oxalate over-production substantially in most patients with PH1, most centers now consider liver transplantation approaches earlier in the disease course to minimize the risk of irreversible tissue damage. Current treatments include renal transplantation or, in PH1, combined liver and kidney transplantation. As with organ transplantation in other disease, these procedures are associated with significant medical risk and a requirement for long-term treatment with immunosuppressive drugs that are also associated with significant side effects. 
 We believe that there is a strong rationale for focusing our RNAi technology on the development of product candidates for the treatment of PH. On July 15, 2017, in a series of presentations at the 12th International Workshop, we presented new preclinical data suggesting the potential utility of DCR-PHXC for treating all forms of PH. In particular, we presented research from animal models demonstrating how DCR-PHXC inhibits the LDHA gene, which we have identified as potentially being an optimal therapeutic target in patients with PH. LDHA inhibition was shown in animal models to reduce oxalate to normal or near-normal levels in PH1, PH2 and ethylene glycol-induced hyperoxaluria (a model for idiopathic PH). 
 LDHA reduction has a near-linear correlation with oxalate reduction and offers a minimal metabolic intervention. These benefits of LDHA inhibition may translate into consistent therapeutic activity even in the event of a missed dose. There are numerous case reports of LDHA deficiency naturally occurring in humans, with no reported adverse effects due to deficiency in the liver. 
 On October 16, 2017, we announced that we had submitted a CTA for DCR-PHXC to the MHRA in the UK. On December 7, 2017, we announced that we dosed the first human in our Phase 1 trial for DCR-PHXC, called PHYOX. We plan to dose the first patient with PH in PHYOX in the second quarter of 2018 and expect to have clinical proof-of-concept data in the second half of 2018. We have submitted CTAs in Germany, France and the Netherlands. Additionally, we expect to initiate a multi-dose Phase 2/3 study in the first quarter of 2019, pending positive POC data and regulatory approval.

 Chronic Hepatitis B Virus infection 
 We are currently using our GalXC RNAi platform to investigate potential pharmaceutical treatments that target HBV. Current therapies for HBV rarely lead to a long-term immunological cure as measured by the clearance of HBsAg and sustained HBV DNA suppression in patient plasma or blood. We have declared a GalXC RNAi platform-based product candidate, DCR-HBVS, and are conducting formal non-clinical development studies. We expect to file an IND and/or a CTA during the fourth quarter of 2018. DCR-HBVS targets HBV messenger RNA. Based on preclinical studies, and only if we receive appropriate regulatory approval to begin human clinical trials, we hope to determine the potential of DCR-HBVS to reduce HBsAg expression and HBV DNA in HBV patients in a subcutaneous dosing paradigm. 
 According to the Hepatitis B Foundation, globally, HBV is reported to be the most common serious liver infection with over 250 million patients chronically infected, according to an estimate by the World Health Organization. Annual mortality directly linked to chronic HBV infection is estimated to be approximately 780,000 people with an estimated 650,000 of these deaths caused by cirrhosis and liver cancer as a result of chronic hepatitis B, and a further 130,000 of these deaths from complications associated with acute disease. Chronic HBV is characterized by the presence of the HBsAg for six months or more. 
 Nucleoside analogs and pegylated interferon regimens have been utilized to suppress the virus; however, while the regimens can offer long-term viral suppression if taken continuously, they do not provide a cure. The vast majority of treated patients do not achieve an immunological cure of chronic HBV infection under treatment with these agents. The chance of achieving a long-term immunological cure as measured by the clearance of HBsAg and sustained HBV DNA suppression may be possible with the introduction of novel drugs designed to reduce intrahepatic and serum HBsAg, as well as HBV DNA. 
 An undisclosed rare disease involving the liver 
 We are developing a GalXC-based therapeutic, targeting a liver-expressed gene involved in a serious rare disease. For competitive reasons, we have not yet publicly disclosed the target gene or disease. We have selected this target gene and disease based on criteria that include having a strong therapeutic hypothesis, a readily-identifiable patient population, the availability of a potentially predictive biomarker, high unmet medical need, favorable competitive positioning and what we believe is a rapid projected path to approval. The disease is a genetic disorder, where mutations in the disease gene lead to the production of an abnormal protein. The protein causes progressive liver damage and fibrosis, in some cases leading to cirrhosis and liver failure, and we believe that silencing of the disease gene will prevent production of the abnormal protein and thereby slow or stop progression of the liver fibrosis. Greater than 100,000 people in the U.S. are believed to be homozygous for the mutation that causes the liver disease, and at least 10% of those people, and potentially a significantly higher fraction, are believed to have liver-associated disease as a consequence. We plan to seek a risk-sharing collaborator for the program before we file an IND application and/or CTA for this program, which we expect to be prepared to file in the second quarter of 2018. 
 Hypercholesterolemia 
 We are using our GalXC RNAi platform to develop a therapeutic that targets the PCSK9 gene for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Dicerna has selected a provisional clinical candidate for the program, but is continuing to explore ways to further optimize the program. PCSK9 is a validated target for hypercholesterolemia, and there are FDA-approved therapies targeting PCSK9 that are based on MAb technology. Based on preclinical studies, we believe that our GalXC RNAi platform can produce a PCSK9-targeted therapy with more attractive commercial and treatment properties than existing MAb therapies, based on comparatively smaller subcutaneous injection volumes and less frequent dosing, while providing equal or superior control of serum cholesterol. 
 Hypercholesterolemia is characterized by abnormally high blood serum levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and is one of the key known risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
 
15 


  Managing hypercholesterolemia by lowering LDL is one of the cornerstones of the strategy to reduce the risk of CVD morbidity and mortality. 
 The use of statins to lower LDL and reduce CVD morbidity and mortality has been successful, although many patients may benefit from additional and alternative therapeutics that more aggressively lower LDL. It is estimated that 35 million U.S. patients are treated with statin therapy with approximately 12 million of these patients classified as suffering from CVD placing them at higher risk of CVD morbidity and mortality. Roughly 37%, or 4.5 million, of these higher risk CVD patients, are not treated to their LDL goal with standard of care therapy: diet and statin drugs. Inhibition of the circulating protein PCSK9 using anti-PCSK9 MAbs has been a strategy utilized to more aggressively lower serum LDL levels than with statin therapy alone. 
 Additional pipeline programs 
 In addition to the programs discussed above, we have applied our GalXC technology to multiple gene targets across our disease focus areas of rare diseases, chronic liver diseases and cardiovascular diseases. Pursuant to our strategy, we are seeking collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies to advance our programs in the areas of chronic liver diseases and cardiovascular diseases. Both these disease areas represent large and diverse patient populations, requiring complex clinical development and commercialization paths that we believe can be more effectively be pursued in collaboration with larger pharmaceutical companies more experienced in these types of programs. The BI Agreement is an example of such a collaboration. For our additional rare diseases, we are continuing to assess their potential for clinical success and market opportunity while optimizing our GalXC molecules. 
 We also have developed a wholly owned clinical candidate, DCR-BCAT, targeting the ß-catenin oncogene. DCR-BCAT is based on an extended version of our earlier generation Dicer Substrate RNAi technology and is delivered by our LNP tumor delivery system, EnCoreTM. We plan to out-license or spin out the DCR-BCAT opportunity, given our focus on our GalXC platform-based programs. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We invest significant amounts in research and development. Our research and development expenses were approximately $37.0 million, $41.7 million and $44.0 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 We are seeking multifaceted protection for our intellectual property that includes licenses, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators, subcontractors and other third parties and generally control access to our documentation and proprietary information. 
 Patents and proprietary rights 
 We own U.S. patents and a number of pending patent applications with claims to methods and compositions of matter that cover various aspects of our RNAi technology and our discovery technologies, including our proprietary GalXC technology. These U.S. patents include: U.S. 8,349,809 (issued in January 2013, with a projected expiration date of January 2030); U.S. 8,513,207 (issued in August 2013, with a projected expiration date of May 2030); and U.S. 8,927,705 (issued in January 2015, with a projected expiration date of July 2030). We also own numerous patents and patent applications covering specific RNAi sequences that drive activity against high value disease targets, including: KRAS (U.S. 8,372,816; issued in February 2013, with projected expiration in April 2030); HAO1 (U.S. 9,828,606; issued November 2017, with projected expiration in December 2034); CTNNB1 (ß-catenin; U.S. 9,428,752, issued in August 2016, with projected expiration in July 2031); and Alpha-1-antitrypsin (U.S. 9,458,457, issued October 4, 2016, with projected expiration in July 2034). Further, we own various applications and patents with claims to methods and compositions of matter related to 
 
16 


  our lipid delivery technology, such as lipid compositions (e.g., U.S. 9,549,983 directed to specific lipid compositions, issued in January 2017, with projected expiration in October 2032) and particle formulations. We have issued or pending claims to RNAi molecules, pharmaceutical compositions/formulations, methods of use, including in vitro and in vivo methods of reducing target gene expression, methods of treatment, methods of inhibiting cell growth and methods of synthesis. 
 We jointly own with KHK U.S. and foreign patent applications pursuant to our research collaboration and license agreement claiming developments made in the course of the collaboration focused on delivery of KRAS-specific DsiRNA molecules, including the EnCore formulation process. Depending on the subject matter of future issued claims, we may also jointly own future patents issuing from patent applications filed under the research collaboration and license agreement with KHK. 
 Our strategy around protection of our proprietary technology, including any innovations and improvements, is to obtain patent coverage in various jurisdictions around the world with a focus on jurisdictions that represent significant global pharmaceutical markets. Generally, patents have a term of 20 years from the earliest non-provisional priority date, assuming that all maintenance fees are paid, no portion of the patent has been terminally disclaimed and the patent has not been invalidated. In certain jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances, patent terms can be extended or shortened. We are obtaining worldwide patent protection for at least novel molecules, composition of matter, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, including treatment of disease, methods of manufacture and other novel uses for the inventive molecules originating from our research and development efforts. We continuously assess whether it is strategically more favorable to maintain confidentiality for the know-how regarding a novel invention rather than pursue patent protection. For each patent application that is filed we strategically tailor our claims in accordance with the existing patent landscape around a particular technology. 
 We cannot predict with any certainty if any third-party U.S. or foreign patent rights, other proprietary rights, will be deemed infringed by the use of our technology. Nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. Should we need to defend ourselves and our collaborators against any such claims, substantial costs may be incurred. Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the U.S. and abroad, and could result in the award of substantial damages. In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our collaborators may be required to obtain one or more licenses from a third party. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license on a reasonable basis should we deem it necessary to obtain rights to an alternative technology that meets our needs. The failure to obtain a license may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets on a continuing basis. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. 
 See Item 1A Risk Factors  Risks Related to Intellectual Property for a more detailed discussion of the risks to our intellectual property. 
 It is our policy to require our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors who receive confidential information from us, to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to these individuals during the course of the individuals relationship with us is to be kept confidential and is not to be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. The agreements provide that all inventions conceived by an employee shall be our property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. 
 
17 


 Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection, preserve trade secrets, prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, both in the U.S. and other territories worldwide. 
 Strategic Collaborations 
 BI collaborative research and license agreement 
 On October 27, 2017, we entered into the BI Agreement, pursuant to which Dicerna and BI have agreed to jointly research and develop product candidates for the treatment of chronic liver disease, with an initial focus on NASH, using the GalXC platform, our proprietary RNAi-based technology. NASH is caused by the buildup of fat in the liver, potentially leading to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. It has an especially high prevalence among obese and diabetic patients and is an area of high unmet medical need. The BI Agreement is for the development of product candidates against one target gene with an option for BI to add the development of product candidates that target a second gene. Also pursuant to the BI Agreement, we granted BI a worldwide license in connection with the research and development of the product candidates and will transfer to BI intellectual property rights of the product candidates selected by BI for clinical development and commercialization. We also may provide assistance to BI in order to help BI further develop selected product candidates. Pursuant to the BI Agreement, BI agreed to pay us a non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million for the first target. During the term of the research program, BI will reimburse Dicerna the cost of materials and third-party expenses that have been included in the preclinical studies up to an agreed-upon limit. We are eligible to receive up to $191.0 million in potential development and commercial milestones related to the initial target. We are also eligible to receive royalty payments on potential global net sales, subject to certain adjustments, tiered from high single digits up to low double-digits. BIs option to add a second target would provide for an option fee payment and success-based development and commercialization milestones and royalty payments to us. 
 Through December 31, 2017, we have recognized $1.2 million in revenue associated with the BI Agreement. 
 KHK research collaboration and license agreement 
 In December 2009, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with KHK for the research, development and commercialization of drug delivery platforms and DsiRNA molecules for therapeutic targets, primarily in oncology (the KHK Collaboration Agreement). Under the KHK Collaboration Agreement, we engaged in the discovery of DsiRNA molecules against KRAS and other gene targets nominated by KHK. Since the initiation of the KHK Collaboration Agreement, of the various targets in the collaboration, two target programs, including the initial target KRAS, have been nominated by KHK for formal development studies. Both programs utilize our specific RNAi-inducing double-stranded DsiRNA molecules and a lipid nanoparticle drug delivery technology proprietary to KHK. We have granted KHK an exclusive license to certain of our technology and patents relating to compounds resulting from the collaboration. KHK has granted us certain non-exclusive licenses in its technology as necessary for us to perform research and development activities as part of the research collaboration. 
 In November 2017, KHK provided us with notice of termination related to the non-KRAS program. Given our current development focus, including the GalXC program, we no longer consider this agreement material to our business. 
 License Agreements 
 City of Hope license agreement 
 In September 2007, we entered into a license agreement with City of Hope (COH), an independent academic research and medical center, pursuant to which COH has granted to us an exclusive, royalty-bearing, 
 
18 


  worldwide license under certain patent rights in relation to DsiRNA. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed products in certain major markets. 
 The license agreement will remain in effect pursuant to its terms until all of the obligations under the license agreement with respect to the payment of milestones or royalties related to licensed products have terminated or expired. Either party may terminate the license agreement for any uncured material breach by the other party. COH may terminate the license agreement upon our bankruptcy or insolvency. We may terminate the license agreement without cause upon written notice to COH. The COH license applies to our collaboration with KHK. In 2017, we have elected not to make any further diligence extension payments. At this time, however, the license agreement remains in effect and discussions as to next steps are underway. Given our current development focus, including the GalXC program, we no longer consider this agreement material to our business. 
 Other Licenses 
 In December 2014, we licensed all of our non-U.S. intellectual property rights to a non-U.S. wholly owned subsidiary. In December 2015, we licensed our U.S. intellectual property rights to the same non-U.S. wholly owned subsidiary. In December 2016, the same non-U.S. wholly owned subsidiary distributed the U.S. intellectual property rights back to us. In 2017, we amended a licensing agreement with the non-U.S. subsidiary to exclude from the scope and operation of that agreement the intellectual property licensed to BI pursuant to the BI Agreement. As such, effective October 27, 2017 certain rights associated with the BI Agreement reverted to us. 
Manufacturing and Supply 
 We do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities for the production of preclinical, clinical or commercial quantities of any of our product candidates. For each product candidate, we currently contract with manufacturers, and we expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical and clinical requirements of our product candidates. We have entered into supply agreements with third parties for supply of certain products and services. 
 Currently, some of our drug starting materials for our manufacturing activities are supplied by a single source supplier. We have agreements for the supply of such drug materials with manufacturers or suppliers that we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands. In addition, we believe that adequate alternative sources for such supplies exist. However, there is a risk that, if supplies are interrupted, it would materially harm our business. We typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements. 
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our contract manufacturing organizations manufacture our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) conditions. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans. 
 Competition 
 We believe that our scientific knowledge and expertise in RNAi-based therapies provide us with competitive advantages over the various companies and other entities that are attempting to develop similar treatments. However, we face competition at the technology platform and therapeutic indication levels from both large and small biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise 
 
19 


  in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 Our success will be based in part upon our ability to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of drugs that are safer and more effective than competing products in the treatment of our targeted patients. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products we may develop. 
 RNA-based therapeutics 
 To our knowledge, there are no other companies developing GalXC molecules for therapeutic use. However, there are several companies that are currently developing RNAi-based therapies for various indications. We believe that Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Arrowhead), Alnylam and Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Arbutus) through their company-specific development or through various collaborations are developing RNAi-based therapies that are competing against our current programs or potential future programs. 
 Among these, Alnylam, in collaboration with Sanofi Genzyme (a division of Sanofi), is developing multiple genetic rare disease programs including its patisiran (ALN-TTR) program, which is an RNAi-based therapy for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN) and has completed Phase 3 trials. Alnylam announced the APOLLO study completed enrollment of 225 patients at 44 sites in 19 countries, between December 2013 and January 2016. In early November 2017, Alnylam and Sanofi Genzyme announced positive complete results from the APOLLO Phase 3 study of patisiran. On December 12, 2017, Alnylam announced it had completed submission of an NDA to the U.S. FDA for patisiran for the treatment of adults with hATTR amyloidosis and on December 18, 2017, Alnylam announced it had submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the same indication. Pending regulatory approvals, Alnylam will commercialize patisiran in the U.S., Canada and Western Europe, with Genzyme commercializing the product in the rest of the world. In November 2017, Alnylam announced positive preliminary data from a Phase 1/2 study of lumasiran (formerly known as ALN-GO1) in patients with PH. Additional genetic rare disease programs are being developed by Alnylam in collaboration with Sanofi Genzyme including ALN-TTRsc02 for all forms of ATTR amyloidosis; fitusiran (ALN-AT3), for the treatment of hemophilia and rare bleeding disorders; ALN-CC5 for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases; and ALN-AS1, for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyrias among others. In addition, Alnylam initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial with ALN-HBV for the treatment of HBV infection in mid-2016. In October 2017, Alnylam announced a collaboration with Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Vir) for the development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics for infectious diseases, including chronic HBV infection. The company also announced plans to discontinue further development of ALN-HBV and to advance a new product candidate ALN-HBV02, using the companys ESC+ GalNAc conjugate technology. The Medicines Company (MDCO) and its collaborator, Alnylam, are advancing an experimental PCSK9 RNAi therapy, inclisiran (formerly known as PCSK9si), for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In March 2017, Alnylam and MDCO announced positive final data from the ORION-1 Phase 2 study of inclisiran. The detailed data from ORION-1 showed that inclisiran delivered significant and sustained reductions of LDL-C and high standards of safety and tolerability. In November 2017, Alnylam and MDCO announced the initiation of the Phase 3 clinical program of inclisiran in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 
 Arbutus is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing RNAi-therapeutics for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. Arbutus has multiple HBV programs in development. ARB-1467 is in a multi-dose Phase 2 study in chronic HBV patients, which was initiated in December 2015. Arbutus reported results from this trial based on multiple dose administration of ARB-1467 in Cohorts 1, 2 and 3. The data demonstrated significant 
 
20 


  reductions in serum HBsAg levels and showed a step-wise, additive reduction in serum HBsAg with each subsequent dose. Arbutus also presented positive topline results for Cohort 4 (bi-weekly dosing). Overall treatment was well tolerated in all four cohorts. Arbutus has announced that new studies will utilize bi-weekly dosing in a combination study of ARB-1467, with current standard of care nucleot(s)ide analog and interferon therapies, to evaluate the opportunity to improve current cure rates with a finite dosing period. This study is ongoing. Arbutus also reported positive top-line results from a multi-dose healthy volunteer study of AB-423, Arbutuss core protein/capsid formation inhibitor program. The findings showed AB-423 was generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. Arbutus has stated that it expects to start a multi-dose study in HBV patients in the first quarter of 2018. AB-506, Arbutus next-generation capsid inhibitor program, is currently undergoing IND-enabling studies. Pending successful IND-enabling studies, this product candidate could be the subject of an IND (or equivalent) filing. Arbutus has rights under Alnylams intellectual property to develop RNAi therapeutic products. 
 Arrowhead is developing RNAi therapeutics and has multiple programs in preclinical development. Arrowheads most advanced programs include ARO-AAT to treat liver diseases associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and ARO-HBV for chronic HBV. In December 2017, Arrowhead filed regulatory submissions to begin human clinical trials for ARO-AAT and ARO-HBV in New Zealand. Arrowheads other preclinical programs include: ARO-APOC3 for hypertriglyceridemia; ARO-ANG3 for hypertriglyceridemia; ARO-Lung1 for an undisclosed disease of the lung; ARO-F12 for factor 12 mediated diseases, such as hereditary angioedema and thromboembolic disorders; ARO-HIF2, for the treatment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma associated with HIF-2a; ARO-LPA targeting a polipoprotein A for cardiovascular disease; and ARO-AMG1 for an undisclosed genetically validated cardiovascular target. 
 In addition to RNAi therapies, there are other intracellular technologies focused on silencing the activity of specific genes by targeting mRNAs copied from them. Companies such as miRagen Therapeutics, Inc., Regulus Therapeutics Inc. and Santaris Pharma A/S, which was acquired by F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG in 2014 and is now known as Roche Innovation Center Copenhagen, target or inhibit or replace microRNAs, which are approximately 22 nucleotides in length, short, non-coding RNAs, to alter mRNA expression levels. 
 Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ionis) is discovering and developing RNA-targeted therapeutics based on its antisense technology across multiple therapeutic areas, including severe and rare diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic HBV. Ioniss commercial products include KYNAMRO® (mipomersen sodium) injection for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) targeting ApoB-100, which is partnered to Kastle Therapeutics, LLC and Spinraza (nusinersen), which received FDA approval for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy in pediatric and adult patients in December 2016. Biogen Inc. is responsible for commercialization of Spinraza. Ionis has a product pipeline with over two dozen drugs in clinical development. Volanesorsen, a drug candidate in Phase 3 development that Ionis is developing and plans to commercialize through its majority-owned subsidiary, Akcea Therapeutics, Inc. (Akcea) targets Apo-CIII to treat patients with either familial chylomicronemia syndrome or familial partial lipodystrophy. During the third quarter of 2017, Akcea, working closely with Ionis, filed for marketing authorization for volanesorsen in the U.S., EU and Canada. Akcea is preparing to commercialize volanesorsen for both familial chylomicronemia syndrome and familial partial lipodystrophy, if approved. Additional Phase 3 programs include: IONIS-TTRRx, a drug Ionis is developing with GlaxoSmithKline plc to treat patients with TTR amyloidosis, alicaforsen targeting ICAM-1 for the treatment of pouchitis, an inflammatory bowel disease, which is partnered with Atlantic Healthcare plc; and plazomicin, in development to treat severe bacterial infection and partnered with Achaogen, Inc. In addition, Ionis has multiple programs in Phase 2 development for cardiometabolic diseases and HBV infection, a Phase 2 program for NAFLD/metabolic complications and a Phase 1 program in NASH, as well as clinical programs in many other disease areas. 
 If our lead product candidates are approved for the indications for which we undertake clinical trials, they may compete with therapies that are either in development or currently marketed by our competitors.

 Primary Hyperoxaluria 
 Currently, there are no approved drugs to treat primary hyperoxaluria. The current standard of care for treating PH is a dual-organ transplant, namely a kidney and liver transplant in patients with PH, which is often difficult to perform due to lack of donors and the threat of organ rejection. Other treatments include pyridoxine regimens and intensive dialysis, as well as treatments generally used in kidney stone disorders such as high-volume fluid intake and oral citrate. These other treatments do not halt disease progression. OxThera AB has a competing approach to PH treatment, currently in late stage clinical development, which is not RNAi-based. In January 2016, Alnylam announced its plans to start a Phase 1 clinical trial for lumasiran (formerly known as ALN-GO1), an investigational RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of PH1. Alnylam presented initial Phase 1 clinical data from its NHV portion of the study in the third quarter of 2016 at the IPNA. In November 2017, Alnylam announced positive preliminary data from a Phase 1/2 study of lumasiran in patients with PH. Allena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has announced its plans to initiate, in the first quarter of 2018, a Phase 2 clinical trial of ALLN-177, a first-in-class, non-absorbed, orally-administered enzyme for the treatment of hyperoxaluria in adolescents and adults with PH or severe forms of secondary hyperoxaluria, with interim data expected in the second half of 2018. 
Hypercholesterolemia 
 Repatha® (evolocumab) was the second PCSK9 MAb inhibitor to receive FDA approval. Developed by Amgen, Inc. (Amgen), Repatha was approved in August 2015 for use in addition to diet and maximally-tolerated statin therapy in adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, HoFH, or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks or strokes, who require additional lowering of LDL cholesterol. 
 Praluent® (alirocumab) was approved in July 2015 and launched in the U.S. as a second line treatment for adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease whose LDL cholesterol is not adequately controlled by diet and statin treatment. Alirocumab was the first anti-PCSK9 MAb to receive FDA approval and was developed by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron). In October 2017, Regeneron and Sanofi announced that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has ordered a new trial and vacated the permanent injunction in the dispute concerning Amgens asserted patent claims for antibodies targeting PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9). This ruling means that Sanofi and Regeneron will continue marketing, selling and manufacturing Praluent® (alirocumab) injection in the U.S. A Phase 3 study of Praluent® (alirocumab) injection in HoFH was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
 There are additional anti-PCSK9 MAb therapies in clinical development. Multiple cardiovascular outcome studies are being conducted with the anti-PCSK9 MAb therapies to determine if these higher risk patients will have superior cardiovascular outcomes vs. patients treated with standard of care. On February 2, 2017, Amgen announced that the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk) trial studying Repathas ability to reduce cardiovascular risk in atherosclerotic patients met its primary endpoint. On March 17, 2017, at the American College of Cardiologys 66th Annual Scientific Session, Amgen presented positive results showing that Repatha (Evolocumab) decreases LDL-C levels and reduces risk of cardiovascular events. 
 MDCO and its collaborator, Alnylam, are advancing an experimental PCSK9 RNAi therapy, inclisiran (formerly PCSK9si), which has a similar mechanism of action as Dicernas GalXC PCSK9 compound. Inclisiran is being studied in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase 2 trial of single or multiple subcutaneous injections in a total of 501 patients with ASCVD or ASCVD-risk equivalents (e.g., diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia) and elevated LDL-C despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C lowering therapies. The primary endpoint of the study, known as ORION-1, is the percentage change in LDL-C levels from baseline at Day 180. Preliminary topline data from the study, presented at the American Heart Association 
 
22 


  Scientific Sessions in November 2016, show that inclisiran was generally well tolerated and no material safety issue was observed, including no elevations of liver enzymes considered related to study medication and no neuropathy or change in renal function, and that the study met all interim analysis goals. In March 2017, Alnylam and MDCO announced positive final data from the ORION-1 Phase 2 study of inclisiran. The detailed data from ORION-1 showed that inclisiran delivered significant and sustained reductions of LDL-C and high standards of safety and tolerability. In November 2017, Alnylam and MDCO announced the initiation of the Phase 3 clinical program of inclisiran in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ASCVD. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, record-keeping, advertising, distribution, sampling, pricing, sales and marketing, safety, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and the extensive laws and regulations that apply to drug products and product candidates in the U.S. are subject to change. 
 U.S. government regulation 
 NDA approval processes 
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA) and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development or approval process, or after approval, may result in a delay of approval or subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include: 
 

 | refusal to approve pending applications;
--+-----------------------------------------


 | withdrawal of an approval;
--+---------------------------


 | imposition of a clinical hold;
--+-------------------------------


 | issuance of warning or untitled letters;
--+-----------------------------------------


 | product recalls;
--+-----------------


 | product seizures;
--+------------------


 | refusals of government contracts;
--+----------------------------------


 | total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


 | injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally includes the following: 
 

 | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs) or other applicable laws and regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an institutional review board (IRB) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
23 


 
 | performance and inspection of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials and clinical data according to FDA regulations and Good Clinical Practices (GCP) to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission of an NDA to the FDA and the FDAs acceptance of the NDA for filing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product candidates identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the major investigational sites to ensure data integrity and assess compliance with GCP requirements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, stability, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the nonclinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND. 
 All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with FDA regulations and GCP. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must timely report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. All research subjects or their legally authorized representatives must provide their informed consent in writing prior to their participation in a clinical trial. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol and the informed consent form before a clinical trial commences at that institution, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. Information about most clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to be publicly posted on the ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined. 
 

 | Phase 1The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed. The FDA, the sponsor, or a data safety monitoring board, may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 During the development of a new product candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of an NDA. If a Phase 2 clinical trial is the subject of discussion at the end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the safety, identity, strength, purity, and quality of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and tested and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA will also typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA regulations and GCP. 
 The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
 Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. The FDA typically requires that an NDA include data from two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, but approval may be based upon a single adequate and well-controlled clinical trial in certain circumstances. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the 
 
25 


  product labeling. In addition, the FDA may condition approval on the completion of post approval studies. Such studies may involve clinical trials designed to further assess a products safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. If the FDA determines that it is necessary to ensure the safe use of the drug, the FDA may also condition approval on the implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS). The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. 
 Expedited review and approval 
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, breakthrough, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing product candidates. Generally, product candidates that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. A sponsor can request application of these programs either alone or in combination with each other, depending on the circumstances. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. None of the expedited approval programs change the NDA approval standard applied to a product. 
 New drugs are eligible for Fast Track status if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track status entitles such a drug to expedited review and frequent contact with the FDA review division. Unlike other expedited review programs, Fast Track designation allows the FDA to accept for review individual sections of the NDA on a rolling basis. The FDA may also grant a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months from filing of an NDA, rather than the standard review of ten months from filing under current Prescription Drug User Fee Act guidelines. Most products that are eligible for Fast Track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 
 Drug products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA typically requires that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval conduct post-approval clinical trials. As an additional condition of approval, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of all promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 The FDA may expedite the approval of a designated breakthrough therapy, which is a drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A sponsor may request that a drug be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product. If the FDA designates a drug as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA must take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug; providing timely advice to the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable.

 In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), was signed into law. The Cures Act included numerous provisions that may be relevant to our product candidates, including provisions designed to speed development of innovative and breakthrough therapies. The Cures Act amends the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, to reauthorize and expand funding for the NIH and to authorize the FDA to increase spending on innovation projects. Central to the Cures Act are provisions that enhance and accelerate the FDAs processes for reviewing and approving new drugs and supplements to approved NDAs. The Cures Act also includes a provision that requires certain manufacturers or distributors of an investigational drug to make their policies on the availability of certain expanded access programs publicly available. Because the Cures Act was enacted relatively recently and the FDA may take several years to develop these policies, it is difficult to know whether or how the Cures Act will affect our business. 
 Patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product candidates approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half of the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product candidate is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A product candidate is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new product candidate containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the product candidate substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA (i.e., an NDA that contains full safety and effectiveness reports but allows at least some of the information required for NDA approval to come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant) submitted by another company for another version of such product candidate where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing product candidate. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for product candidates containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Orphan drug designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to product candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 
 
27 


  individuals in the U.S. or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a product candidate for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that product candidate. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product candidate is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications including a full NDA to market the same product candidate for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product candidate as defined by the FDA prior to us. 
 On August 8, 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA) was enacted. FDARA, among other things, codified the FDAs pre-existing regulatory interpretation, to require that a drug sponsor demonstrate the clinical superiority of an orphan drug that is otherwise the same as a previously approved drug for the same rare disease in order to receive orphan drug exclusivity. The new legislation reverses prior precedent holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously requires that the FDA recognize the orphan exclusivity period regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. The FDA may further reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act, including the FDARA amendment, its regulations and policies. We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA may make to its orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted. 
 Pediatric exclusivity, pediatric use and rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers 
 Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain product candidates may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA (a Written Request) relating to the use of the active moiety of the product candidate in children. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a product candidate in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population. 
 FDARA amended the FDCA to provide that a drug, for which an application has been submitted or approved pursuant to section 505(b)(2) or 505(j) of the FDCA, will not be considered ineligible for approval or misbranded because the labeling of such drug omits a pediatric indication or other pediatric labeling information when the omitted pediatric information is protected by patent or marketing exclusivity. FDARA further permits FDA to require specific labeling for such products related to the omitted pediatric indication and information to, among other things, make clear that the omission of the information is related to the exclusivity. We do not know if or how such changes to the pediatric exclusivity provisions might affect our business. 
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most product candidates and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, biologics license applications and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product candidate or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. After April 2013, the FDA must send a noncompliance letter to any sponsor that fails to 
 
28 


  submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s). 
 Section 529 of the FDCA is intended to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain rare pediatric diseases. Although there are existing incentive programs to encourage the development and study of drugs for rare diseases, pediatric populations, and unmet medical needs, section 529 provides an additional incentive for rare pediatric diseases, which may be used alone or in combination with other incentive programs. Rare pediatric disease is defined as a disease that: 
 

 | primarily affects individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents, which is interpreted as meaning that greater than 50% of the affected population in the U.S. is aged 0 through 18 years; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | is a rare disease or condition as defined in the FDCA, which includes diseases and conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 persons in the U.S. and diseases and conditions that affect a larger number of persons and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the costs of developing and making available the drug in the U.S. can be recovered from sales of the drug in the U.S.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under section 529, the sponsor of a human drug application for a rare pediatric disease drug product may be eligible for a voucher that can be used (or sold) to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug application submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act after the date of approval of the rare pediatric disease drug product. The rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers program was re-authorized by Congress in the Cures Act, extending the program through 2020. The FDA has issued draft Guidance for Industry for Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Vouchers. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product candidate reaches the market. Requirements for additional Phase 4 trials (post-approval marketing studies) to confirm safety and efficacy may be imposed as a condition of approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product candidate may result in REMS or even complete withdrawal of the product candidate from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product candidate, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling changes, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved product candidates that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product candidate based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 
 Any product candidates manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things: 
 

 | record-keeping requirements;
--+-----------------------------


 | reporting of adverse experiences with the product candidate;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission of periodic reports;
--+--------------------------------


 | providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | drug sampling, stability and distribution requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


 | notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | complying with statutory and regulatory requirements for promotion and advertising.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved product candidates are required to register their establishments and provide product listing information to the FDA and

  certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. 
 Regulation outside of the U.S. 
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to regulations of other jurisdictions governing any clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries, and approval of the regulators of such countries or supranational areas, such as the European Union (EU), before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
 Under EU regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for certain medicines, including those produced by biotechnology or those intended to treat HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases or diabetes and is optional for those medicines which are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. Through the decentralized procedure, a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in the EU can be simultaneously authorized in several EU member states. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment reports, each member state must decide whether to recognize the approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 
 As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. Sponsors of orphan drugs in the EU can enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication. During such period, marketing authorization applications for similar medicinal products will not be accepted, unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. In the EU, a similar medicinal product is a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in a currently authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered and paid for by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. For example, the current U.S. administration has indicated support for possible new measures to regulate drug pricing. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could significantly limit our net revenue and financial results. If these third-party payors

  do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has had a significant impact on the health care industry by, for example, expanding coverage for the uninsured and seeking to contain overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products such as expanding and increasing industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and making changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. Recently, the current U.S. administration and U.S. Congress have expressed a desire to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA, which has contributed to the uncertainty of the ongoing implementation and impact of the ACA and also underscores the potential for additional health care reform going forward. For example, the newly enacted federal income tax law includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. Congress may consider other legislation that would alter other aspects of the ACA. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact the current U.S. administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates. 
 Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislations automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, on February 9, 2018, Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act that made a number of healthcare reforms. For example, the law changes the discounts manufacturers are required to apply to their drugs under the Coverage Gap Discount Program from 50% to 70% of the negotiated price starting in 2019. In addition, the law increases civil and criminal penalties for fraud and abuse laws, including, for example, criminal fines for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute increase from $25,000 to $100,000 and corresponding prison sentences also increase from no more than five years to no more than ten years.

 Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. For example, in September 2017, the California State Assembly approved SB17 which requires pharmaceutical companies to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before any scheduled increases in the prices of their products if they exceed 16% over a two-year period, and further requiring pharmaceutical companies to explain the reasons for such increase. Effective in 2016, Vermont passed a law requiring certain manufacturer identified by the state to justify their price increases. 
 In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls and/or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, product candidates launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to have price structures that are significantly lower. 
 Other Healthcare Fraud and Laws 
 In the U.S., our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (such as the Office of Inspector General and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ) and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti- Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (the FCA) (discussed below). 
 
32 


 The federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes any request or demand for money or property presented to the U.S. government. For instance, historically, pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies marketing of the product for unapproved, off-label, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses. 
 HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Additionally, to the extent that our product candidates may in the future be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws. 
 We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAAs privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors, or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 We expect our product candidates, once approved, may be eligible for coverage under Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiarys health condition. In addition, our product candidates may be covered and reimbursed under other government programs, such as Medicaid and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturers outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program. As part of the requirements to participate in certain government programs, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average manufacturer price, or AMP, and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. 
 
33 


 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the Sunshine Act), within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to report accurately could result in penalties. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts. 
 Environment 
 Our third-party manufacturers are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal, state and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations. We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations. 
Sales and Marketing 
 Our current focus is on the development of our existing portfolio, the initiation and completion of clinical trials and, if and where appropriate, the registration of our product candidates. We currently do not have marketing, sales and distribution capabilities. If we receive marketing and commercialization approval for any of our product candidates, we intend to market the product either directly or through strategic alliances and distribution agreements with third parties. The ultimate implementation of our strategy for realizing the financial value of our product candidates is dependent on the results of clinical trials for our product candidates, the availability of funds, our ability to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement of our products, compliance with laws governing our sales and marketing activities, and the ability to negotiate acceptable commercial terms with third parties. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 44 full-time employees, of whom 32 are engaged in research and development and 12 in administration. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Geographically, 39 of our employees are located in Massachusetts, four in Colorado and one in New Jersey. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
