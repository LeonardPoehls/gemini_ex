COMPANY OVERVIEW
 
Green Hygienics Holdings Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 12, 2008 as Silver Bay Resources Inc. and issued 55,000 shares of common stock on June 12, 2008 (after accounting for the forward and reverse splits detailed below) for cash of $20,000.   On June 30, 2010 the Company changed its name to Takedown Entertainment Inc and forward split its issued shares on the basis of five new shares for one old share (5:1) on the same date.
 
On July 24, 2012 the Company changed its name to Green Hygienics Holdings Inc. and, on the same date, reverse split both its issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a two thousand old for one new basis (1:2,000). On June 2, 2005, the company completed a reverse split on its issued shares of common stock on the basis of two hundred old for one new basis (1:200).
 
During 2008 the Company staked one mineral claim located 100 km northwest of Vancouver, British Columbia and acquired a molybdenum property comprised of one mineral claim located approximately 35 kilometers north of Vancouver, British Columbia. We did not proceed with further exploration of the mineral claims due to a determination that the results of our initial geological program did not generate investor interest in the claims and we were unable to finance further exploration. Mineral property costs of $20,000 were expensed during 2009. Both properties have since been abandoned by the Company.
 
During the years 2009 to June 3, 2015 the Company was involved in the acquisition, production, licensing, marketing and distribution of mixed martial arts (MMA) content, programming and merchandising for North American and International markets. The Company was negotiating to transfer to the former President of the Company all of its rights to and interests in its mixed martial arts program (Takedown), including any and all Takedown assets, in return for the forgiveness of a liability of $29,812 owing to the former President of the Company.
 
On April 16, 2015, Wilderness Custom Exteriors Ltd., a construction company from Kelowna, British Columbia, specializing in the construction of marijuana growing operations, acquired the $189,150 Promissory Note from Mr. David Harris, and acquired the $145,000 Promissory Note from Zircon Ventures Inc. (hereinafter collectively referred to as the Notes.) On June 2, 2015, the Company received instructions from Wilderness Custom Exteriors Ltd. to accept as payment in full of the Notes including accrued interest, by issuing 30,000,000 shares of common stock. On June 3, 2015, the Company issued 15,000,000 shares of common stock to Wilderness Custom Exteriors Ltd. and 15,000,000 shares of common stock to Richard Powell, a businessman located in Kelowna, British Columbia.
  
On June 3, 2015, through the expertise of its new management, Mr. Rick Powell and Mr. Jim Loseth, we entered into the commercial indoor cultivation business specializing in the construction of cannabis growing facilities and the management thereof. Currently, we are planning to obtain contracts to build marijuana growing operations for third parties.
 
We build pre-fabricated buildings which meet new mandatory fire and energy codes with structural products that are fire, rot, mold, and termite resistant. Our, pre-fabricated Green Hygienics material render the electrical, mechanical and HVAC engineering and installation more efficiently than conventional construction methods. This reduces the initial set up cost and time. Utilizing a sterile growing environment increases the likelihood of meeting requisite quality assurance standards. We use a soilless, scalable, production system. This provides the low running costs and high yielding required to produce the both quality of product, but volume consistently, while maintaining the possible lowest carbon footprint.
 
We had $2,966 in cash reserves as of the year ended July 31, 2015. We anticipate that we will incur $50,000 for administrative expenses, including professional legal and accounting expenses associated with compliance with our periodic reporting requirements over the next twelve months, and approximately $100,000 per month ($1,200,000) to provide the funds necessary to bring to market our proprietary methods of facility construction and management. 
 
We are contemplating raising additional capital to finance our business operations. No final decisions regarding financing have been made at this time. It is anticipated that funding for the Company will come from one or more of the following means: engaging in an offering of our stock; engaging in borrowing; locating a joint venture partner or partners.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
During the years 2009 to June 3, 2015 the Company was involved in the acquisition, production, licensing, marketing and distribution of mixed martial arts (MMA) content, programming and merchandising for North American and International markets. The Company was never able to close asset acquisition agreements due to a lack of funding. As a result, we have no customers or consumers of our products, we have no principal suppliers or sources for materials. There is no need for government approval of our products and services.
  
On June 3, 2015, through the expertise of its new management, we entered into the commercial indoor cultivation industry. Currently, we are seeking contracts to build marijuana growing operations. In the cannabis agri-business in which the Company has entered, we face competition from other existing companies in all aspects of our business. Many of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources than we have. Factors that affect our ability to build and manage the indoor cultivation industry include available funds, lack of a direct history of providing these services, and our limited number of employees.
 
British Columbia has been a leader in indoor cultivation since the 1980s. There are three distinct methods of growing indoors:
 
 
· | Peat based soil mixtures for roots are best for nurseries for flowers and shrubs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Hydroponics, where the root systems are immersed in water, are best for wet weight produce such as tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Aeroponics, where the roots hang in the air (in a chamber) and are misted by way of high pressure pumps, are best for dry weight products such as leafy greens, herbs, and cannabis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



All mediums for growing crops strive to deliver water, balance nutrients, and oxygen to their plant.  Indoor systems offer the grower more control of the environment. Most cannabis growing operations have their root systems based either in soil or in water.
 
The reasons for this is that it is the capital expenditures to set up such systems indoors is far less expensive than building an aeroponics based system. Also the management skills required to manage such non-aeroponics based systems is minimal.
 
We are experts in using aeroponics. Unlike any other system, aeroponics provides a completely controlled environment. Our proprietary growing system provides direct feed to the aeroponics based root system, it provides an enclosed air system for the entire plant. A centralized monitoring system ensures optimal temperature and ideal nutrients are delivered continually and consistently to the plants. This results in optimal growing conditions, superior quality, and superior yields. Our management system is designed to train employees to monitor the system to ensure continued optimality.
 
Although aeroponic technology was developed in the 1930s, world-wide more and more large-scale urban crop production are now being cultivated through this technology. As the aeroponics provides a controlled environment which encompass the following:
 
 
· | a consistent cannabis crop;
--+----------------------------


· | intelligent growth lights and natural light;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | air filtration and circulation systems for controlling heat buildup (from the lights) and eliminate exhaust odors
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | aeroponic designed to ensure both water, oxygen, and nutrient management systems; and a computer control systems to which provide ideal levels of nutrients, lights, air circulation, oxygen, and moisture requirements at all times. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Advantages of the aeroponics systems are:
 
 
· | Faster growth
--+--------------


· | Higher yields
--+--------------


· | Better quality.
--+----------------


· | Reduced labor cost
--+-------------------


· | Reduced risk of disease and pests
--+----------------------------------

MARKETS AND CUSTOMERS
 
Our market and our potential customers are third party companies which wish to invest in cannabis growing operations. Currently, there are approximately 30 licensed growers of dried and fresh cannabis in Canada, each is a prospective client. In the United States, as of November 12, 2014, there were 22 states and the District of Columbia which allowed its residents to use medical marijuana. Additionally, voters in the states of Colorado, Alaska, Oregon and Washington approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for adult use. The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level.
 
Regardless of this, according to a report obtained by The Huffington Post, legalized marijuana use is the fastest-growth industry in the United States and if the trend towards legalization spreads to all 50 states, marijuana could become larger than the organic food industry. Researchers from the ArcView Group, a cannabis industry investment and research firm based in Oakland, California, found that the U.S. market for legal cannabis grew 74% in 2014 to $2.7 billion, up from $1.5 billion in 2013.
 
The group surveyed hundreds of medical and recreational marijuana retailers in states where sales are legal, as well as ancillary business operators and independent cultivators of the plant, over the course of seven months during 2013 and 2014. ArcView also compiled data from state agencies, non-profit organizations and private companies for a more complete look at the marketplace. According to the executive summary of the third edition of the State of Legal Marijuana Markets, the CEO stated that “in the last year, the rise of the cannabis industry went from an interesting cocktail conversation to being taken seriously as the fastest growing industry in America. At this point, it’s hard to imagine that any serious businessperson who is paying attention hasn’t spent some time thinking about the possibilities in the market”.
 
We strongly believe that low cost, high quality producers of cannabis which utilize the aeroponics growing methods will be the ultimate winners and the only survivors as cannabis production, marketing, and consumption become mainstream over the next decade.
 
COMPETITION
 
Although the construction industry is highly competitive, there are no contractors experienced in building aeroponic facilities in the Pacific Northwest. We have over 25 years’ experience building and managing aeroponic based systems.
 
But the construction industry is highly competitive by nature, consequently, several facilities may be built using less than optimal plans. It is our belief that because these building are not built to the highest specifications that the underlying operations will fail. It is our belief that our proprietary designs utilizing aeroponics, will result in the highest quality, the greatest efficiency, and the least cost.
 
REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS
 
With respect to our proposed entry to the cannabis growing industry, should the federal government legalize marijuana for medical use in the United States, it is possible that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would seek to regulate it under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act of 1938. Additionally, the FDA may issue rules and regulations including CGMPs (certified good manufacturing practices) related to the growth, cultivation, harvesting and processing of medical marijuana. Clinical trials may be needed to verify efficacy and safety. It is also possible that the FDA would require that facilities where medical marijuana is grown be registered with the FDA and comply with certain federally prescribed regulations. In the event that some or all of these regulations are imposed, we do not know what the impact would be on the medical marijuana industry, what costs, requirements and possible prohibitions may be enforced. If we or our tenants are unable to comply with the regulations and or registration as prescribed by the FDA, we and/or our tenants may be unable to continue to operate their and our business in its current form or at all.
