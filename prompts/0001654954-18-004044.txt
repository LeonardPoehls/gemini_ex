 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  Corporate History
  
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 5, 2007. Effective June 15, 2011, we completed a merger with our subsidiary, Titan Iron Ore Corp., a Nevada corporation, which was incorporated solely to effect a change in our name to “Titan Iron Ore Corp.”
  
 As of December 31, 2013, Titan Iron Ore Corp. was a mineral exploration company. Due to our inability to raise capital to further develop mining claims and pursue mineral exploration, we decided to exit the mining business and look for other opportunities.
  
 On February 3, 2014, we completed a merger with iHookup Social, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“iHookup”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) dated January 31, 2014. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we incorporated a new subsidiary called iHookup Operations Corp, a Delaware corporation, which merged with and into iHookup, causing the subsidiary’s separate existence to cease and iHookup to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. iHookup’s stockholders exchanged all of their twelve million (12,000,000) shares of outstanding common stock for fifty million (50,000,000) shares of the Company’s newly designated Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of common stock entitles its holder to one vote on each matter submitted to the stockholders.  The holders of preferred stock are entitled to cast votes equal to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of common stock into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible. The total aggregate issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock at any given time regardless of their number shall be convertible into the number of shares of common stock which equals nine (9) times the total number of shares of common stock which are issued and outstanding at the time of any conversion, at the option of the preferred holders or until the closing of a Qualified Financing (i.e. the sale and issuance of our equity securities that results in gross proceeds in excess of $2,500,000) at one time or in the same round. As a result of the transaction, the former Friendable stockholders received a controlling interest in the Company due to the voting rights of the Series A Preferred Stock being connected to their super-majority conversion rights.
  
 On April 29, 2014, FINRA approved a 20 for 1 reverse stock split whereby 937,459,274 shares of the Company’s common stock then issued and outstanding, were exchanged for 46,872,964 shares of the Company’s common stock.
  
 On March 19, 2015, FINRA approved a 100 for 1 reverse stock split whereby 2,355,489,991, shares of the Company’s common stock then issued and outstanding, were exchanged for 23,554,923 shares of the Company’s common stock.
  
 On October 26, 2015, the Company issued a press release announcing that FINRA had approved a change to our trading symbol for our common stock which is quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace. Effective October 27, 2015 our trading symbol was changed from “HKUP” to “FDBL”. This change was made in conjunction with the Company’s filing of a Certificate of Amendment on September 28, 2015 to its Articles of Incorporation changing the name of the Company from “iHookup Social, Inc.” to “Friendable, Inc.” The company had previously announced a re-branding our app from "iHookup Social" to "Friendable". As a result, the Company desired to change its name to match the rebranding so as to be more specific to the Company’s core values and its products/services, creating a more recognizable brand that creates less confusion.
 
 On May 31, 2017, the Company filed an Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation increasing the authorized common stock from 10,000,000,000 to 15,000,000,000 shares. On June 28, 2017, the Company incorporated a subsidiary, Fan Pass Inc., a Nevada corporation, which was incorporated to undertake the development of the mobile application “The Fan Pass App”.
 
 
  Who We Are
 
 The Company is a mobile-social technology company focused on connecting and engaging users through its existing social networking app “Friendable” and a new application scheduled to roll out in 2018, Fan Pass.
 
 The Company’s first product was launched under the same name as the Company, the Friendable app. The app provides a mobile social network for both iOS and Android mobile devices/operating systems and allows users to create one-on-one or group-style meet-ups for food, drinks, live music venues, or any other occasion, based on location. Since its inception in 2013, Friendable has generated more than 1 million downloads, 800,000 registered users, and approximately 600,000 user profiles, and has been featured in popular music videos such as the 2016 hit “Ain’t Your Mama” by singer Jennifer Lopez. The Company seeks to explore new opportunities for growth, partnerships, mergers or acquisitions in 2018.

 In 2018, the Company intends to release a beta version of its Fan Pass mobile application for user testing as well as complete a version of Fan Pass ready for commercial release. Additionally, Fan Pass is its own Corporation that is currently wholly owned by Friendable, Inc., and on a path to be spun off as a separate entity. The spin-off of Fan Pass, Inc. is intended to result in a share issuance to all Friendable shareholders as the Company files an S1 registration statement to become a stand-alone public company.
  
 
 The Fan Pass app has been designed to capture and monetize content via live streaming video. Video content will be the focus in which the Company will build content related assets and allow brands/social media influencers to unite. The app has the opportunity to provide fans to capture and/or view exclusive back-stage and uncensored video content from their favorite performing artists and celebrities (social media influencers). Fan Pass is currently working on its application, as well as establishing partnerships with some of the very same and prominent artists utilized by Friendable in the past. These artists include Jennifer Lopez, Austin Mahone, Meghan Trainor, Fetty Wap, and more. Through these previous celebrity partnerships, Fan Pass believes it can drive downloads and convert downloads to users, this approach allows Fan Pass to leverage built-in fan bases into the application’s initial viewership base, making quick and large scalability a real possibility.
 
 
  Mobile Applications
  
  Introduction
  
  The Friendable Mobile Application:
  
 
  Friendable is a "friends-first" approach to making new connections. Unlike platforms like Facebook and Instagram where users post what they did in the past, Friendable’s features are designed and focused on living in the present and looking forward to the future:
 
   ■
 Friendable is a mobile application where users can create meet-up events that can be shared to one person or multiple individuals.

   ■
 Users can select which type of event they would like to create or attend, separated by categories like “Food,” “Movies,” and more.

   ■
 Users with similar interests and locations will be matched together, and will then be able to chat with one another to coordinate a meet-up time and place.

   ■
 Users can look up current events and send gifts to other users.

   ■
 Users can friend other users to meet-up again, creating a social network of goers and adventurers.

 

 As of April 2018, Friendable has been downloaded over 1 million times across iOS and Android.

  “Everything Starts with Friendship.”
 
 Management believes that its Friendable app and brand, along with its existing feature set is in need of upgrades, expansion and more intelligent technology integration to stay competitive in the Social Networking category. With such upgrades being extremely costly and the existing user base growing only through search and organic word of mouth, Friendable intends to seek strategic partners that may provide new opportunities to create value for the Company’s shareholders by pivoting the app or its business focus in a new direction.

The Fan Pass Live Application (Development Project) Fan Pass will be an online, mobile-based, video application that the Company believes will empower the end user by attracting brands, social influencers, artists, musicians and celebrities to build a significant content base and then deliver live, exclusive video content to their fan bases/app users. The app is to be available on both iOS and Android operating systems. Examples of content may include: ■ Branded Backstage access before, during or after an event ■ Recording studio sessions ■ Behind-the-scenes looks on music video, film, or photoshoot sets ■ On-set makeup or wardrobe trailers ■ Special interviews or one-on-one video sessions with celebrities ■ Daily looks into the lives of celebrities, artists, and stars ■ …and more VIP exclusive content In addition, fans will be able to chat with other fans before, during, and after the live stream; view older, archived live videos; and subscribe to an individual broadcast instead of a channel. We believe that, especially for a large event like a music festival or concert, the option for fans to briefly purchase a broadcast or view an older broadcast increases the likelihood of added subscriptions.

 For artists, Fan Pass will offer several levels of revenue-sharing with them and their agencies. Each artist will be asked to market their Fan Pass channel to their social followers and fans, ultimately generating subscription revenue for the Company. The revenue-sharing ecosystem is designed to help celebrities monetize their fans and followers at fairer rates compared to other video streaming applications; Fan Pass will be able to be used in conjunction with other video applications to bolster their income. Lastly, Fan Pass will offer video production and recording services for artists if they do not want to record their own streams.
 
  “Empowering users, influencers and artists everywhere to deliver live, exclusive video content.”
  
  Marketing
  
 We intend to market our applications utilizing a variety of online and offline marketing activities, brand partnerships and social influencers that can spread the word far and wide.
  
 The Company believes various marketing initiatives will combine celebrity driven outreach to social media followers and fans, specialized content, digital marketing, and live event marketing to optimize market reach.
 
  Celebrity Marketing: Celebrity partners intend to utilize social media, music videos, live events and existing fan marketing to market Fan Pass Live and Friendable app.
 
  Event Marketing: Marketing / business development teams will market the application at live events around music video releases, concerts, private events, promotional events, and other festivities. In addition, video and photography crews will take pictures and videos at events for public relations and social media.
 
  Digital Marketing: The Company intends to utilize digital marketing avenues such as: celebrity direct-to-fan; digital ad campaigns on social media and search engines; search engine optimization; and other digital marketing initiatives that will utilize celebrity and user generated content for maximum market reach.
 
 The Company also intends to utilize online marketing channels such as Google and social media marketing, display advertising, and online publications. The Company will continually track cost of user acquisition, the lifetime value of each customer, and ROI of all marketing expenditures to reduce expenses and increase overall profit margins.
 
 The creation of a business development team that will curate the Company’s internal and external growth goals, and traditional forms of advertising such as television and radio are also key avenues. The goal of using these channels is to create a platform for the long-term success and brand awareness, a matrix of the Company’s planned marketing channels is listed below:
