Item 1. Business 
Overview
We are the world’s leading aluminum rolled products producer, based on shipment volume of 3,067 kt in fiscal 2017. We are also the global leader in the recycling of aluminum. We are the only known company of our size and scope focused solely on aluminum rolled products markets and capable of local supply of technologically sophisticated aluminum products in all four major industrialized continents: North America, South America, Europe and Asia. We had “Net sales” of $10 billion for the year ended March 31, 2017.
Our History
Organization and Description of Business
All of the common shares of Novelis are owned directly by AV Metals Inc. and indirectly by Hindalco Industries Limited. We produce aluminum sheet and light gauge products primarily for use in the beverage can, automotive, specialty products (including consumer electronics, architecture, and other transportation) and foil markets. We also have recycling operations in many of our plants to recycle aluminum. As of March 31, 2017, we had manufacturing operations in ten countries on four continents: North America, South America, Europe and Asia, through 24 operating facilities, including recycling operations in eleven of these plants. 
Our Industry
The aluminum rolled products market represents the global supply of, and demand for, aluminum sheet, plate and foil produced either from sheet ingot or continuously cast roll-stock in rolling mills operated by both independent aluminum rolled products producers and integrated aluminum companies.
Aluminum rolled products are semi-finished aluminum products that constitute the raw material for the manufacture of finished goods ranging from automotive structures and body panels to food and beverage cans. There are two major types of manufacturing processes for aluminum rolled products differing mainly in the process used to achieve the initial stage of processing:

• | hot mills — which require sheet ingot, a rectangular slab of aluminum, as starter material; and


• | continuous casting mills — which can convert molten metal directly into semi-finished sheet.

 Both processes require subsequent rolling, which we refer to as cold rolling, and finishing steps such as annealing, coating, leveling or slitting to achieve the desired thickness, width and metal properties. Most customers receive shipments in the form of aluminum coil, a large roll of metal, which can be utilized in their fabrication processes.
Industry Sources of Metal
There are two sources of input material: (1) recycled aluminum, produced by remelting post-industrial and post-consumer scraps; and (2) primary aluminum, produced from bauxite processed in a smelter.
Primary aluminum and sheet ingot can generally be purchased at prices set on the LME, plus a local market premium that varies by geographic region of delivery, alloying material, form (ingot or molten metal) and purity. 
Recycled aluminum is generally purchased at a discount compared to the price of primary aluminum depending on type and quality of the scrap, geographic region, and other market factors. 
Industry End-use Markets
Aluminum rolled products companies produce and sell a wide range of products, which can be grouped into five end-use markets: (1) packaging; (2) transportation; (3) architectural; (4) industrial; and (5) consumer durables and other. Within each end-use market, aluminum rolled products are manufactured with a variety of alloy mixtures; a range of tempers (hardness), gauges (thickness) and widths; and various coatings and finishes. Large customers typically have customized needs resulting in the development of close relationships, including technical development relationships, with their supplying mills.
Aluminum, because of its light weight, recyclability and formability, has a wide variety of uses in packaging and other end-use markets. The recyclability of aluminum enables it to be used, collected, melted and returned to the original product form an unlimited number of times, unlike paper and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic, which deteriorate with every iteration of recycling.

Packaging. Aluminum is used in beverage cans and bottles, food cans, beverage screw caps and foil, among others. Packaging is the largest aluminum rolled products application, according to market data from Commodity Research Unit International Limited (CRU), an independent business analysis and consultancy group. Beverage cans are one of the largest aluminum rolled products applications. In addition to their recyclability, aluminum beverage cans offer advantages in fabricating efficiency and product shelf life. Fabricators are able to produce and fill beverage cans at very high speeds, and non-porous aluminum cans provide longer shelf life than PET plastic containers. Additionally, the use of aluminum to package beverages such as craft beer is increasing, as aluminum blocks sunlight and therefore maintains the quality and taste of the product longer. Aluminum cans are light, stackable and use space efficiently, making them convenient and cost-efficient to ship.
Beverage can sheet is sold in coil form for the production of can bodies, ends and tabs. The material can be ordered as rolled, degreased, pre-lubricated, pre-treated and/or lacquered. Typically, can makers define their own specifications for material to be delivered in terms of alloy, gauge, width and surface finish.
Foil wrap or packaging foil is another packaging application and it includes household and institutional aluminum foil. Container foil is used to produce semi-rigid containers such as pie plates and take-out food trays.
Transportation. Aluminum rolled products are used in vehicle structures (also known as "body-in-white") as well as automotive body panel applications, including hoods, deck lids, fenders and lift gates. These uses typically result from cooperative efforts between aluminum rolled products manufacturers and their customers that yield solutions for specific requirements in alloy selection, fabrication procedure, surface quality and joining. There has been recent growth in certain geographic markets in passenger and commercial vehicle applications due to the lighter weight, better fuel economy and improved emissions performance associated with these applications. We expect increased growth in this end-use market driven by government regulations requiring improved emissions and better fuel economy; while also maintaining or improving vehicle performance and safety.
Heat exchangers, such as radiators and air conditioners, are an important application for aluminum rolled products in the transportation end-use market. Original equipment manufacturers also use aluminum sheet with specially treated surfaces and other specific properties for interior and exterior applications. Newly developed alloys are being used in transportation tanks and rigid containers allowing for safer and more economical transportation of hazardous and corrosive materials.
Aluminum is also used in aerospace applications, as well as in the construction of ships’ hulls, superstructures and passenger rail cars because of its strength, light weight, formability and corrosion resistance.
Architectural. Construction is the largest application within this end-use market. Aluminum rolled products developed for the construction industry are often decorative and non-flammable, offer insulating properties, are durable and corrosion resistant, and have a high strength-to-weight ratio. Aluminum siding, gutters, and downspouts comprise a significant amount of construction volume. Other applications include doors, windows, awnings, canopies, facades, roofs and ceilings.
Industrial. Industrial applications include heat exchangers, process and electrical machinery, lighting fixtures, furniture and insulation. 
Consumer Durables and Other. Aluminum’s lightweight characteristics, high formability, ability to conduct electricity and dissipate heat and its corrosion resistance makes it useful in a wide variety of electronic applications. Uses of aluminum rolled products in electronics include flat screen televisions, personal computers, laptops, mobile devices, and digital music players. Other uses of aluminum rolled products in consumer durables include microwaves, coffee makers, air conditioners and cooking utensils.

The factors influencing competition vary by region and end-use market, but generally we compete on the basis of our value proposition; which includes price, product quality, the ability to meet customers’ specifications, range of products offered, lead times, technical support and customer service. In some end-use markets, competition is also affected by fabricators’ requirements that suppliers complete a qualification process to supply their plants. This process can be rigorous and may take many months to complete. As a result, obtaining business from these customers can be a lengthy and expensive process. However, the ability to obtain and maintain these qualifications can represent a competitive advantage.
In addition to competition from others within the aluminum rolled products industry, we also face competition from non-aluminum material producers. In the packaging end-use market (primarily beverage and food cans), aluminum rolled products compete mainly with glass, PET plastic, and in some regions, steel. In the transportation end-use market, aluminum rolled products compete mainly with steel and composites. Aluminum competes with wood, plastic, cement and steel in building products applications. In the consumer durables end-use market, aluminum rolled products compete mainly with plastic, steel, and magnesium. Additionally, aluminum competes with steel, cooper, plastic, and glass in industrial applications. Factors affecting competition with substitute materials include price, ease to manufacture, consumer preference and performance characteristics.

Key Factors Affecting Supply and Demand
The following factors have historically affected the supply of aluminum rolled products:
Production Capacity and Alternative Technology. The addition of rolling capacity requires large capital investments and significant plant construction or expansion, and typically requires long lead-time equipment orders. Advances in technological capabilities allow aluminum rolled products producers to better align product portfolios and supply with industry demand. There are lower cost ways to enter the industry such as continuous casting, which offers the ability to increase capacity in smaller increments than is possible with hot mill additions; however, the continuous casting process results in a more limited range of products.
Trade. Some trade flows occur between regions despite shipping costs, import duties and the lack of localized customer support. Higher value-added products are more likely to be traded internationally, especially if demand in certain markets exceeds local supply. With respect to less technically demanding applications, emerging markets with low cost inputs may export commodity aluminum rolled products to larger, more mature markets, as we have seen with China.
The following factors have historically affected the demand for aluminum rolled products:
Economic Growth. We believe that economic growth is a significant driver of aluminum rolled products demand. In mature markets, growth in demand has typically correlated closely with industrial production growth. In many emerging markets, growth in demand typically exceeds industrial production growth largely because of expanding infrastructures, capital investments and rising incomes that often accompany economic growth in these markets.
Substitution Trends. Manufacturers’ willingness to substitute other materials for aluminum in their products and competition from substitution materials suppliers also affect demand. There has been a strong substitution trend toward aluminum in the use of vehicles as automobile manufacturers look for ways to meet fuel efficiency regulations, improve performance and reduce carbon emissions in a cost-efficient manner. As a result of aluminum’s durability, strength and light weight, automobile manufacturers are substituting heavier alternatives such as steel and iron with aluminum. Carbon fiber is another lightweight material option, but its relatively high cost and limited end-of-life recyclability reduce its competitiveness as a widespread material substitute today. Consequently, demand for flat rolled aluminum products has increased. We also see strong substitution trends toward aluminum and away from steel in the beverage can market in certain regions. 
Seasonality. During our third fiscal quarter, we typically experience seasonal slowdowns resulting in lower shipment volumes. This is a result of declines in overall production output due primarily to holidays and cooler weather in North America and Europe, our two largest operating regions.  We also experience downtime at our mills and customers’ mills due to scheduled plant maintenance and are impacted to a lesser extent by the seasonal downturn in construction activity.
Sustainability. Growing awareness of environmentalism and demand for recyclable products has increased the demand for aluminum rolled products. Unlike other commonly recycled materials such as paper or PET plastic, aluminum can be infinitely recycled without affecting the quality of the product. Additionally, the recycling process uses 95% less energy than is required to produce primary aluminum from mining and smelting, with an equivalent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
Our Business Strategy
Following the successful completion of significant multi-year capital investments to increase our capacity, reshape our product portfolio and expand our recycling capacity, our primary objective as the world’s largest aluminum rolling and recycling company is to increase shareholder value by delivering best in class customer service and high-quality, innovative solutions. In addition, we will maximize shareholder value through free cash flow generation and increasing return on capital employed. We intend to achieve these objectives through the following areas of focus:
Focus on Manufacturing Excellence
We are driving our business forward by focusing on manufacturing excellence. This includes a commitment to employee safety, customer service, product quality and system reliability. 
As a manufacturing organization, our primary concern is the health and safety of our employees. We are committed to building a culture of safety across all levels of the organization. We are focused on optimizing our manufacturing and recycling operations to increase asset utilization and productivity. We continue to pursue a standardization of our manufacturing processes where possible; while still allowing the flexibility to respond to local market demands. We are focused on maintaining a competitive cost structure by managing metal inputs and employing initiatives to improve operational efficiencies across our plants globally. 
Our customers demand consistent, high-quality products. We are committed to producing the best quality products and providing reliable on-time delivery and be a true partner in innovation and sustainable supply solutions. We are focused on building and maintaining strong, positive relationships with all of our customers.

Operate as an Integrated Global Company
We intend to continue operating as a globally integrated company to leverage our manufacturing excellence, risk management expertise, value-added conversion premium-based pricing and global assets according to a single, company-wide vision. We believe this integrated approach is the foundation for the effective execution of our strategy across the Novelis system.
We strive to service our customers in a consistent, global manner through seamless alignment of goals, methods and metrics across the organization, while still allowing for local flexibility.
Focus on Premium Products
We focus on capturing global growth in beverage can, automotive and specialty products markets. Our management approach helps us to systematically identify opportunities to improve the profitability of our operations through product portfolio analysis. This ensures that we grow in attractive market segments, while also taking actions to exit unattractive ones. We will continue to focus on these core products to drive enhanced profitability. In the recent past, we have taken steps to exit certain non-core operations, including aluminum smelting operations and hydroelectric facilities in Brazil, and consumer foil operations in North America and Europe. 
Over the past several years, we invested in world-class assets and technical capabilities to position ourselves to meet increasing global demand for aluminum from the automotive market. We now have automotive finishing lines in North America, Europe, and Asia. Additionally, we believe there are opportunities to capture growth in other areas (e.g., beverage cans) driven by metal substitution and urbanization trends in emerging markets such as South America.
Utilize Recycled Metal Inputs
Utilizing recycled material allows us to diversify our metal supply, helps to control metal costs and provides environmental benefits. Since fiscal year 2011, our recycled inputs have increased from 33% to 55% in fiscal year 2017. 
Novelis is working closely with our customers on innovation to drive more sustainable products for society. Novelis is the only company of its size offering independently certified, high-recycled content aluminum sheet for our beverage and specialty product customers. We are also working closely with our automotive customers to redesign automotive alloys to be made with more recycled inputs, as well as seeking to purchase the aluminum scrap resulting from our automotive customers’ production processes.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
The input materials we use in manufacturing include primary aluminum, recycled aluminum, sheet ingot, alloying elements and grain refiners. These raw materials are generally available from several sources and are not generally subject to supply constraints in normal market conditions. We also consume considerable amounts of energy in the operation of our facilities.
Aluminum
We obtain aluminum from a number of sources, including the following:
Primary Aluminum Sourcing. We purchased or tolled approximately 1,490 kt of primary aluminum in fiscal 2017 in the form of sheet ingot, standard ingot and molten metal, approximately 21% of which we purchased from RT.
Aluminum Products Recycling. We operate facilities in several plants to recycle post-consumer aluminum, such as UBCs collected through recycling programs. In addition, we have agreements with several of our large customers where we have a closed-looped system whereby we take production scrap material from their fabricating activity and re-melt, cast and roll it to re-supply these customers with aluminum sheet. Other sources of recycled material include lithographic plates, and products with longer lifespans, like vehicles and buildings, which are starting to become high volume sources of recycled material. We purchased or tolled approximately 1,700 kt of recycled material inputs in fiscal 2017 and have made recycling investments in all of our operating regions to increase the amount of recycled material we use as raw materials.
The materials that we recycle are remelted, cast and then used in our operations. The net effect of all recycling activities was that on average approximately 55% of our total aluminum rolled products shipments in fiscal 2017 were made from recycled inputs. The overall benefit we receive from utilizing recycled metal is influenced by: 1) the overall price levels of the LME and local market premiums, 2) the spread between the price for recycled aluminum and the LME primary aluminum price and 3) our consumption levels of the recycled material inputs.

Our recycled content performance and methodology are detailed in our annual sustainability report, which can be found at www.novelis.com/sustainability. Information in our sustainability report does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Energy
We use several sources of energy in the manufacture and delivery of our aluminum rolled products. In fiscal 2017, natural gas and electricity represented approximately 98% of our energy consumption by cost. We also use fuel oil and transport fuel. The majority of energy usage occurs at our casting centers and during the hot rolling process. Our cold rolling facilities require relatively less energy. We purchase our natural gas on the open market, which subjects us to market pricing fluctuations. We have in the past and may continue to seek to stabilize our future exposure to natural gas prices through the use of derivative instruments. Natural gas prices in Europe and South America have historically been more stable than in the United States. A portion of our electricity requirements are purchased pursuant to long-term contracts in the local regions in which we operate. A number of our facilities are located in regions with regulated prices, which affords relatively stable costs. We have fixed pricing on some of our energy supply arrangements. 
Our Operating Segments
Due in part to the regional nature of supply and demand of aluminum rolled products and in order to best serve our customers, we manage our activities on the basis of geographical areas and are organized under four operating segments: North America, Europe, Asia and South America. Each segment manufactures aluminum sheet and light gauge products, and recycles aluminum. 
The table below shows “Net sales” and total shipments by segment. For additional financial information related to our operating segments, see Note 21 — Segment, Geographical Area, Major Customer and Major Supplier Information to our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements.

Additional information related to our top customers is contained in Note 21 — Segment, Geographical Area, Major Customer and Major Supplier Information to our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements.
Distribution and Backlog
We have two principal distribution channels for the end-use markets in which we operate: direct sales to our customers and sales to distributors.
 | Year Ended March 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Direct sales as a percentage of total “Net sales” | 94 | % | | 95 | % | 92 | %
Distributor sales as a percentage of total “Net sales” | 6 | % | | 5 | % | 8 | %

Direct Sales
We supply various end-use markets all over the world through a direct sales force operating from individual facilities or sales offices, as well as from regional sales offices in 10 countries. The direct sales channel typically serves very large, sophisticated fabricators and original equipment manufacturers. Longstanding relationships are maintained with leading companies in industries using aluminum rolled products. Supply contracts for large global customers generally range from one to five years in length and historically there has been a high degree of renewal business with these customers. Given the customized nature of products and in some cases, large order sizes, switching costs are significant, thus adding to the overall consistency of the customer base. 
We also use third party agents or traders in some regions to complement our own sales force. These agents provide service to our customers in countries where we do not have local expertise.
Distributors
We also sell our products through third party aluminum distributors. Customers of distributors are widely dispersed, and sales through this channel are highly fragmented. Distributors sell mostly commodity or less specialized products into many end-use markets in small quantities, including the architectural and industrial markets. We collaborate with our distributors to develop new end-use products and improve the supply chain and order efficiencies.
11

Backlog
We believe order backlog is not a material aspect of our business.
Research and Development
The table below summarizes our “Research and development expenses”, which include mini-scale production lines equipped with hot mills, can lines and continuous casters (in millions).


 | Year Ended March 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015

March 31, 2016 | 3,430 | | 4,970 | | 2,020 | | 1,550 | 11,970

We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. A substantial portion of our employees are represented by labor unions and their employment conditions are governed by collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements are negotiated on a site, regional or national level, and are of varying durations. As of March 31, 2017, approximately 1,800 of our employees were covered under collective bargaining agreements that expire within one year.
Intellectual Property
We actively review intellectual property arising from our operations and our research and development activities and, when appropriate, we apply for patents in appropriate jurisdictions. We currently hold patents and patent applications on approximately 204 different items of intellectual property. While these patents and patent applications are important to our business on an aggregate basis, no single patent or patent application is deemed to be material to our business.
We have applied for, or received registrations for, the “Novelis” word trademark and the Novelis logo trademark in approximately 50 countries where we have significant sales or operations. Novelis uses the Aditya Birla logo under license from Aditya Birla Management Corporation Private Limited.
We have also registered the word “Novelis” and several derivations thereof as domain names in numerous top level domains around the world to protect our presence on the world wide web.
Environment, Health and Safety
We own and operate numerous manufacturing and other facilities in various countries around the world. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations from various jurisdictions, which govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the remediation of contaminated sites, post-mining reclamation and restoration of natural resources, and employee health and safety. Future environmental regulations may impose stricter compliance requirements on the industries in which we operate. Additional equipment or process changes at some of our facilities may be needed to meet future requirements. The cost of meeting these requirements may be significant. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, obligations to pay damages or other costs, and injunctions and other orders, including orders to cease operations.
12

We are involved in proceedings under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as CERCLA or Superfund, or analogous state provisions regarding our liability arising from the usage, storage, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes at a number of sites in the United States, as well as similar proceedings under the laws and regulations of the other jurisdictions in which we have operations, including Brazil and certain countries in the European Union. Many of these jurisdictions have laws that impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, for the costs of environmental remediation, natural resource damages, third party claims, and other expenses. In addition, we are, from time to time, subject to environmental reviews and investigations by relevant governmental authorities.
We have established procedures for regularly evaluating environmental loss contingencies, including those arising from environmental reviews and investigations and any other environmental remediation or compliance matters. We believe we have a reasonable basis for evaluating these environmental loss contingencies, and we also believe we have made reasonable estimates for the costs that are reasonably possible for these environmental loss contingencies. Accordingly, we have established liabilities based on our estimates for the currently anticipated costs that are deemed probable associated with these environmental matters. Management has determined the currently anticipated costs associated with these environmental matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair our operations or materially adversely affect our financial condition.
