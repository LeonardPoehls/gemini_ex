Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to bringing biotech ingenuity to medical dermatology by delivering differentiated, new therapies to the millions of patients living with chronic skin conditions. We are committed to understanding the needs of both patients and physicians and using our insight to identify and develop leading-edge medical dermatology programs. Our pipeline includes three late-stage product candidates that could have a profound impact on the lives of patients: glycopyrronium tosylate (formerly DRM04), for which a New Drug Application (“NDA”) is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis (underarm sweating beyond what is needed for normal body temperature regulation); olumacostat glasaretil (formerly DRM01), in Phase 3 development for the treatment of acne vulgaris; and lebrikizumab, in Phase 2b development for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. We are headquartered in Menlo Park, California.
 We are focused on the development of therapeutic solutions in medical dermatology to treat skin conditions, such as hyperhidrosis, acne vulgaris and atopic dermatitis. These diseases impact millions of people worldwide and can have significant, multidimensional effects on patients’ quality of life, including their physical, functional and emotional well‑being. According to multiple published studies, patients report that medical dermatology conditions affect quality of life in ways comparable to other serious diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, epilepsy, asthma and arthritis.
 Our three late‑stage product candidates are:
  
• | Glycopyrronium tosylate, a novel, small-molecule investigational agent formulated as a topical, once-daily anticholinergic wipe that we are developing for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm sweating), a medical condition that results in sweating beyond what is needed for normal body temperature regulation. Anticholinergics are a class of pharmaceutical products that exert their effect by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that transmits signals within the nervous system that are responsible for a range of bodily functions, including the activation of sweat glands. Glycopyrronium tosylate is a novel form of an anticholinergic agent that has been approved for systemic administration in other indications, and is designed to block sweat production by inhibiting the interaction between acetylcholine and the cholinergic receptors responsible for sweat gland activation. In July 2015, we commenced a Phase 3 clinical program for glycopyrronium tosylate in patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis that comprised three clinical trials – the ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 pivotal trials and the ARIDO open-label safety trial. In June 2016, we announced positive topline results from the ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 trials, which enrolled a total of 697 adult and adolescent patients (ages nine and older) with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Based on the overall dataset from the intent-to-treat (“ITT”) populations, glycopyrronium tosylate demonstrated statistically significant improvements compared to vehicle for both co-primary endpoints and both secondary endpoints in the ATMOS-2 trial and one of the co-primary endpoints and both secondary endpoints compared in the ATMOS-1 trial. For the second co-primary endpoint in the ATMOS-1 trial, when extreme outlier data from one analysis center were excluded in accordance with the pre-specified statistical analysis plan submitted to the FDA, glycopyrronium tosylate demonstrated statistically significant results compared to vehicle. Consistent with the results of an earlier Phase 2b trial, glycopyrronium tosylate was well-tolerated with side effects that were primarily mild to moderate in severity. In December 2016, the treatment period for ARIDO, the open-label Phase 3 trial assessing the long-term safety of glycopyrronium tosylate, was completed. The safety and tolerability profile for glycopyrronium tosylate in the ARIDO trial was consistent with what was observed in the ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 trials. Based on the results of the glycopyrronium tosylate Phase 3 program and a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in February 2017, we submitted an NDA for glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis to the FDA. The FDA has accepted our NDA for substantive review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target date (“PDUFA date”) for the completion of the FDA’s review of the NDA by June 30, 2018.

• | Olumacostat glasaretil, a novel, small molecule designed to target sebum production following topical application that we are developing for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Sebum is an oily substance made up of lipids produced by glands in the skin called sebaceous glands, and excessive sebum production is an important aspect of acne vulgaris that is not addressed by available topical therapies. Olumacostat glasaretil is designed to exert its effect by inhibiting acetyl coenzyme-A carboxylase (“ACC”), an enzyme that plays an important role in the synthesis of fatty acids, a type of lipid that represents an essential component of the majority of sebum lipids. In April 2015, we commenced a Phase 2b dose-ranging clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of olumacostat glasaretil in adult patients with moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris, and in May 2016, we announced positive topline results. In the Phase 2b dose-ranging trial, which enrolled a total of 420 patients, olumacostat glasaretil demonstrated statistically significant improvements in all primary endpoints compared to vehicle at the highest dose and in most primary endpoints at the other doses. Olumacostat glasaretil was well-tolerated with adverse events primarily mild or moderate in severity. Based on these results, in December 2016, we initiated a Phase 3 program to evaluate the safety and efficacy of olumacostat glasaretil as a potential treatment for acne vulgaris to support a potential NDA submission to the FDA. The Phase 3 program comprises three clinical trials – the CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2 pivotal trials and the CLARITUDE open-label safety trial. In October 2017, we announced the completion of patient enrollment in CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2 with a total of 1,503 adult and adolescent patients (ages nine and older) with moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris. We expect to announce topline results from the CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2 trials in the first quarter of 2018.

• | Lebrikizumab, a novel, injectable, humanized monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin 13 (“IL-13”) that we are developing for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. IL-13 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is thought to play an important role in mediating effects of inflammation on bodily tissues, including in patients with atopic dermatitis. Lebrikizumab is designed to bind to IL-13 with high affinity, specifically preventing formation of the IL-13 receptor/interleukin 4 (“IL-4”) receptor complex and subsequent signaling. In August 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the “Roche Agreement”) with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech, Inc. (together, “Roche”) pursuant to which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis and all other indications, except Roche retains certain rights, including exclusive rights to develop and promote lebrikizumab for interstitial lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (the “Retained Field”), and rights to use lebrikizumab for internal research purposes and for in vitro diagnostic purposes. Based on the results of two exploratory Phase 2 clinical trials conducted by Roche in atopic dermatitis patients, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial in January 2018 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy compared with placebo and to establish the dosing regimen for a potential Phase 3 program in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The study is expected to enroll approximately 275 patients ages 18 years and older. We expect topline results from the Phase 2b clinical trial in the first half of 2019.

Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to develop and commercialize innovative and differentiated therapies that we believe can advance the standard of care for patients with dermatologic diseases. The key components of our strategy are to:

• | Rapidly develop our late‑stage product candidates. We produced positive clinical trial results within 10 months of initiating our Phase 3 clinical program for glycopyrronium tosylate and produced positive clinical trial results within 14 months of initiating our Phase 2b dose-ranging trial of olumacostat glasaretil. We believe that our team’s expertise in designing and executing product development programs in medical dermatology, combined with the relative efficiencies of dermatology product development, will enable us to rapidly develop our late‑stage product candidates.

• | Build specialized medical affairs and sales and marketing organizations of highly experienced professionals who can effectively communicate the science behind our programs and the benefits of our approved products and support dermatologists as well as other healthcare practitioners and their patients. We believe that we can compete effectively in the medical dermatology market by having specialized medical affairs and sales and marketing organizations focused on patients and dermatologists. To effectively communicate the science behind our programs and commercialize any approved products we may successfully develop or acquire, we are building specialized, separate medical affairs and sales and marketing organizations to provide high levels of customer support and scientific expertise to dermatologists as well as other healthcare practitioners and their patients. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize the value of our portfolio by commercializing our approved products ourselves where we can effectively do so and partnering with other companies to help us reach new markets. We currently plan to commercialize our approved products, if any, in the United States by deploying a specialized sales force targeting primarily dermatologists as well as other healthcare practitioners. We may partner with other third parties to help us reach additional geographic markets or medical specialties. For our glycopyrronium tosylate product candidate, we have granted an exclusive license to Maruho Co., Ltd. (“Maruho”) to develop and commercialize glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of hyperhidrosis in Japan. For our lebrikizumab product candidate, Roche retains certain rights, including exclusive rights to develop and promote lebrikizumab in the Retained Field. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to build a team of committed, experienced employees and engage with patients and members of the dermatology community. We believe that the field of medical dermatology offers a unique opportunity to build relationships with medical practitioners, opinion leaders, patients and advocacy groups. We believe that consolidation in the medical dermatology industry has resulted in an enhanced opportunity for a medical dermatology‑focused company to build relationships with these stakeholders and has made available a large and growing talent pool of experienced employees who can make significant contributions to our company. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficiently establish proof‑of‑concept for early‑stage product candidates and advance promising candidates into late‑stage development. In developing early‑stage product candidates, we focus on translating advances in the understanding of skin disease biology into innovative solutions for unmet needs in dermatology. We seek to rapidly and efficiently establish proof‑of‑concept for these product candidates. Using this approach, our experienced management team is able to efficiently determine whether and how to advance product candidates into the next stages of development, which we believe increases our ability to direct resources to promising programs and enhances our likelihood of successfully developing and commercializing our product candidates. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In‑license and acquire new product candidates. Since our founding in 2010, we have executed multiple transactions resulting in our portfolio of product candidates. In August 2011, we acquired Valocor Therapeutics, Inc., which gave us rights to a portfolio of intellectual property and product candidates to treat acne vulgaris and inflammatory skin diseases. In April 2013, we entered into agreements with Rose U LLC (“Rose U”) and Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., a GSK company (“Stiefel”), to obtain rights to intellectual property related to our hyperhidrosis program. In August 2017, we entered into the Roche Agreement pursuant to which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis and all other indications, except Roche retains certain rights, including exclusive rights to develop and promote lebrikizumab in the Retained Field, and rights to use lebrikizumab for internal research purposes and for in vitro diagnostic purposes. We intend to continue to identify, evaluate, in‑license and acquire product candidates from a number of sources by leveraging the insights, network and experience of our management team. Our objective is to maintain a well‑balanced portfolio by in‑licensing or acquiring additional product candidates across various stages of development.

Glycopyrronium Tosylate
 Overview
 Glycopyrronium tosylate is our late‑stage product candidate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm sweating). Glycopyrronium tosylate, a novel form of a small‑molecule anticholinergic agent that has been approved for systemic administration in other indications, is designed to block sweat production by inhibiting the interaction between acetylcholine and the cholinergic receptors responsible for sweat gland activation.
 Hyperhidrosis is a condition of sweating beyond what is physiologically required to maintain normal thermal regulation. Sweat is produced by glands in the skin and released to the skin surface through ducts. Sweat gland activity is controlled by the nervous system. The nervous system transmits signals to the sweat glands by a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. Primary hyperhidrosis, which is excessive sweating without a known cause, can affect the underarms, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, face and other areas. Several studies have demonstrated that excessive sweating often impedes normal daily activities and can result in occupational, emotional, psychological, social and physical impairment. Studies also suggest that the negative impact caused by excessive sweating has been reported to be similar to, if not greater than, the negative impact caused by conditions such as psoriasis and other chronic diseases. There are very few approved treatments for hyperhidrosis and the unmet medical need remains high.
 According to a study published in 2016, the prevalence of hyperhidrosis in the United States is estimated to be 4.8% of the population, or approximately 15.3 million people. According to this published study, 65% of hyperhidrosis sufferers in the United States have axillary hyperhidrosis.

The market for products to control sweating is large and highly underpenetrated by prescription pharmaceutical products. Despite the limited efficacy of over‑the‑counter (“OTC”) antiperspirants for the alleviation of hyperhidrosis symptoms, according to the 2016 study, only 51% of patients suffering from hyperhidrosis have discussed their condition with a healthcare professional (“HCP”). The reasons most commonly cited by hyperhidrosis sufferers for not discussing their excessive sweating with an HCP are lack of awareness that hyperhidrosis is a medical condition and belief that nothing can be done to treat their condition. Of those who do see an HCP about their hyperhidrosis, 53% were diagnosed with the condition. In addition, patients may suffer from excessive sweating for years before seeking treatment. One study analyzing data from 1993‑2005 indicated that patients experienced an average duration of untreated symptoms of 8.9 years. We believe that this is largely a result of the lack of effective, well‑tolerated and convenient prescription treatment options. For example, according to a recent Dermira survey of a sample of axillary hyperhidrosis sufferers in the United States, approximately half indicated they are not at all satisfied or only slightly satisfied with the products they are currently using to treat their condition. Patients who seek treatment from a physician most commonly receive prescription topical antiperspirants. According to data provided by IQVIA NPA, these topical antiperspirants generated approximately 410,000 prescriptions in the United States in 2017. However, their use is limited by modest efficacy, particularly in patients with more severe disease and skin irritation. We believe that the market opportunity for a new, effective, well‑tolerated and self-administered prescription topical hyperhidrosis treatment is substantially larger than the current market for prescription topical antiperspirants because such a therapy could further penetrate the segment of patients who seek treatment from a physician and encourage more patients to seek treatment. Therapeutic options for patients who are unsatisfied with topical antiperspirants are largely limited to more cumbersome or invasive strategies directed to blocking the activation of, destroying or removing the sweat glands by injectable, systemic, surgical or other means. These treatment options, which include injectable botulinum toxin (“Botox”) and off‑label use of oral anticholinergic agents, are often poorly tolerated and are used much less frequently than topical therapies.
 Based on the results of our Phase 2 program described below and an end‑of‑Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in April 2015, we commenced a Phase 3 clinical program for glycopyrronium tosylate in patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis in July 2015 that comprised three trials – the ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 pivotal trials and the ARIDO open-label safety trial. We completed patient enrollment in the ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 trials in February 2016 and announced positive topline results in June 2016. The treatment period for the ARIDO trial was completed in December 2016. Based on the results of these trials and a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in February 2017, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for approval of glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. The FDA has accepted our NDA for substantive review with a PDUFA date for the completion of the FDA’s review of the NDA by June 30, 2018. If approved, glycopyrronium tosylate is expected to be the first FDA-approved topical wipe medication specifically indicated to treat patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis.
 Clinical Development
 Our initial target indication for glycopyrronium tosylate (referred to as “G.T.” in the following charts) is primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Three Phase 2 clinical trials and three Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate efficacy and safety have been completed.
 Phase 2a Clinical Trial.  The Phase 2a clinical trial was a randomized, double‑blind study in 38 patients with severe, primary axillary hyperhidrosis. A topical formulation of a reference agent, a different form of the anticholinergic agent in glycopyrronium tosylate that has been approved for systemic administration in other indications, was administered to establish proof of concept for the treatment of hyperhidrosis. In six cohorts of six or seven patients each, two concentrations of the reference agent in each of two topical formulations were compared with their respective vehicles, which contain no active ingredient. Based on the positive results of this trial, we selected the formulation for further development and commenced our Phase 2b clinical program.
 Phase 2b Clinical Program.  Our Phase 2b clinical program comprised two randomized, multi‑center, double‑blind, vehicle‑controlled clinical trials that assessed the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of glycopyrronium tosylate, the topical formulation of the reference agent, and vehicle only in a total of 303 patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. In these studies, patients were instructed to apply the study product to each axilla once daily for four weeks using wipes containing either drug product or vehicle only, and efficacy was evaluated based on axillary sweat production, as well as disease severity as reported by patients using the widely-used Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (“HDSS”), the Axillary Hyperhidrosis Patient Measures (“AHPM”), or

both. The AHPM was developed in connection with the second Phase 2b trial according to current regulatory standards and includes three separate patient-reported outcome (“PRO”) assessments: the four-item Axillary Sweating Daily Diary (“ASDD”) for use in patients 16 years of age and older (or the two-item ASDD-C for use in patients nine to 15 years of age); six Weekly Impact Items; and a single-item Patient Global Impression of Change. The four-item ASDD was initially validated in this second Phase 2b trial and confirmed using data obtained in the Phase 3 trials described below, with Item 2 being validated for use in regulatory decision making. Validation was performed in accordance with FDA Guidance for Industry, Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims, December 2009. 
 Phase 3 Clinical Program.  Based on the results of the three Phase 2 clinical trials, we conducted an end‑of‑Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in April 2015 during which we requested and received feedback from the FDA regarding certain elements of our proposed development plan for glycopyrronium tosylate in primary axillary hyperhidrosis, including the design and size of our Phase 3 program, which we initiated in July 2015. The Phase 3 program comprised two pivotal clinical trials named ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 that were designed to assess the safety and efficacy of glycopyrronium tosylate relative to vehicle and one clinical trial named ARIDO that was designed to assess the long-term safety of glycopyrronium tosylate.
 ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 Trials.  The ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 clinical trials were designed as identical, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials to assess the safety and efficacy of glycopyrronium tosylate at a concentration of 3.75% compared to vehicle in adult and adolescent patients (ages nine and older) with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. A total of 697 patients were enrolled in the two trials. The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved at least a four-point improvement from baseline in sweating severity as measured by Item 2 of the 11-point ASDD scale and the average absolute change from baseline in gravimetrically-measured sweat production. For the purpose of the sweat production endpoint, sweat production was assessed in each patient as the average of the amounts of sweat produced in each underarm during a five-minute period. The two secondary endpoints in the trials measured the proportion of patients who had at least a two-grade improvement from baseline as measured by the HDSS and the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction from baseline in gravimetrically-measured sweat production. Patients were instructed to apply the study product to each underarm once daily for four weeks using topical wipes containing either glycopyrronium tosylate or vehicle only. Both the primary and secondary endpoints were assessed at the end of the four-week treatment period. Inclusion criteria required that, prior to the start of treatment, all patients produced at least 50 mg of sweat in each underarm over a five-minute period and rated the severity of their sweating as a four or higher on Item 2 of the ASDD (an 11-point scale) and as a three or a four on the four-grade HDSS.
 The ATMOS-1 trial enrolled 344 patients at 29 sites in the United States and Germany. In the trial, 229 patients were randomized to receive glycopyrronium tosylate, and 115 patients were randomized to receive vehicle. In this trial:
  
• | The proportion of patients who achieved at least a four-point improvement in sweating severity, as measured by Item 2 of the ASDD, was 52.8% in glycopyrronium tosylate-treated patients, compared to 28.3% in patients who received the vehicle only (p<0.001).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The average reduction in sweat production was 104.9 mg in patients treated with glycopyrronium tosylate as compared to 91.9 mg in vehicle-treated patients based on the overall dataset from the ITT population (p=0.065). As outlined in the pre-specified statistical analysis plan submitted to the FDA, a sensitivity analysis was conducted that led to the exclusion of an analysis center with extreme outlier data for the gravimetric measurement of sweat. This analysis center consisted of 14 patients, of whom nine were treated with glycopyrronium tosylate and five received vehicle only. Following the exclusion of this analysis center, patients treated with glycopyrronium tosylate demonstrated an average reduction in sweat production of 96.2 mg as compared to 90.6 mg in patients who received the vehicle only (p=0.001).

• | The proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction from baseline in gravimetrically-measured sweat production, a secondary endpoint, was 72.4% in patients treated with glycopyrronium tosylate as compared to 53.2% in patients who received the vehicle only (p<0.001).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The ATMOS-2 trial enrolled 353 patients at 20 sites in the United States. In the trial, 234 patients were randomized to receive glycopyrronium tosylate and 119 patients were randomized to receive vehicle. In this trial:
  
• | The proportion of patients who achieved at least a four-point improvement in sweating severity, as measured by Item 2 of the ASDD, was 66.1% in glycopyrronium tosylate-treated patients, compared to 26.9% in patients who received the vehicle only (p<0.001).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The average reduction in sweat production was 110.3 mg in patients treated with glycopyrronium tosylate as compared to 92.2 mg in patients who received the vehicle only (p<0.001).

• | The proportion of patients who achieved at least a two-grade improvement in HDSS score, a secondary endpoint, was 61.6% in patients treated with glycopyrronium tosylate as compared to 27.8% in patients who received the vehicle only (p<0.001).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction from baseline in gravimetrically-measured sweat production, a secondary endpoint, was 77.3% in patients treated with glycopyrronium tosylate as compared to 53.3% in patients who received the vehicle only (p<0.001).

Data are presented from the ITT population (all randomized patients dispensed study medication) except for the ATMOS-1 ITT (Ex-AC) population, which represents results of a pre-specified sensitivity analysis that led to exclusion of an analysis center (“AC”), consisting of 14 patients (9 and 5 of whom received glycopyrronium tosylate and vehicle only, respectively), with extreme outlier data in the gravimetric measurement of sweat. ASDD response rate refers to subjects’ rating the severity of their sweating on a scale from 0-10 (Item 2 of the four-item ASDD PRO instrument). P-values reflect the probability of an observation occurring due to chance alone. P-values of less than 0.05 (denoted by *) typically represent statistically significant results. The P-values shown above represent comparisons to corresponding data observed in patients who received vehicle only.

Consistent with the results from the Phase 2 clinical program, glycopyrronium tosylate was generally well-tolerated with side effects that were primarily mild to moderate in severity. 
  
• | In ATMOS-1, the most frequently reported adverse events were dry mouth (18.9% and 3.5% for glycopyrronium tosylate and the vehicle only, respectively), application site pain (8.8% and 9.6%), dilated pupil (mydriasis; 6.6% and 0.0%), headache (4.4% and 2.6%), sore throat (oropharyngeal pain; 4.0% and 1.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (4.0% and 0.9%), blurred vision (3.5% and 0.0%), urinary hesitation (2.2% and 0.0%) and dry eye (0.9% and 0.0%). In this trial, 3.5% (8/229) of patients treated with glycopyrronium tosylate withdrew from the trial due to adverse events, compared to 0.9% (1/115) of patients who received vehicle only. There was one treatment-related serious adverse event reported in this trial for a patient treated with glycopyrronium tosylate who reported a dilated pupil.

• | In ATMOS-2, the most frequently reported adverse events were dry mouth (29.3% and 7.6% for glycopyrronium tosylate and the vehicle only, respectively), application site pain (8.6% and 9.3%), dilated pupil (mydriasis; 6.9% and 0.0%), headache (5.6% and 1.7%), sore throat (oropharyngeal pain; 7.3% and 0.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (2.2% and 4.2%), blurred vision (3.4% and 0.0%), urinary hesitation (4.7% and 0.0%) and dry eye (3.9% and 0.8%). In this trial, 3.8% (9/234) of patients treated with glycopyrronium tosylate withdrew from the trial due to adverse events, compared to 0.0% (0/119) who received vehicle only. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events reported in the ATMOS-2 trial.

 Dry mouth, dilated pupil, blurred vision, urinary hesitation and dry eye are well-known side effects of anticholinergic agents.

In addition to the ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 trials, we also conducted ARIDO, an open-label trial assessing the long-term safety of glycopyrronium tosylate, as part of our Phase 3 program to provide safety data for a minimum of 100 patients who had received glycopyrronium tosylate for at least 12 months per the International Council for Harmonisation guidelines. Patients from the ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 trials were permitted to enroll in the ARIDO trial and continued to receive glycopyrronium tosylate (active treatment) for up to an additional 44 weeks from the end of the four-week treatment periods in the ATMOS-1 or ATMOS-2 trials. A total of 564 patients, more than 80% of those enrolled in the ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 trials, elected to enroll in ARIDO. In December 2016, the treatment period for ARIDO was completed. The safety and tolerability profile of glycopyrronium tosylate in the ARIDO study was consistent with what was observed in the ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 Phase 3 clinical trials.
 Regulatory Pathway.  Based on these results and a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in February 2017, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for approval of glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. We are seeking FDA approval of glycopyrronium tosylate through Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “505(b)(2) pathway”). Under the 505(b)(2) pathway, we may be allowed to leverage certain findings made by the FDA in approving the anticholinergic agent we intend to reference in our NDA, which could expedite the glycopyrronium tosylate development program by potentially decreasing the amount of non-clinical or clinical data that we would need to generate to obtain FDA approval. The degree to which we will be permitted to leverage such findings, if at all, will be dependent upon our ability to demonstrate an acceptable clinical bridge through comparative pharmacokinetic data between glycopyrronium tosylate and the approved product, which have different chemical structures, routes of administration, dosage forms and indications. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) pathway or that use of the Section 505(b)(2) pathway would lead to faster product development or earlier approval. The FDA has accepted our NDA for substantive review with a PDUFA date for the completion of the FDA’s review of the NDA by June 30, 2018.

Olumacostat Glasaretil 
 Overview
 Olumacostat glasaretil is our late-stage product for the treatment of acne vulgaris. It is a novel, small molecule designed to target sebum production following topical application. Sebum is an oily substance made up of lipids produced by glands in the skin called sebaceous glands, and excessive sebum production is an important aspect of acne that is not addressed by available topical therapies. Olumacostat glasaretil is designed to exert its effect by inhibiting acetyl coenzyme‑A carboxylase, an enzyme that plays an important role in the synthesis of fatty acids, a type of lipid that represents an essential component of the majority of sebum lipids.
 Acne is one of the most common skin diseases. It is characterized by clogging of the pores and associated local skin lesions that usually appear on the face, chest or back. Acne lesions are believed to result from an interaction of four primary pathogenic, or contributing, factors: (1) excessive production of sebum; (2) alterations in skin cells that, in concert with excess sebum production, contribute to clogging of pores through which sebum is normally released to the skin surface; (3) colonization of the area in and around the sebaceous glands by bacteria that are nourished by sebum; and (4) inflammation often associated with colonization by bacteria and their breakdown of sebum into irritating breakdown products. Clogged pores can become enlarged and inflamed as sebum and its breakdown products accumulate, resulting in visible lesions that can be unsightly and cause permanent scarring.
 Acne can significantly impact patients’ quality of life, resulting in social, psychological and emotional impairments that are comparable to those reported by patients with epilepsy, asthma, diabetes or arthritis. According to widely‑cited data, acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin conditions, affecting up to 50 million people in the United States. It is estimated that approximately 85% of people in the United States between the ages of 12 and 24 experience acne, and acne is the reason most cited for visits to the dermatologists by patients 14 to 45 years old. According to GfK Custom Research, LLC, acne represented nearly one‑fourth of U.S. dermatologists’ patient volume in 2015.
 Based on US IQVIA data, the annual market for acne products in the United States was approximately $3.5 billion in 2017, with topical products accounting for approximately $2.2 billion. These IQVIA data also indicate that there were 25.1 million acne product prescriptions in the United States in 2017, nearly 60% of which were for topical products. The major product classes predominantly used to treat acne have been available for over 30 years, and we believe that growth in this market recently has been significantly limited by a lack of innovation in new product development.
 We believe that there is a substantial unmet need and commercial opportunity for a topical acne therapy that targets sebum production. Acne treatment guidelines published by the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne recommend that acne treatment be directed toward as many pathogenic factors as possible. Accordingly, patients are often treated with regimens that incorporate agents with complementary mechanisms of action targeting different pathogenic factors. The vast majority of acne patients are treated with topical therapies, and all of the four primary pathogenic factors except for excessive sebum production can be targeted with available topical treatments. While systemic therapies may affect sebum production, their use is limited by significant, systemic side effects. As a result, we believe that the introduction of a topical acne treatment that is designed to target sebum production could establish a new product class and expand the market for acne treatment.
 Based on the results of our Phase 2 program described below and an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, in December 2016 we commenced a Phase 3 clinical program for olumacostat glasaretil as a potential treatment for acne vulgaris in adult and adolescent patients (ages nine and older) that comprises the CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2 pivotal trials and the CLARITIUDE open-label safety trial. We announced the completion of patient enrollment in the CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2 trials in October 2017 and expect to announce topline results from both of these trials in the first quarter of 2018.

Clinical Development
 We are developing olumacostat glasaretil (referred to as “O.G.” in the following charts) in accordance with published FDA draft guidance regarding the development of acne drugs. Established in 2005, this draft guidance has been widely used in the design, conduct and analysis of clinical trials intended to support marketing approval for new acne products. We have completed Phase 1, Phase 2a and Phase 2b clinical trials to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of olumacostat glasaretil.
 Phase 1 Clinical Trial.  In the Phase 1 clinical trial, six healthy volunteers applied topical olumacostat glasaretil gel to the face for seven days. All subjects completed dosing, and no adverse events were reported.
 Phase 2a Clinical Trial.  The FDA recommends that the principal clinical trials used to demonstrate safety and efficacy of acne therapies in support of marketing approval be randomized, multi‑center, blinded trials designed to demonstrate superiority of the investigational product relative to a vehicle or placebo control following a treatment duration of at least 12 weeks. Our Phase 2a clinical trial was a randomized, multi‑center, double‑blind, vehicle‑controlled study designed in accordance with the published FDA draft guidance. In this trial, 108 patients with moderate or severe acne vulgaris were instructed to apply either olumacostat glasaretil gel or vehicle gel to the face twice daily for 12 weeks. Olumacostat glasaretil gel was formulated at a concentration of 7.5%. Of the 108 patients enrolled in the trial, 53 were randomized to receive olumacostat glasaretil, and the other 55 were randomized to receive vehicle only.
 Three primary efficacy endpoints recommended in the published FDA draft guidance were used as primary efficacy endpoints in this trial:
  
• | Inflammatory lesion count, assessed as the absolute change from baseline in the number of inflammatory acne lesions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non‑inflammatory lesion count, assessed as the absolute change from baseline in the number of non‑inflammatory acne lesions; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Investigator’s Global Assessment (“IGA”) assessed as the proportion of patients who achieve a successful improvement in the investigator’s assessment of disease severity, as assessed on a five‑point scale that ranges from a score of zero, representing clear skin, to a score of four, representing severe disease.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In our trial, lesions were counted by the investigators, and a successful improvement in IGA score was defined as a reduction from baseline of at least two points on the IGA scale. As is standard practice in acne clinical trials, the primary efficacy endpoints were assessed on the face at the end of the 12‑week treatment period. In addition to evaluating the primary efficacy endpoints, we conducted several non‑primary efficacy analyses, including an evaluation of the percent change from baseline in the number of inflammatory lesions and an evaluation of the percent change from baseline in the number of non‑inflammatory lesions, each as assessed on the face at the end of the 12‑week treatment period.
 13

As outlined below, olumacostat glasaretil demonstrated statistically significant improvements relative to vehicle in all three primary efficacy endpoints. The following chart summarizes the impact of olumacostat glasaretil on acne lesion counts. Based on these results, patients treated with olumacostat glasaretil achieved a 45% greater average absolute reduction in inflammatory lesion count and a 78% greater average absolute reduction in non‑inflammatory lesion count than patients who received vehicle only.
 
 
Changes in Lesion Counts at Week 12


* | P < 0.01 vs. placebo. The P-values shown above represent comparisons to corresponding data in patients who received vehicle only.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Data represent average changes from baseline. As recommended in the published FDA draft guidance regarding the development of acne drugs, data are presented from the ITT population, defined as all randomized patients who were dispensed study product, and the last available on‑treatment observation is used to estimate missing data points. The average lesion count at baseline includes all 108 patients in the ITT population. Missing data for one patient in the vehicle cohort for whom no on‑treatment efficacy assessment was available are excluded from the patient population observed at the end of the 12‑week treatment period.
 When analyzing the Phase 2a study data looking at per‑protocol patients, a population that is smaller in size and thus has lower statistical power, although the IGA and inflammatory lesion count results are statistically significant (p=0.0314 and p=0.0048, respectively), the non‑inflammatory lesion count results do not reach statistical significance (p=0.0566).
 14

The following chart summarizes the impact of olumacostat glasaretil on the third primary efficacy endpoint: the proportion of patients who achieved a successful improvement in the severity of their disease, as assessed using the IGA. Based on these results, patients treated with olumacostat glasaretil were more than three times more likely than patients who received vehicle only to achieve a successful improvement in IGA score.

* | P < 0.01 vs. placebo. The P-values shown above represent comparisons to corresponding data in patients who received vehicle only.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As recommended in the published FDA draft guidance regarding the development of acne drugs, data are presented from the ITT population, defined as all randomized patients who were dispensed study product. In this analysis, patients with missing data points were considered non‑responders.
 The most common adverse events observed in this clinical trial were upper respiratory tract infections, which were considered unrelated to treatment, and application‑site conditions, which are frequently observed in most clinical trials of topical products. No treatment‑related serious adverse events were reported.
 Phase 2b Clinical Trial.  Based on the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile observed in the Phase 2a clinical trial, we commenced a Phase 2b dose-ranging clinical trial in April 2015. The Phase 2b trial was a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of olumacostat glasaretil compared to vehicle in adult patients 18 years and older with moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris. A total of 420 patients were enrolled in the study at 34 sites in the United States and Canada. Consistent with the previous Phase 2a trial, the primary endpoints were absolute changes from baseline in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts and the proportion of patients achieving at least a two-point improvement from baseline in the five-point IGA scale. Each endpoint was measured on the face at the end of the 12-week treatment period. Inclusion criteria required a minimum of 20 inflammatory lesions and 20 non-inflammatory lesions and an IGA score of three or four on a five-point scale that ranges from a score of zero, representing clear skin, to a score of four, representing severe disease, in all cases measured on the face.
 Patients were randomized into five separate arms and instructed to apply olumacostat glasaretil at concentrations of 4.0% once daily (n=106), 7.5% once daily (n=110) or 7.5% twice daily (n=101), or to apply vehicle once or twice daily (n=53 and n=50, respectively), in all cases for 12 weeks.
 15

In the Phase 2b trial, olumacostat glasaretil demonstrated statistically significant improvements from baseline to week 12 relative to vehicle in all primary efficacy endpoints at the highest dose of olumacostat glasaretil tested and in most primary endpoints at the two lower doses tested.
  
• | At the 7.5% twice daily dose, olumacostat glasaretil demonstrated statistically significant improvements from baseline to week 12 relative to vehicle in all primary efficacy endpoints. This highest dose of olumacostat glasaretil also demonstrated the highest efficacy in all primary endpoints compared to the two lower doses. Following 12 weeks of treatment, the number of inflammatory lesions in patients treated with this highest dose of olumacostat glasaretil was reduced by an average of 15.0 compared to 10.7 in patients in the combined vehicle group (p=0.001), or an average percentage reduction of 55.6% compared to 40.0% (p<0.001). The number of non-inflammatory lesions in patients treated with this same dose of olumacostat glasaretil was reduced by an average of 17.5 compared to 9.3 in patients in the combined vehicle group (p<0.001), or an average percentage reduction of 47.8% compared to 28.7% (p<0.001). At the end of the 12-week treatment period, 25.9% of patients treated with this highest dose of olumacostat glasaretil achieved a successful improvement in the IGA score (minimum two-grade improvement) compared to 9.8% of patients in the combined vehicle group (p=0.004).

• | At the 7.5% once daily dose, olumacostat glasaretil demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion count endpoints compared to the combined vehicle group, and approached but did not reach statistical significance in the IGA improvement endpoint. Following 12 weeks of treatment, the number of inflammatory lesions in patients treated with this dose of olumacostat glasaretil was reduced by an average of 14.5 compared to 10.7 in patients in the combined vehicle group (p=0.004), or an average percentage reduction of 53.3% compared to 40.0% (p=0.004). The number of non-inflammatory lesions in patients treated with olumacostat glasaretil at the 7.5% dose once daily was reduced by an average of 13.4 compared to 9.3 in patients in the combined vehicle group (p=0.050), or an average percentage reduction of 36.6% compared to 28.7% (p=0.152). At the end of the same 12-week treatment period, 19.2% of patients achieved a successful improvement in the IGA score (minimum two-grade improvement) compared to 9.8% of patients in the combined vehicle group (p=0.063).

• | At the 4.0% once daily dose, olumacostat glasaretil demonstrated statistically significant improvements in all three primary endpoints compared to the combined vehicle group. Following 12 weeks of treatment, the number of inflammatory lesions in patients treated with this dose of olumacostat glasaretil was reduced by an average of 14.6 compared to 10.7 in patients in the combined vehicle group (p=0.003), or an average percentage reduction of 54.8% compared to 40.0% (p=0.002). The number of non-inflammatory lesions in patients treated with olumacostat glasaretil at the 4.0% dose once daily was reduced by an average of 15.3 compared to 9.3 in patients in the combined vehicle group (p=0.004), or an average percentage reduction of 42.1% compared to 28.7% (p=0.014). At the end of the same 12-week treatment period, 21.6% of patients achieved a successful improvement in the IGA score (minimum two-grade improvement) compared to 9.8% of patients in the combined vehicle group (p=0.024).

Changes in Lesion Counts at Week 12 | IGA Response Rate at Week 12


Lesion count data represent average changes from baseline. As recommended in the published FDA guidance, data are presented from the ITT population, defined as all randomized patients dispensed study product. The vehicle group represents all patients who received vehicle once daily (“qd”) or twice daily (“bid”). Missing values were handled using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo multiple imputation. IGA response rate reflects the percentage of patients achieving at least a two-point improvement in IGA score from baseline. The P-values shown above represent comparisons to corresponding data observed in the combined vehicle group. P-values of less than 0.05 are denoted by *.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Consistent with the Phase 2a trial, olumacostat glasaretil was well-tolerated. Adverse events were primarily mild or moderate in severity. The most frequently reported adverse events across all three olumacostat glasaretil treatment groups were common cold (nasopharyngitis; 5.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (2.5%) and application site itching (pruritus; 2.5%). All of the cases of common cold and upper respiratory tract infection were considered unrelated to treatment. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported.
 Phase 3 Clinical Program.  Based on the results of these two Phase 2 clinical trials, we conducted an end‑of‑Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in September 2016 during which we requested and received feedback from the FDA regarding certain elements of our proposed development plan for olumacostat glasaretil in acne vulgaris, including the design and size of Phase 3 clinical trials. We initiated our Phase 3 clinical program in December 2016.
 The Phase 3 clinical program consists of two randomized, multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled trials, CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2, designed to assess the safety and efficacy of olumacostat glasaretil compared to vehicle to support a potential NDA submission to the FDA. In October 2017, we announced the completion of the enrollment of 1,503 patients ages nine and older (759 in CLAREOS-1 and 744 in CLAREOS-2) with moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris at 94 sites in the United States, Canada and Australia. In each trial, patients were randomized in a 2:1 fashion and instructed to apply either olumacostat glasaretil at a concentration of 5.0% or vehicle twice daily for 12 weeks.
 17

Consistent with the two earlier Phase 2 trials, inclusion criteria require a minimum of 20 inflammatory lesions and 20 non-inflammatory lesions and an IGA score of three or four on a five-point scale that ranges from a score of zero, representing clear skin, to a score of four, representing severe disease, in all cases measured on the face. The primary endpoints of both trials will evaluate the absolute changes from baseline in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts and the proportion of patients achieving at least a two-grade improvement from baseline to a final grade of 0 or 1 on the five-point IGA scale. Secondary endpoints will evaluate the percentage change from baseline in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts and the proportion of patients achieving at least a two-grade improvement from baseline on the five-point IGA scale. All efficacy endpoints will be measured on the face at the end of the 12-week treatment period. Safety will also be assessed.
 The Phase 3 program also includes an open-label study, CLARITUDE, assessing the long-term safety of olumacostat glasaretil, in which approximately 700 patients from either of the two Phase 3 studies will be permitted to continue to receive treatment for up to an additional 36 weeks.  
 We expect to announce topline results from the CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2 trials in the first quarter of 2018.
 Lebrikizumab
 Overview
 Lebrikizumab is our late-stage product candidate for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. IL-13 is a naturally occurring molecule that is thought to play an important role in mediating effects of inflammation on bodily tissues, including in patients with atopic dermatitis. Lebrikizumab is designed to bind IL-13 with high affinity, specifically preventing formation of the IL-13 receptor/IL-4 receptor complex and subsequent signaling. Roche has studied lebrikizumab in clinical trials involving more than 4,000 subjects across a range of conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, including two exploratory Phase 2 clinical trials in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis patients. In August 2017, we entered into a licensing agreement with Roche pursuant to which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis and all other indications, except Roche retains certain rights, including exclusive rights to develop and promote lebrikizumab in the Retained Field, and rights to use lebrikizumab for internal research purposes and for in vitro diagnostic purposes.
 Atopic dermatitis is the most common and severe form of eczema, a chronic inflammatory condition that can present as early as childhood and continue into adulthood. It is estimated to affect 12% of children and 10% of adults. A complex disorder involving an interplay of immune system dysfunction, skin barrier compromise and environmental exposures, atopic dermatitis is characterized by dry, itchy, red, swollen and/or cracked skin, often accompanied by increased risk of infection, as well as intense, persistent itching that exacerbates skin barrier disruption and other clinical symptoms. Moderate-to-severe disease can cover much of the body and have a profound, negative impact on patients’ mental and physical functioning, limiting their sleep quality, activities and health-related quality of life.
 Atopic dermatitis is commonly treated with topical products, including moisturizing emollients, corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, as well as topical and oral antimicrobial therapies to manage skin infections and antihistamines to aid in the management of itch. Moderate-to-severe disease is often treated with systemic, immunomodulatory therapy, most commonly oral corticosteroids and less frequently other immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, which carry risks of well-documented side effects, including kidney, liver and blood toxicity, that require intensive monitoring by the prescribing physician during long-term use. In March 2017, Dupixent, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling by binding to the IL-4 receptor subunit, became the first systemic therapy specifically approved by the FDA for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, offering a significant advance in treatment based on its efficacy and lack of systemic side effects associated with oral corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants.
 The introduction of new, targeted therapies, such as Dupixent, is projected to transform the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in much the same way that the advent of biologic therapies transformed the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis over the past 14 years. Prior to FDA approval of the first biologic therapy 
 18

for psoriasis in 2003, moderate-to-severe psoriasis was treated with many of the same oral immunosuppressants used to treat atopic dermatitis today, with moderate efficacy and well-documented side effects. According to Decision Resources, since the FDA approved the first biologic therapy for psoriasis in 2003, and with the subsequent introduction of systemic, biologic and small-molecule therapies targeting a range of inflammatory mediators, the market for psoriasis therapies in the United States has grown approximately tenfold and was projected to total more than $8 billion in sales in 2017.
 In comparison with psoriasis, which Decision Resources estimates currently affects approximately 8.6 million people in the United States, of whom approximately 1.7 million suffer from moderate-to-severe disease, atopic dermatitis is estimated to affect 33 million people in the United States, of whom approximately 
7 million suffer from moderate-to-severe disease. With the introduction of new, targeted therapies, such as Dupixent, EvaluatePharma estimates that worldwide sales of atopic dermatitis medications will grow from $0.9 billion in 2016 to $6.0 billion in 2022. 
 IL-13 and Lebrikizumab.  IL-13 is thought to play an important role in mediating effects of inflammation on bodily tissues in atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases. In atopic dermatitis, IL-13 is highly expressed in skin lesions, where expression levels appear to correlate with lesion severity and chronicity. It is hypothesized that dysregulation of IL-13 disrupts the skin’s ability to serve as an effective barrier to environmental exposures, and it has been established that IL-13 down-regulates production of structural proteins that are important for maintenance of skin barrier integrity. Blocking IL-13 has been shown to increase production of these proteins and reduce inflammation in preclinical models of atopic dermatitis. Successful treatment of atopic dermatitis normalizes both IL-13 expression and IL-13-mediated signaling. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated improvements in signs and symptoms in atopic dermatitis patients treated with monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-13. 
 We believe that lebrikizumab offers an attractive approach to the treatment of atopic dermatitis based on its ability to bind IL-13 with high affinity, specifically disrupting formation of the IL-13 receptor/IL-4 receptor complex and subsequent downstream signaling. Whereas many antibodies that bind receptor proteins are rapidly cleared from the body following binding to their targets, lebrikizumab, like many antibodies that bind circulating proteins, such as IL-13, is cleared from the body more slowly. Relative to other antibodies targeting IL-13, lebrikizumab has high affinity for its target, as well as a differentiated mechanism of action that does not involve inhibition of the binding of IL-13 to an alternate IL-13 receptor that serves as a natural regulator of IL-13 activity. These characteristics may enable lebrikizumab to be more effective and/or less frequently administered than many other antibodies.
 Roche has studied lebrikizumab in clinical trials involving more than 4,000 subjects across a range of conditions, including two exploratory Phase 2 clinical trials in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis patients. In addition to the initial efficacy results generated in atopic dermatitis patients, we believe the substantial safety experience accumulated across the lebrikizumab program to date is supportive of the development of lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis. 
 Additionally, the potentially important role of IL-13 in mediating the effects of inflammation across multiple bodily tissues suggests that lebrikizumab may have applicability in conditions beyond atopic dermatitis. In clinical trials conducted to date, lebrikizumab has usually been administered once every four weeks (“q4w”).
 Clinical Development in Atopic Dermatitis
 Phase 2a Clinical Trials.  In addition to a number of studies in other potential indications, Roche has completed two exploratory Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating lebrikizumab in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.
 TREBLE Phase 2 Exploratory Clinical Study.  The TREBLE study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase 2, proof-of-concept study designed and conducted by Roche to assess the efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab, administered via subcutaneous injection as add-on therapy to twice-daily topical corticosteroids (“TCS”) in 209 adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Dosing in this study was largely based on experience with lebrikizumab in asthma clinical trials and the objective of characterizing both dose-response relationships and dosing frequency requirements in atopic dermatitis.
 19

After two weeks of twice daily TCS therapy, patients in the TREBLE study were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive either a single dose of 125 milligrams (“mg”) of lebrikizumab plus continued TCS (n=52), a single, 250-mg dose of lebrikizumab plus TCS (n=53), 125 mg of lebrikizumab q4w plus TCS (n=51), or placebo q4w plus TCS (n=53), for up to 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving a 50% reduction from baseline in the 72-point clinical grading scale called the Eczema Area and Severity Index (“EASI-50”), an endpoint that has been widely used to measure treatment success in clinical atopic dermatitis trials, at the end of the 12-week treatment period.  In addition, the time course of response to lebrikizumab treatment was assessed via a range of other measures, including EASI-50, as well as the proportion of patients achieving a 75% reduction from baseline in EASI score (“EASI-75”), the proportion of patients achieving a 90% reduction from baseline in EASI score (“EASI-90”), and the proportion of patients achieving clearing or near clearing of atopic dermatitis, as rated by the investigator on a five-point scale called the Investigator Global Assessment that ranges from zero, representing clear skin, to four, representing severe disease (“IGA0/1”). Inclusion criteria required that patients had an inadequate response to TCS and a regular emollient, and at both screening and the end of the initial two weeks of TCS treatment prior to the initiation of lebrikizumab treatment, had an EASI score of at least 14 and an IGA score of at least three.
 The results of the TREBLE study provided proof-of-concept for the treatment of atopic dermatitis with lebrikizumab, including information we believe that we can use to optimize the clinical profile of lebrikizumab in future clinical trials. Across a number of key efficacy measures employed in this study, lebrikizumab provided clinically meaningful placebo-corrected improvements, generally in a dose-dependent manner. These improvements were observed on top of intensive TCS application that was associated with substantial responses in the placebo group.
 Efficacy across Key Measures over 12 Weeks


P-values shown above are as of the end of the 12-week treatment period and represent comparisons to corresponding data in patients who received placebo only. P-values of less than 0.05 are denoted by *.
 After 12 weeks of treatment, relative to patients who received placebo, the group of patients who received 125 mg of lebrikizumab q4w achieved statistically significant improvements in the primary endpoint, EASI-50 (82.4% vs. 62.3%, p=0.03). Improvements were also seen in the EASI-75 (54.9% vs. 34.0%, p=0.04) and EASI-90 (25.5% vs. 9.4%, p=0.03). The percentage of subjects achieving IGA0/1 was 33.3% in the 125 mg lebrikizumab group and 18.9% in the placebo group (p=0.10). In these patients, placebo-adjusted efficacy across these measures did not appear to plateau at the end of the 12-week treatment period, consistent with the fact that in the absence of a loading dose, circulating lebrikizumab concentrations likely did not reach a steady state during this period. While the groups of patients who received single, 125- or 250-mg doses of lebrikizumab generally did not achieve statistically significant improvements relative to those who received placebo after 12 weeks of observation in this study, results in these patients showed that placebo-adjusted effects on disease severity appeared to peak several weeks following the administration of a single lebrikizumab injection.
 We believe that the dose-response relationships observed across multiple endpoints, as well as trends toward improved efficacy with increasing dose and duration, suggest that increasing the dose and/or duration of repeated administration of lebrikizumab may result in improved efficacy in future clinical atopic dermatitis trials, an effect that may be further improved by the introduction of a loading dose to achieve steady-state circulating lebrikizumab concentrations shortly after the start of therapy. Additionally, we believe that the time course of the responses

observed in the TREBLE study, including following single doses of lebrikizumab, suggest that it may be feasible to administer lebrikizumab q4w, if not less frequently, in atopic dermatitis.
 ARBAN Phase 2 Exploratory Clinical Study.  ARBAN was an open-label study designed to assess the safety of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy, with an exploratory assessment of efficacy, in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with lebrikizumab. 
 Safety and Tolerability.  Consistent with results observed across the lebrikizumab program to date, lebrikizumab was generally well-tolerated in these exploratory clinical studies in atopic dermatitis. There were no imbalances in proportions of patients reporting adverse events, serious adverse events, events leading to discontinuation, or overall infections when comparing all lebrikizumab-treated patients with controls. Four patients (2.2%) in the lebrikizumab groups (all doses combined) and two control patients (2.5%) experienced an adverse event that led to withdrawal from the studies. Injection-site reactions occurred infrequently (in 1.2% of patients in all lebrikizumab groups and 1.3% of control patients).
 Phase 2b Clinical Program.  Based on the results of the exploratory clinical trials conducted by Roche in atopic dermatitis, in January 2018 we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 2b dose-ranging study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy compared with placebo, and to establish the dosing regimen for a potential Phase 3 program. The study is designed to evaluate our hypothesis that the efficacy of lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis may be improved by increasing the dose and duration of repeated administration, together with the introduction of a loading dose. The study is expected to enroll approximately 275 patients ages 18 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis at sites in the United States. The study will evaluate three active treatment groups compared to a placebo treatment group, for 16 weeks, with patients randomized in a 3:3:3:2 fashion:

• | Treatment Group 1: A loading dose of 250 mg of lebrikizumab at week zero, followed by 125 mg of lebrikizumab every four weeks.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Treatment Group 2: A loading dose of 500 mg of lebrikizumab at week zero, followed by 250 mg of lebrikizumab every four weeks.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Treatment Group 3: A loading dose of 500 mg of lebrikizumab at weeks zero and two, followed by 250 mg of lebrikizumab every two weeks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Treatment Group 4: Placebo at week zero and every two weeks thereafter.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The primary endpoint of the study is the percent change in the EASI score from baseline to week 16. Key secondary endpoints that will be evaluated during the 16-week treatment period include EASI-50, EASI-75 and EASI-90; the proportion of patients with an IGA score of zero (clear) or one (almost clear) and a reduction of two or more points (on a five-point scale) from baseline; and changes in pruritus (itch) and sleep loss and scores from baseline, both scored using 11-point numerical rating scales. Key inclusion criteria for patients enrolled in this study include chronic atopic dermatitis for at least one year, an EASI score of 16 or greater, an IGA score of three or four, and involvement of at least 10% of body surface area at screening and baseline. Following the end of the 16-week treatment period, patients will be followed for an additional 16 weeks.
 We expect topline results from this Phase 2b clinical trial in the first half of 2019.
 Research Programs
 We continue to work on other compounds in early stages of development. In August 2016, we entered into an exclusive option and license agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”) pursuant to which we acquired an option to license exclusive worldwide rights for three early-stage programs with undisclosed mechanisms of action as potential topical treatment options for dermatologic diseases. In December 2017, we acquired from Takeda an option to license exclusive worldwide rights for an additional early-stage program. If we exercise our option for any program, we would obtain an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize selected compounds from that program and be solely responsible for further research, development and commercialization costs related to these compounds.

Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant change. While we believe that our development and commercialization experience, scientific knowledge and industry relationships provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced if our competitors develop or market products or other novel therapies that are more effective, safer or less costly than our current or future product candidates, or obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product candidates. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of product candidates that are safer and/or more effective than competing products.Hyperhidrosis
 If approved for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, we anticipate that glycopyrronium tosylate would compete with other therapies used for hyperhidrosis, including:
  
• | Self‑Administered Treatments. Self‑administered treatments include OTC and prescription topical antiperspirants. Oral and compounded topical anticholinergics may also be used off‑label.

 Atopic Dermatitis
 If approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, we anticipate that lebrikizumab would compete with other approved and marketed prescription atopic dermatitis products, including:
 23

 
• | Injected Biologic Products. Dupixent, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-4 and IL-13 signaling marketed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Sanofi-Aventis Groupe S.A., is the only systemic therapy currently approved by the FDA specifically to treat atopic dermatitis. Monoclonal antibodies targeting other molecules, such as Xolair, a monoclonal antibody targeting immunoglobulin E marketed by Roche and Novartis AG (“Novartis”), may be used off-label.

There are also several prescription, non-prescription and OTC topical products utilized to treat atopic dermatitis, including Eucrisa, marketed by Pfizer, topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors, as well as bath solutions and moisturizers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis treatments that are currently available for commercial use, there are several pharmaceutical product candidates that are under development and could potentially be used to treat atopic dermatitis and compete with lebrikizumab. Product candidates in or about to begin Phase 3 development include tralokinumab from LEO Pharma, baricitinib from Eli Lilly and Company (“Eli Lilly”), PF-04945842 from Pfizer and upadacitinib from AbbVie. There are also product candidates in earlier stages of development that could potentially be used to treat atopic dermatitis and compete with lebrikizumab, including products currently being developed by Asana Biosciences, LLC; AnaptysBio, Inc.; Amgen Inc. (“Amgen”) and MedImmune, LLC, a division of AstraZeneca PLC; Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Galderma and Maruho; DS BioPharma Limited; Galapagos NV and MorphoSys AG; GSK; Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited; Menlo Therapeutics Inc.; Novartis; Pfizer; and Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc.
 Commercial Operations
 We are building a commercial infrastructure to support the potential commercialization of our product candidates in the United States. We intend to build a targeted sales force to establish relationships with dermatologists as well as other healthcare practitioners and other prescribers. We expect that our sales force will be supported by sales management, an internal marketing group, market access and payer efforts and supply chain management. In addition to our efforts with physicians, we are committing and will continue to commit financial and management resources to engage patients directly. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that our product candidates will be approved, and we could invest resources and then later learn that a particular product candidate is not being approved. We may also partner with third parties to help us reach other geographic markets or therapeutic specialties.

Research and Development
 Total research and development expenses were $104.4 million, $83.2 million and $66.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. With respect to the former, our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications on inventions that are important to the development and conduct of our business with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and its foreign counterparts. We seek to avoid the latter by monitoring patents and publications that may affect our business, and to the extent we identify such developments, evaluate and take appropriate courses of action.
 As of December 31, 2017, we own or have an exclusive license to 27 issued U.S. patents and 50 issued foreign patents, which include granted European patent rights that have been validated in various EU member states, and 10 pending U.S. patent applications and 50 pending foreign patent applications. 
 Issued U.S. and foreign patents and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, if issued, for our lead product candidates, glycopyrronium tosylate, olumacostat glasaretil and lebrikizumab, will expire between 2020 and 2037.
 We also use other forms of protection, such as trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach will provide us with proprietary positions for our product candidates, where available.
 Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
 We also protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. In addition, we also require confidentiality or service agreements from third parties that receive our confidential information or materials.
 Collaboration and License Agreements
 Agreements with Rose U and Stiefel
 In April 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Rose U pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide exclusive license within a field of use including hyperhidrosis to practice, enforce and otherwise exploit certain patent rights, know‑how and data related to our hyperhidrosis program. The license agreement with Rose U included a sublicense of certain data and an assignment of certain regulatory filings which Rose U had obtained from Stiefel. In connection with the license agreement, we entered into a letter agreement with Stiefel pursuant to which we assumed Rose U’s obligation to pay Stiefel approximately $2.5 million in connection with the commercialization of products developed using the licensed data and to indemnify Stiefel for claims arising from the use, development or commercialization of products developed using the Stiefel data. The agreements require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products using the licensed patent rights, know‑how and data.
 25

Pursuant to these agreements with Rose U and the related agreement with Stiefel with respect to our hyperhidrosis program, we have paid license and other fees of $0.8 million to Rose U and are required to pay additional amounts totaling up to $4.1 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory, commercialization and other milestones under these agreements to Rose U and Stiefel. In addition, we are obligated to pay Rose U low‑to‑mid single‑digit royalties on net product sales and low double‑digit royalties on sublicense fees and certain milestone, royalty and other contingent payments received from sublicensees, to the extent such amounts are in excess of the milestone and royalty payments we are obligated to pay Rose U directly upon the events or sales triggering such payments.
 We are permitted to grant sublicenses to the licensed rights and may assign the agreements upon an acquisition of us or our assets that relate to the license agreement, provided that in the event of an acquisition of our assets we must first pay to Stiefel the commercialization payment we are obligated to make on behalf of Rose U, if such amount has not already been paid. We may terminate the license agreement if Rose U experiences certain insolvency events or if Rose U commits a material breach of the license agreement, subject to applicable cure provisions. We may also terminate the license agreement if we determine that development results or market dynamics do not justify further development or commercialization of licensed products, in which case, all patent and technology rights shall revert to Rose U and we will (1) grant Rose U a perpetual nonexclusive license to any improvements owned by us related to the Rose U intellectual property that have been applied to or used with our hyperhidrosis program, at a royalty rate to be mutually agreed through good faith negotiation, and (2) for 120 days after such termination, assist and cooperate with Rose U (at Rose U’s expense) in connection with the license of such improvements to Rose U. Rose U may terminate the license in certain circumstances if we experience certain insolvency events or if we commit a material breach of the license agreement or if we cause Rose U to be in material breach of its license agreement with Stiefel, subject in each case to applicable cure provisions. Subject to earlier termination, the license agreement remains in effect until 15 years following the first commercial sale of a licensed product have elapsed or, if later, the date that the last patent or patent application in the licensed patent rights has expired or been revoked, invalidated or abandoned. The last‑to‑expire issued patent that we licensed under the license agreement with Rose U expires in 2029.
 Agreements with Maruho
 In March 2013, we entered into a Right of First Negotiation Agreement with Maruho (“Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement”), pursuant to which we provided Maruho with certain information and the right to negotiate an exclusive license to develop and commercialize certain of our products in specified territories. In connection with the entry into this agreement, Maruho paid us $10.0 million (“Maruho Payment”), which will be credited against certain payments payable by Maruho to us if we enter into a license agreement for any of our products with Maruho. Maruho’s right of first negotiation expired in December 2016 but the right to credit the Maruho Payment against certain payments under any future license agreement for our products remains.
 In connection with the execution of the Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement, Maruho purchased 1,187,014 shares of our Series B convertible preferred stock in March 2013 for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million. As of December 31, 2017, Maruho owned approximately 2.8% of our outstanding capital stock.
 In September 2016, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Maruho, which grants Maruho an exclusive license to develop and commercialize glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of hyperhidrosis in Japan (“Maruho G.T. Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Maruho G.T. Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $25.0 million from Maruho in October 2016 and are eligible to receive additional payments totaling up to $70.0 million, contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones associated with submission and approval of a marketing application in Japan and certain sales thresholds, as well as royalty payments based on a percentage of net product sales in Japan. The Maruho G.T. Agreement further provides that Maruho will be responsible for funding all development and commercial costs for the program in Japan and, until such time, if any, as Maruho elects to establish its own source of supply of drug product, Maruho will purchase product supply from us for development and, if applicable, commercial purposes at cost. The Maruho G.T. Agreement is unrelated to, and the exclusive license of glycopyrronium tosylate in Japan to Maruho was not subject to the terms of, the Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement. 
 26

Unless earlier terminated, the Maruho G.T. Agreement will remain in effect until the later of: (1) expiration or abandonment of the last valid claim of the applicable patent rights in Japan; (2) expiration of any market exclusivity in Japan granted by the applicable regulatory authority; and (3) 15 years following the date of the first commercial sale of the drug product in Japan.
 Agreement with Roche
 In August 2017, we entered into the Roche Agreement pursuant to which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab, an injectable, humanized antibody targeting IL-13, for atopic dermatitis and all other indications, except Roche retains certain rights, including exclusive rights to develop and promote lebrikizumab in the Retained Field, and rights to use lebrikizumab for internal research purposes and for in vitro diagnostic purposes. The Roche Agreement became effective in September 2017 upon the early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Unless earlier terminated, the Roche Agreement will remain in effect until no royalty or other payment obligations are or may become due.
 Under the terms of the Roche Agreement, we made an initial payment of $80.0 million to Roche in October 2017 and will make additional payments to Roche in 2018 totaling $55.0 million. We will also be obligated to make payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, comprising $40.0 million upon the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical study, up to $210.0 million upon the achievement of regulatory and first commercial sale milestones in certain territories and up to $1.0 billion based on the achievement of certain thresholds for net sales of lebrikizumab for indications other than interstitial lung diseases. Upon regulatory approval, if obtained, we will make royalty payments representing percentages of net sales that range from the high single-digits to the high teens. Royalty payments will be made from the first commercial sale date in a country (other than for the Retained Field) in such country and end on the later of the date that is (a) ten years after the date of the first commercial sale of lebrikizumab (other than for the Retained Field) in such country, (b) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the applicable licensed compound patent rights, Dermira patent rights or joint patent rights in such country covering the use, manufacturing, import, offering for sale, or sale of lebrikizumab (other than for the Retained Field) in such country, (c) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the applicable licensed non-compound patent rights in such country covering the use, import, offering for sale, or sale of the product in such country, or (d) the expiration of the last to expire regulatory exclusivity conferred by the applicable regulatory authority in such country for lebrikizumab (other than for the Retained Field).
 Collaboration with UCB
 In March 2014, we and UCB Pharma S.A. (“UCB”), entered into a Development and Commercialisation Agreement, dated March 21, 2014 (“UCB Agreement”), which provided that we would (a) develop Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) for the treatment of psoriasis in order for UCB to seek regulatory approval from the FDA, the European Medicines Agency and the Canadian federal department for health, and (b) upon the grant of regulatory approval in the United States and Canada, promote sales of Cimzia to dermatologists and conduct related medical affairs activities in the United States and Canada. 
 The UCB Agreement also provided either party with the right to terminate the agreement under certain terms. We expressed our intent to terminate the UCB Agreement in accordance with its terms. As a result, we and UCB entered into an agreement on November 6, 2017 to effect the termination of the UCB Agreement and an orderly transition of the development and commercialization activities under the UCB Agreement from us to UCB (“Transition Agreement”). The Transition Agreement, among other things, (a) terminated the UCB Agreement on February 15, 2018, (b) provided for the repurchase by UCB of all product rights, licenses and intellectual property relating to Cimzia, (c) specified the responsibilities and obligations of us and UCB in connection with the transition of certain activities under the UCB Agreement from us to UCB as a result of the termination of the UCB Agreement, (d) terminated UCB’s right to designate a director nominee to our board of directors and (e) provided for the resignation of UCB’s designee from our board of directors.
 Pursuant to the UCB Agreement, there were no termination or penalty payments required by either party. In consideration for the repurchase of all product rights, licenses and intellectual property relating to Cimzia, UCB paid us $11.0 million in November 2017 and, upon approval of Cimzia in psoriasis in the United States, will pay us an 
 27

additional $39.0 million within 30 days of such approval. We are obligated to reimburse UCB for up to $10.0 million of development costs incurred by UCB in connection with the development of Cimzia between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018. If the aggregate development costs reimbursed by us to UCB during this six-month period are less than $10.0 million, we will pay UCB the difference between such aggregate costs and $10.0 million. These terms replace the provisions of the UCB Agreement pursuant to which we would have been eligible to recoup our external development costs incurred related to the Cimzia program, net of milestones received, through a royalty on future net sales of Cimzia. The $10.0 million payable to UCB is recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as refund liability. The $1.0 million net consideration from the $11.0 million payment received from UCB and the $10.0 million refund liability due to UCB will be recognized as revenue over the period in which we are obligated to perform transition services pursuant to the Transition Agreement.
 Government Regulation
 FDA Drug Approval Process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. As a result of these regulations, pharmaceutical product development and approval are very expensive and time consuming.
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well‑ controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre‑market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. For dermatology products, Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine metabolism, pharmacokinetics, the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit‑risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases the FDA requires two adequate and well‑controlled Phase 3 clinical trials with statistically significant results to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of an effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 After completion of the required activities, including clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States.
 28

The FDA also may refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with the FDA’s good clinical practice requirements. Additionally, the FDA typically inspects the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured, and may inspect the sponsor company and investigator sites that participated in the clinical trials. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective for the stated indication.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction following FDA review of a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”), to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post‑approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA generally uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
 Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA filed under section 505(b)(1) of the FDC Act. An alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA (“505(b)(2) NDA”), which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application.
 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant.

Biologics
 Biological products used for the prevention, treatment or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), via a Biologics License Application (“BLA”). However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs and BLA supplements, including review timelines, are very similar to those for NDAs and NDA supplements, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as other drugs.
 Post‑Approval Requirements
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post‑approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post‑approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct‑to‑consumer advertising, off‑label promotion, industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post‑marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality‑control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality‑control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”) provides NDA holders a six‑month extension of any exclusivity, patent or non‑patent, for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA‑regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of our programs.
 30

Regulation Outside of the United States
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to regulations of other countries in which our clinical trials or commercial sales are conducted. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. Regulatory authorities in certain countries outside of the United States have a process similar to the FDA’s that requires the submission of a clinical trial application (“CTA”), much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and institutional review board, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, orphan (rare) diseases, viral diseases or diabetes and is optional for those medicines which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization from one state may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 Anti‑Kickback, False Claims Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, among others, anti‑kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. The federal healthcare program anti‑kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended (“PPACA”), amended the intent element of the federal anti‑kickback statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.
Other Federal and State Regulatory Requirements
 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has issued a final rule pursuant to PPACA that requires certain manufacturers of prescription drugs to annually collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers were required to begin collecting information on August 1, 2013, with the first reports due March 31, 2014. The reported data is posted in searchable form on a public website maintained by CMS. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.
 31

In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners and entities in these states. Other states prohibit various other marketing‑related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Some of the state laws are broader in scope than federal laws. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.
 Reimbursement
 Sales of any of our product candidates that are approved will depend, in part, on how our products are managed by third‑party payers, such as commercial insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers and government health programs. Third‑party payers are responsible for managing overall pharmaceutical drug spending for their client membership and can employ a variety of means – including excluding a medicine from a formulary – to help control patient utilization. Third-party payers and their employer clients may also require patients to pay a high percentage of the list price of a medicine, which has been shown to negatively impact adherence to chronic medicines.  
 Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of the federal and state governments, and efforts to manage the prices of drugs have been a component of this effort. The U.S. federal government (including Congress), state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost‑containment programs, including price controls, demonstration of cost effectiveness versus standard of care with specified models, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for mandatory substitution of therapeutically similar generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost‑containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results of operation. If any of our products are approved and these third‑party payers do not consider our approved products to be clinically superior or cost‑effective compared to therapeutically similar therapies, they may not cover our approved products in their formularies, or, if covered, the amount of patient cost-sharing could deter initiation and/or subsequent adherence, which would affect our net profitability.
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D of the MMA, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand‑alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our approved products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers may follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage policies. Any denials in coverage or high beneficiary cost-sharing that results from the MMA may result in similar treatment from non‑governmental payers.
 32

The PPACA, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively “ACA”), enacted in March 2010, had a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA expanded coverage for the uninsured, while at the same time implementing measures to contain overall healthcare costs. We cannot predict the impact of the ACA on pharmaceutical companies, as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, which has not yet occurred. Moreover, although the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of most of the ACA, some states have indicated that they intend to not implement certain sections of the ACA and the current presidential administration and certain members of the majority of the U.S. Congress have sought to repeal all or part of the ACA and implement a replacement program. For example, the so-called “individual mandate” was repealed as part of tax reform legislation adopted in December 2017, such that the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, will be eliminated beginning in 2019.
 In addition, in some non‑U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, product candidates launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States, and prices in the European Union generally tend to be significantly lower.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We currently contract with third parties for the manufacture of our drug substances and drug products for preclinical studies and clinical trials and intend to continue doing so in the future. We have assembled a team of experienced employees and consultants to provide the necessary technical, quality and regulatory oversight over the contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) with which we contract. We rely on third‑party manufacturers for scale‑up and process development work and to produce sufficient quantities of development product candidates for use in clinical and preclinical trials. We currently have development contracts and quality agreements with several CMOs for the manufacturing of our drug substances and drug products. We anticipate that these CMOs will have capacity to support commercial scale, but we do not have any formal agreements at this time with any of these CMOs to cover commercial production. We also may elect to pursue other CMOs for manufacturing supplies for later‑stage trials and for commercialization. Pursuant to the terms of the Roche Agreement, Roche is responsible for the manufacture and supply to us of lebrikizumab drug substance. Subject to certain requirements, Roche has the right to transfer its manufacture and supply responsibilities to us at any time. 
Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 162 regular full‑time employees, including 79 in research and development. From time to time, we also retain independent contractors to support our organization. Our employees are not represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
