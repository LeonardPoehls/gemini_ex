Item 1. Business. 
Unless otherwise expressly indicated in this Item 1, the discussions set forth herein are as of December 31, 2016. The “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” when used in this report refers to Cambium Learning Group, Inc. and its predecessors and consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. 
Overview 
Cambium Learning® Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in 2009 and is a leading educational solutions and services company that is committed to helping all students reach their full potential. Our award-winning brands include: Learning A-Z® (www.learninga-z.com), Voyager Sopris Learning® (www.voyagersopris.com), ExploreLearning® (www.explorelearning.com) and Kurzweil Education® (www.kurzweiledu.com), which, together, provide breakthrough technology solutions for students and teachers, including best-in-class intervention and supplemental instructional programs; gold-standard professional development; valid and reliable assessments; and products that enable access to learning for all students. The following core beliefs form the foundation of our value proposition:

• | Every learner has untapped potential. Our solutions recognize that each student has a unique and multitudinous background that he or she brings to the classroom, which is why our programs provide individualized learning paths and personalized learning environments that honor and build from where a student’s academic journey begins.


• | Teachers are the foundation—their importance must be valued. We believe that the biggest contributing factor to a student’s success in school is the presence of a knowledgeable and caring teacher, so our curriculum trainings, professional development, and consulting services promote a true partnership that is flexible to unique needs.


• | Data, instruction, and practice drive improvement. The unique capabilities afforded through technology give teachers and students more agility—easily enabling them to not only adapt, engage, mobilize, and move learning beyond the classroom walls, but also to quantify progress, respond to data trends, and individualize instruction like never before.

Our company builds products upon these foundational beliefs, which are aligned with market needs. Proof of this market alignment is demonstrated, in part, by the awards and accolades that we continued to receive throughout 2016 from a variety of industry publications.

With a comprehensive and blended approach, Learning A-Z delivers the tools students need to become college- and career-ready without limiting a teacher's ability to differentiate instruction as they see fit. Learning A-Z’s approach to literacy emphasizes knowledge and individual potential by recognizing that while reading and writing remain essential to attaining academic success, they are dynamic and dependent on real-world application and the incorporation of many other 21st century skills. Students today must read and write well, and they must also be able to think critically and analyze what they learn, solve problems, innovate and apply creativity, utilize advancing technology, communicate effectively orally and in writing, and collaborate with their peers. With a robust library of incredibly effective and flexible curriculum resources, Learning A-Z provides the tools teachers need to deliver personalized instruction for a wide range of student needs.

The product also delivers a set of eLearning tools students can use to practice their creative and process writing skills and submit assignments to their teacher online. Writing A-Z supports educators in teaching early emergent writers critical writing fundamentals, and more established writers the processes and skills they need to become college and career ready. 
Vocabulary A-Z is an online resource that helps educators easily incorporate vocabulary into day-to-day instruction. The web site offers hundreds of resources and contains over 15,000 student-centric words to help make teaching vocabulary in the classroom effective, easy, and fun. Teachers can quickly create their own custom word lists with auto-generated five-day lesson plans and assessments or can choose from a collection of pre-made lists and lessons that include standards-based academic vocabulary, Dolch sight words, Marzano word lists, and high-frequency words. Lessons are designed to teach words based on context and meaning, not memorization, and support an array of subject-based units in grades K-6.
ReadyTest A-Z is an online resource that prepares students for success on high-stakes English language arts assessments. With the collection of teacher-led test-taking lessons and grade-appropriate practice tests, students and educators have the tools they need to develop students' close reading skills, improve testing self-confidence, strengthen test-taking stamina, and complete performance tasks, technology items, and constructed response.

Voyager Sopris Learning Segment
The Voyager Sopris Learning segment includes our Voyager Sopris Learning and Kurzweil Education brands.
Voyager Sopris Learning Brand

It has built a nearly 40-year legacy on research and data-based curriculum development, while remaining nimble and responsive to the shifts and changes required by new standards, more demanding and rigorous content, new and competitive technological capabilities, and the needs of educators today. On a daily basis, Voyager Sopris Learning listens to the challenges of teachers and students, and its products are designed to respond to the need for exciting intervention and supplemental curricula that engage students, while remaining 
6

100% purpose- and data-driven in their delivery. Voyager Sopris Learning programs are steeped in research and evidence, but they are also built with a deep consideration and understanding of the realities and struggles of education today. 
Voyager Sopris Learning Solutions
LANGUAGE! Live, authored by renowned literacy expert Louisa Moats, Ed.D., is a comprehensive literacy solution that combines teacher-directed learning with personalized interactive instruction in an online social environment. In light of the more rigorous standards and assessments, the ultimate goal of LANGUAGE! Live is to quickly advance grades 5-12 students to grade-level performance in literacy. It was designed with a carefully scaffolded learning progression intended to meet the high expectations of state standards. Engaging student-directed technology drives instruction and builds foundational skills, while teacher-directed learning hones in on more advanced literacy skills. LANGUAGE! Live takes the best of more than two decades of research and instructional program development to the next level with cutting-edge, next generation online peer collaboration, gamification, and social media. While LANGUAGE! Live is based on the effective research-driven instructional sequences and strategies of its proven-effective predecessor LANGUAGE!, it places a greater emphasis on deep text analysis, vocabulary, and a thorough focus on higher-order thinking skills.
Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling (LETRS®), authored also by Louisa Moats, Ed.D., is the expertly designed professional development solution for educators who are responsible for teaching and improving PreK-12 instruction in reading, writing, and spelling. Beyond the routines and lesson plans of adopted reading programs, it is important that educators understand the language structures they are teaching, how students learn to read and write, and the reasons some children struggle. LETRS gives teachers this knowledge while addressing each component of reading instruction-phonemic awareness, phonics and word study, oral language, vocabulary, reading fluency and automaticity, comprehension, assessment, and writing. Through LETRS, teachers and reading coaches gain a deeper understanding of language structure and how to help struggling readers. LETRS and the national cadre of expert trainers, all of whom were once educators, help teachers apply best practice in teaching reading in the classroom every day.
Step Up to Writing®, authored by writing instructional expert Maureen Auman, M.A., is a highly flexible writing program that provides research-based, hands-on, multisensory writing strategies and writing activities that help students become proficient in the areas of informative/explanatory; narrative and personal narrative; and opinion/argument writing. These strategies foster development of critical thinking, reading comprehension, and listening and speaking skills. Step Up to Writing helps establish writing as a process rather than as an end product. Its current edition has been remastered to meet the rigor of the college and career readiness standards, while maintaining the same evidence-proven explicit instruction and workshop approach that has engaged diverse groups of students and improved their writing skills for years. Every Step Up to Writing strategy is built to support specific standards in the areas of writing, language, reading, and speaking and listening.
TransMath®, authored by mathematics expert John Woodward, Ph.D., is a comprehensive, skill-based mathematics intervention program developed specifically for students in grades 5-10 who are two or more years behind in math on standardized grade level tests and lack the necessary skills for successful entry into algebra. The program is an intensive support for the remediation and acceleration of middle and high school students, including students in special education, who are experiencing academic difficulties in the area of math. TransMath’s explicit and systematic instruction addresses students’ gaps in procedural fluency, conceptual understanding, strategic competence, adaptive reasoning, and productive disposition. TransMath incorporates robust, integrated technology components and engaging visual representations to support differentiated learning needs.
VelocityTM is a K-5 supplemental literacy intervention and the next generation in adaptive instruction-transforming the classroom and empowering both students and teachers like no other program. Each Velocity student embarks on a learning path that is unique to his or her skills and abilities, meaning no two students will have the same experience. Velocity functions as an extension of the teacher’s presence in the classroom—by continually monitoring each student’s understanding of skills, instantly adjusting lessons to make them more effective for each individual, and then provides actionable insights to the teacher in order to make the most of instructional time. Velocity has been acknowledged by prestigious industry organizations as a program that supports students who are at risk of not attaining grade-level expectations.

Kurzweil Education Brand
Kurzweil Education offers proven, research-based solutions that enable students to address their own unique learning challenges and build the skills—and the confidence—to succeed. With the support of Kurzweil programs, students become independent, confident learners who can achieve rigorous academic goals. When learners are able to understand text on demand, use organizational and content management tools to jumpstart their written work, and demonstrate their knowledge, they can demonstrate their true potential. Kurzweil Education's Universal Design for Learning (UDL) technologies enable striving learners to read, comprehend, synthesize, apply, and demonstrate their knowledge. Students who benefit from Kurzweil technologies include students with dyslexia and dysgraphia, English Language Learners (ELLs), students in Special Education, Veterans, and the blind or visually impaired.
Kurzweil Education Solutions
Kurzweil 3000 (k3000) is a reading, writing, and learning software for an array of students who struggle. Widely recognized as the most comprehensive and integrated solution for addressing language and literacy difficulties, k3000 embraces and supports the concept of UDL by making print and electronic material available to a broad spectrum of students. k3000 uses a multisensory approach—presenting print or electronic text on the computer screen with added visual and auditory accessibility. It incorporates a host of dynamic features (including powerful decoding, study skills, and test taking tools) designed to support each individual’s learning style and promote active learning. For students who have difficulty physically accessing curriculum materials, it provides a digital means of engaging with text and supports students who use alternative methods for accessing the computer. k3000 allows students with disabilities to access the regular education curriculum, and the software’s versatility allows school districts to meet a variety of students’ learning needs using just one program—regardless of the grade level or curriculum area.
Kurzweil 1000™ is a scan and read software that makes printed or electronic text accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired. Combining traditional reading machine technologies—such as scanning, image processing, and text-to-speech, with communication and productivity tools—eases and enhances users’ reading, writing and learning experiences. Documents and digital files are converted from text-to-speech and read aloud in a variety of natural-sounding voices that can be modified to individual preferences. Additionally, this software enables users to write and edit documents, and it assists with note taking, summarizing content, and outlining text.
ExploreLearning Segment
ExploreLearning develops STEM-based curriculum tools that demonstrate how math and science fields are alive, useful, and shaping the future. To convey that each student can become a mathematician or scientist, as well as demonstrate the true practical applicability of these fields, ExploreLearning creates solutions that cultivate student confidence and enthusiasm through engaged interaction. ExploreLearning has two products that augment core instruction in the classroom and build procedural and conceptual understanding: Gizmos for grades 3-12 and Reflex for grades 2-8. Gizmos is a large library of interactive, online simulations of math and science concepts that enable infinite “what-if” exploration. Reflex is a math fact fluency builder that offers a truly adaptive approach to the fast and automatic recall of math facts—shoring up students’ working memory for more complex math problems.
ExploreLearning Solutions
Gizmos brings the power of inquiry—and STEM-based learning—to teachers and students in grades 3-12. Gizmos helps teachers take advantage of research-proven instructional strategies and enables students of all ability levels to develop conceptual understanding in math and science. With more than 400 Gizmos at their disposal, teachers can supplement and enhance instruction with interactive visualizations of mathematics and science concepts. Students can manipulate key variables, generate and test hypotheses, and engage in extensive “what-if” experimentation. Gizmos are designed to promote exploration, experimentation, and discovery in math and science. Unlike other products, most Gizmos are open-ended, which means students are free to manipulate variables, run experiments, and look for patterns. The lesson materials provided with Gizmos are customizable and follow a “structured inquiry” approach, with the goal of allowing students to figure out relationships on their own—students become active learners rather than passive recipients of information.
Reflex is an adaptive online solution that helps students in grades 2-8 develop math fact fluency—the quick and effortless (automatic) recall of basic math facts. By enabling students to effortlessly and quickly recall math facts, students free up working memory, enabling them to tackle more complex problems. Traditional methods of teaching math fact fluency, such 
8

as worksheets and flash cards, are not effective for many students because these methods are not individualized. They do not adapt to what students know and do not create a customized approach for every child—not to mention, worksheets and flashcards are not motivating and can reduce math to drudgery. Reflex efficiently moves students to fluency by continuously engaging, adapting, and individualizing instruction, thereby creating an optimal experience for every student. The program also provides educators with intuitive and powerful reporting that helps them effectively monitor and support student progress. For students, Reflex utilizes engaging, fast-paced games and rewards them for effort and progress, creating a compelling, motivational environment to support student achievement.
Industry Information 
We sell primarily to public school districts in the United States. On a smaller scale, we also sell to private and charter schools, teachers, home school and parent consumers, and other companies that bundle our products with their offerings. Most of our public school district customers are largely dependent on state and local funding to purchase our products. School districts also use funding through federal education programs. Third party estimates attribute roughly 10% of school district funding from federal sources, with the larger portion split approximately equally between state and local sources. While we do not collect funding source data from our customers, management believes these estimates are reflective of our school district customer base.
The education market has been impacted by the adoption of rigorous state standards designed to ensure students obtain the skills and knowledge in their K-12 education careers to graduate high school able to succeed in entry-level, credit-bearing academic college courses and in workforce training programs. Common Core State Standards were designed to establish a single set of clear educational standards throughout the country for grades K-12. While Common Core State Standards have become a political issue with states both for and against Common Core, almost all states are moving toward more rigorous standards. We believe schools and districts will augment and replace instructional materials to align to the new standards and to prepare students for assessments measuring progress against the new rigorous standards.
Additionally, the digitalization of education content and delivery is driving a substantial shift in the education market. Schools and districts are demanding more effective solutions, and technology solutions have the potential to increase effectiveness by personalizing and individualizing instruction. The demand for such products has developed rapidly over the past several years and has led to changes in the way that providers develop, produce, market, and distribute products.
We believe that demand for our products and professional services will be driven by an increased emphasis on accountability and measurement. There is greater emphasis on evaluating educators based on the performance of their students; regulatory frameworks have mandated stricter accountability, higher standards, and increased transparency in education; and states have been required to measure annual progress towards these standards and make results publicly available. We believe that with more attention to student progress, increased analysis of U.S. student outcomes versus other countries, and movement to adopt more rigorous standards, such as the Common Core State Standards, the number of children deemed to need differentiated products for unique student needs is likely to increase.
We believe our strategic plans are aligned to these market trends.
Competition 
The market for our products is highly competitive and fragmented. Competition varies by segment and product line but typically comes from large publishers covering a broad array of products, smaller providers who specialize in very limited areas, and free or open-source teacher and student resources. Below are examples of competitors by segment.

• | Learning A-Z competitors include Curriculum Associates’ i-Ready, Francisco Partners' myON, and Renaissance’s Accelerated Reader.


• | Voyager Sopris Learning competitors include traditional and supplemental curriculum suppliers, including Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Pearson, McGraw-Hill Education, Curriculum Associates, and Lexia, with the Kurzweil Education product lines competing against suppliers such as Don Johnston and TextHelp’s Read+Write.


• | ExploreLearning competitors include Scholastic’s FASTT Math, Penda Learning, and PhET.

Seasonality
Our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to a number of factors, including the academic school year, school procurement policies, funding cycles, new products and the amount and timing of spending patterns. Our first quarter historically represents less than 15% of Bookings, which tend to build through the second quarter and peak during the third quarter, since school districts complete most of their purchases around the start of a new school year.

Product Development, Marketing, and Sales
We are strategically focused on ensuring that our product offerings are the most effective at helping students reach their full potential, and that our sales and marketing forces can effectively and efficiently deliver our educational solutions. Each segment has its own development, marketing, and sales teams to better address the unique market position and target customer of its products.
Product Development
We seek to take advantage of new product and technology opportunities and view product development to be essential to maintaining and growing our market position. Product development expenditures may be incurred to incorporate the latest research or pedagogy, bring images current, or update factual content, or to develop variations, expansions (e.g., more grade levels) or other enhancements of our products. We are focusing our development efforts on technology-enabled subscription solutions and expect sales of our purely print-based products to continue to decline. Our online subscription products are enhanced continuously. 
Changing educational standards also provide opportunities to meet new market needs. The continued implementation of these standards is likely to result in an increase in the number of students that are deemed to be below grade level proficiency. Products that are aligned with the Common Core or other rigorous state standards will allow educators to focus on areas where students are not proficient as each lesson will be clearly tied to the required learning objectives. 
Research and development expense, net of capitalization, was $12.9 million and $10.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We capitalize product development costs associated with internal-use software, which includes software as a service offered to our customers with an online subscription, as well as certain pre-publication, production, and online curriculum development expenditures. Capitalized product development costs were as follows by segment in 2016:

• | Learning A-Z – $7.5 million


• | Voyager Sopris Learning – $7.4 million


• | ExploreLearning – $2.4 million

Sales and Marketing 
Our sales force includes both field sales producers, who generally cover districts with larger student enrollment, and an inside sales force, which generally covers smaller territories. Our sales representatives are supported by product or subject matter and implementation experts as well as a marketing team. All of our segments, and Learning A-Z in particular, are increasingly making use of e-commerce and the Internet to sell our products. We have and will continue to participate in state adoptions and requests for proposals when our products meet the needs of these procurement initiatives. As of December 31, 2016, our total combined company sales force employees consisted of 63 field and 58 inside sales representatives for a total of 121 direct sales producers, excluding sales management and marketing. We often use resellers for international sales and also use a small number of independent sales representatives. Sales and marketing expense was $47.2 million and $44.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Concentration Risk 
We are not overly dependent upon any one customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. We have a broad customer base; in the two years ended December 31, 2016, on a consolidated basis, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total net revenues in any one year. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 10% of our total net revenues in 2016. 
Governmental Regulations 
Our operations are governed by laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection for education and student information, equal employment opportunity, workplace safety, information privacy, and worker health, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations under that Act. Additionally, as a company that often bids on various state, local and federally funded programs, we are subject to various governmental procurement policies and regulations. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations and we believe that future compliance will not have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated operations or financial condition.
