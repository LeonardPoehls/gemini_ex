Verizon Merger Agreement
 
On May 11, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“the Verizon Merger Agreement”) with Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”), a Delaware corporation, and Waves Merger Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Verizon Merger Agreement, among other things, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”) with the Company being the surviving corporation of the Merger.
 
At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company and each share of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (collectively, the “Shares”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Verizon, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect subsidiary of Verizon, and Shares owned by us or any our direct or indirect subsidiaries, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties) will be converted into the right to receive a number of validly issued, fully paid in and nonassessable shares of common stock of Verizon (“Verizon Shares”) equal to the quotient determined by dividing $184.00 by the five (5)-day volume-weighted average per share price ending on the second full trading day prior to the Effective Time, rounded to two decimal points, of Verizon Shares on the New York Stock Exchange (the “Verizon Share Value”) and rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share (collectively and in the aggregate, the “Merger Consideration”). It is our intention that (i) the Merger shall qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) the Verizon Merger Agreement shall constitute a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g), as noted in the Verizon Merger Agreement.
 
Our board of directors (the “Board”) has unanimously approved the Verizon Merger Agreement and determined that the Verizon Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and our stockholders, and recommended that our stockholders approve the Verizon Merger Agreement.
 
We agreed, subject to certain exceptions with respect to unsolicited proposals, not to directly or indirectly solicit competing acquisition proposals or to participate in any discussions concerning, or provide non-public information in connection with, any unsolicited acquisition proposals.
 
On August 2, 2017, we held a special meeting of our stockholders to vote on a proposal to adopt the Verizon Merger Agreement. At such meeting, the proposal to adopt the Verizon Merger Agreement was approved with 89% of the votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting voting; and of the votes cast, approximately 99% of the votes cast in favor of the proposal to adopt the Verizon Merger Agreement. That approval terminated the Board’s ability to consider unsolicited acquisition proposals, change its recommendation of the Merger, and terminate the Verizon Merger Agreement in connection therewith. 
 
The completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including:
 
(i) receipt of regulatory approvals, including receipt of consent to the Merger from the FCC and the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (“HSR”); (ii) there being no law or injunction prohibiting consummation of the transactions contemplated under the Verizon Merger Agreement; (iii) the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the Merger; (iv) subject to specified materiality standards, the continuing accuracy of certain representations and warranties of each party; (v) continued compliance by each party in all material respects with its covenants; (vi) no event having occurred that has had, or would reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Verizon Merger Agreement) on us; (vii) receipt by us an opinion from its tax counsel to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a “reorganization” for United States federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; (viii) receipt of approval for listing the Verizon Shares on the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ Global Select Market, subject to official notice of issuance; and (ix) the FCC consent referred to in clause (ii) of this paragraph having become a Final Order (as defined in the Verizon Merger Agreement).
 
We and Verizon filed notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice on May 19, 2017. The HSR Act waiting period expired on June 19, 2017, and the condition for HSR Act clearance was satisfied.

On June 1, 2017, we and Verizon submitted applications to the FCC seeking consent to transfer control of our spectrum licenses to Verizon. For further discussion, please see Item 3 to Part 1 “Legal Proceedings” in this Annual Report.
 
We have made customary representations and warranties in the Verizon Merger Agreement. The Verizon Merger Agreement also contains customary covenants and agreements, including covenants and agreements relating to the conduct of our business between the date of the signing of the Verizon Merger Agreement and the closing of the transactions contemplated under the Verizon Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties made by us are qualified by disclosures made in our disclosure schedules and Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings. None of the representations and warranties in the Verizon Merger Agreement survive the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Verizon Merger Agreement. 
 
The Verizon Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and Verizon including upon (i) an uncured breach by the other party which results in the failure of a closing condition, (ii) the failure to receive the approval of the Verizon Merger Agreement by our stockholders, and (iii) our Board changing its recommendation in favor of the Verizon Merger Agreement. The Verizon Merger Agreement further provides that, upon termination of the Verizon Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances following a change in recommendation by us in connection with our receipt of a superior proposal or due to an Intervening Event (as defined in the Verizon Merger Agreement), we may be required to pay Verizon a termination fee equal to $38 million. As a result of the adoption of the Verizon Merger Agreement at the special meeting of our stockholders on August 2, 2017, we never owed the termination fee to Verizon. Either we or Verizon may terminate the Verizon Merger Agreement if the closing of the Merger has not occurred on or before February 12, 2018 (as it may be extended as provided below, the “Termination Date”); provided, however, that if regulatory approvals have not been obtained and all other conditions to closing have been satisfied or waived, the Termination Date will automatically be extended for an additional one hundred and eighty days. In addition, Verizon is required to pay us an aggregate amount equal to $85 million (the “Parent Termination Fee”) in the event that the Merger has not closed by the extended Termination Date, and all conditions to closing other than receipt of FCC consent or HSR approval (or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR) have been satisfied or waived. In the event that the Verizon Merger Agreement is terminated other than as a result of Verizon’s breach or under circumstances in which Verizon is required to pay the Parent Termination Fee, we will be required to pay Verizon an amount equal to the AT&T Termination Fee (as defined in the Verizon Merger Agreement) paid by Verizon on our behalf. 
 
The Verizon Merger Agreement was attached as Exhibit 2.1 to the Form 8-K filed by us with the SEC on May 11, 2017 to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about us, Verizon or Merger Sub, or to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about us or Verizon in their public reports filed with the SEC. The Verizon Merger Agreement includes representations, warranties and covenants of us, Verizon and Merger Sub made solely for purposes of the Verizon Merger Agreement and which may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by us, Verizon and Merger Sub in connection with the negotiated terms of the Verizon Merger Agreement. Moreover, some of those representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to our or Verizon’s SEC filings or may have been used for purposes of allocating risk among the us, Verizon and Merger Sub rather than establishing matters as facts. 
 
The foregoing summary of the Verizon Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Verizon Merger Agreement, which was attached as Exhibit 2.1 to the Form 8-K filed by us with the SEC on May 11, 2017, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
In addition, Howard Jonas, who has the right to vote a majority of the voting power of our common stock entered into a voting agreement with Verizon concurrently with the entry into the Verizon Merger Agreement (the “Voting Agreement”). The Voting Agreement provides that Mr. Jonas (holding his Class A shares through a trust) will vote his Class A shares in the Company in favor of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated in the Verizon Merger Agreement, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Voting Agreement. The Voting Agreement will terminate automatically upon the earliest to occur of (i) the effective time of the Merger, (ii) the valid termination of the Verizon Merger Agreement pursuant to Article VII thereof, (iii) a change of recommendation by the Board in the event of a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, (iv) any change being made to the terms of the Verizon Merger Agreement that would terminate the Trust’s or Mr. Jonas’s obligation to vote in favor of the Merger (on the terms and subject to the conditions in the Verizon Merger Agreement) or (v) February 12, 2018. We are not a party to the Voting Agreement. At the special meeting held on August 2, 2017, Mr. Jonas voted his shares in the Company in favor of the Merger.
 
The foregoing summary of the Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the form of Voting Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit A to the Verizon Merger Agreement, which was attached as Exhibit 2.1 to the Form 8-K filed by us with the SEC on May 11, 2017 and is incorporated herein by reference.

On May 11, 2017, the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 9, 2017, by and among the Company, AT&T Inc. and Switchback Merger Sub Inc. (the “AT&T Merger Agreement”) was terminated in its entirety by us pursuant to the terms and conditions of the AT&T Merger Agreement. Also on May 11, 2017, Verizon paid to AT&T, on our behalf, the $38 million Company Termination Fee (as defined in the AT&T Merger Agreement) concurrently with the termination of the AT&T Merger Agreement pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof.
 
Under the Verizon Merger Agreement, we have agreed to take certain actions intended to facilitate the consummation of the Merger, including but not limited to preparation of SEC filings, calling of stockholder meeting and the making of certain required regulatory filings. In addition, we must maintain our FCC licenses and comply with all regulatory requirements, including requirements under a consent decree with the FCC (see discussion below). We will also be seeking to enter into definitive agreements and effectuate the previously disclosed settlement with IDT, including the transfer of our interest in Straight Path IP Group, subject to certain retained rights to proceeds from licensing and similar arrangement.
 
We have agreed with Verizon, except as provided in the Verizon Merger Agreement, to operate its business in the ordinary course and maintain its business, its licenses and relationships. However, we are restricted from taking certain actions that would be inconsistent with the intent of the Verizon Merger Agreement as more fully described in that agreement. Accordingly, we will be focused on satisfying the conditions to the completion of the Merger and will not be seeking to expand its leasing or other Spectrum business operations.
 
FCC Regulatory Enforcement
 
On January 11, 2017, we entered into a consent decree with the FCC settling the FCC’s investigation regarding Straight Path Spectrum’s spectrum licenses (the “Consent Decree”). Material terms of the Consent Decree include the following:

1. | The FCC agreed to terminate its investigation. 
---+---------------------------------------------------


2. | Straight Path Spectrum agreed to surrender 93 of its 828 39 GHz economic area spectrum licenses to the FCC, as well as 103 rectangular service area licenses that the we do not believe were material assets of the Company. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Straight Path Spectrum will keep all of its 28 GHz spectrum licenses. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Straight Path Spectrum is barred from entering into any new leases of its spectrum. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | We agreed to pay a $15 million civil penalty (the “Initial Civil Penalty”) in four installments as follows - $4 million on or before February 11, 2017; $4 million on or before April 11, 2017; $3.5 million on or before July 11, 2017; and $3.5 million on or before October 11, 2017. If we sell our remaining spectrum licenses (see below) prior to the due date of any installation payment, any remaining installation payments will become due on the date of such closing. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | We agreed to submit to the FCC an application for approval of the sale of its remaining 39 GHz and 28 GHz spectrum licenses on or before January 11, 2018 and pay the FCC 20% of the proceeds from such the sale(s). 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | If we do not submit to the FCC an application for approval of a sale of its remaining spectrum licenses on or before January 11, 2018, we will pay an additional penalty of $85 million or surrender our remaining spectrum licenses. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As the Consent Decree bars us from entering into any new leases of our spectrum, this will limit our ability to increase our leasing revenue in the future. The first three installments totaling $11.5 million were paid and the remaining $3.5 million of the Initial Civil Penalty will be paid from the proceeds of a loan agreement discussed below.

Loan Agreement
 
On February 6, 2017, we entered into a loan agreement (“Loan Agreement”) with a syndicate of investors (the “Lenders”) pursuant to which we borrowed $17.5 million (the “Loan Amount”). The loan matures on December 29, 2017. Interest accrued at a rate of 5% per annum through June 30, 2017 and then increased to a rate of 10% per annum. Other significant terms of the Loan Agreement include the following: 

1. | $15 million of the Loan Amount is to be used to pay the Initial Civil Penalty provided for in the Consent Decree in accordance with the payment requirements set forth in the Consent Decree. The remainder of the Loan Amount is being used for general corporate purposes and working capital needs. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Upon funding the Loan Amount, the Lenders received warrants to purchase 252,161 shares of our Class B common stock with an aggregate value equal to $7.5 million based on an exercise price of $34.70 per share. The exercise price was based on the weighted average trading price for the Class B common stock for the five trading days preceding the funding date. The warrants expire at the earlier of December 31, 2018 or a liquidation event (as defined). Warrants to purchase 147,682 shares of Class B common stock were exercised by the holders in the third quarter of Fiscal 2017. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | From and after June 30, 2017, the Lenders are entitled to receive additional warrants on a monthly basis with an aggregate exercise price equal to 7.5% (the rate was 10% for July 2017 and August 2017) of the then outstanding Loan Amount. The exercise price for such warrants is based on the weighted average trading price for the Class B common stock for the ten trading days preceding the warrant issue date. Under this provision, the Lenders received the following warrants: a. On July 3, 2017, the Lenders received warrants to purchase 6,899 shares of our Class B common stock with an exercise price of $179.62 per share. b. On August 1, 2017, the Lenders received warrants to purchase 6,911 shares of our Class B common stock with an exercise price of $179.26 per share. c. On September 1, 2017, the Lenders received warrants to purchase 5,188 shares of our Class B common stock with an exercise price of $179.18 per share. d. On October 2, 2017, the Lenders received warrants to purchase 5,143 shares of our Class B common stock with an exercise price of $180.48 per share. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | To the extent the warrants are held by a Lender at the time of exercise, the exercise price will be paid by the reduction of the outstanding Loan Amount. As of July 31, 2017, the Loan Amount was reduced by $5,125,000 as the result of the exercise of 147,682 warrants received by the Lenders upon making the loan. There were no additional warrant exercises for the period from August 1, 2017 to the date of the filing of this report. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | The Loan Agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in primarily all of the assets of the Company. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The outstanding Loan Balance as of October 10, 2017 was $12,375,435.
 
Settlement with IDT
 
On April 9, 2017, we and IDT entered into the IDT Term Sheet, providing for the settlement and mutual release of the potential indemnification claims asserted by each of us and IDT in connection with liabilities that may exist or arise relating to the subject matter of the investigation by (including but not limited to fines, fees or penalties imposed by) the FCC (the “Mutual Release”), and the sale of our interest in Straight Path IP Group to IDT. As of the date of the filing of this report, the parties have not yet consummated the settlement agreement and mutual release contemplated by the IDT Term Sheet. The definitive settlement agreement is under negotiation. For further discussion, please see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report – Settlement of Claims with IDT and Sale of Straight Path IP Group. 
 
FCC advances approval of mobile services in millimeter wave (“mmW”) bands, including adopting the Upper Microwave Flexible Use (“UMFU”) Report and Order
 
We hold a significant number of FCC licenses that permit the use of the spectrum for fixed and mobile wireless services in the United States, providing broad geographic coverage and a large amount of total bandwidth in many areas. These include licenses in the 39 GHz band (38.6 – 40 GHz) and the 28 GHz A1 band (27.5 – 28.35 GHz). We also hold FCC licenses that permit the use of the spectrum for fixed wireless services in other parts of the local multipoint distribution service (“LMDS”) band (29.1 – 29.25 GHz, 31.075 – 31.225 GHz, 31.0 – 31.075 GHz and 31.225 – 31.300 GHz). Our 39 GHz spectrum licenses cover the entire continental U.S. with an average of more than 600 megahertz (“MHz”) of bandwidth in the top 30 U.S. markets (measured by population according to the 2010 U.S. Census), as well as LMDS licenses in many key markets. The FCC initially allocated these frequency bands for fixed and mobile services, but established rules only for fixed services.
 
On July 14, 2016, the FCC adopted the UMFU Report and Order, which opens four millimeter-wave bands for flexible mobile and fixed wireless services. The rules apply to the LMDS A1 and 39 GHz bands, as well as the 37 GHz band and a new unlicensed band at 60 GHz (64.0-71.0 GHz). Among other things, the UMFU Report and Order changed the substantial service deadline for our 735 39 GHz licenses and 15 of our LMDS A1 licenses to June 1, 2024. For a further discussion, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this Annual Report under the heading “FCC License Renewal.”
 
Straight Path is also participating in standard setting, namely through 3GPP, as a contributing member.

Straight Path Ventures
 
Straight Path Ventures is developing next generation wireless technology primarily for 39 GHz at our Gigabit Mobility Lab in Plano, Texas.
 
On August 22, 2016, Straight Path Ventures filed a provisional patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for new beam training technologies in millimeter-wave gigabit broadband systems. On October 12, 2016, Straight Path Ventures filed a patent application with the USPTO for new millimeter-wave transceiver technologies.
 
On August 31, 2017, Straight Path Ventures demonstrated its prototype 39 GHz Gigarray® solutions that achieved 800 megabits per second at a distance of 500 meters. Our Gigabit Mobility Lab continues to refine the Gigarray® for Fixed 5G®. 
 
Straight Path IP Group
 
On April 9, 2017, we and IDT entered into the IDT Term Sheet to settle potential claims related to certain claims under agreements related to the Spin-Off, and the sale of our interest in Straight Path IP Group to IDT. For a further discussion, please see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report – Settlement of Claims with IDT and Sale of Straight Path IP Group.
 
On October 9, 2014, the Patent Trial and Appeals Board of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTAB”) issued an administrative decision stating that claims 1-7 and 32-42 of U.S. Patent No. 6,108,704 (the “‘704 Patent”) are unpatentable. Straight Path IP Group appealed that decision. On November 25, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “CAFC”) reversed the PTAB’s decision and remanded the case back to the PTAB for further proceedings. On May 23, 2016, the PTAB issued a final written decision finding none of the challenged claims unpatentable.
 
Following the favorable CAFC decision, the PTAB denied pending petitions for inter partes review (“IPR”) of the ‘704 Patent and other patents held by Straight Path IP Group. As well, the PTAB found nearly all the claims patentable over the prior art in pending IPRs. The petitioners appealed to the CAFC. On June 23, 2017, the CAFC affirmed the PTAB’s decision. 
 
Following the second affirmance by the CAFC, the stays that had been in place in the civil actions pending in federal district courts for the Eastern District of Virginia and Eastern District of Texas have been lifted. Straight Path IP Group’s suit against several Verizon affiliates in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York is currently stayed until December 8, 2017. Straight Path IP Group has also filed complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Apple, Inc. (“Apple”), Avaya Inc. (“Avaya”), and Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”). Expert discovery is underway in the Apple and Cisco actions. However, Avaya recently filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. On May 2, 2017, Straight Path IP Group filed a proof of claim in the Avaya bankruptcy proceeding. In addition, on September 13, 2017, Apple filed a request in the USPTO for ex parte reexamination of U.S. Patent No. 7,149,208 in the USPTO. 
 
STRAIGHT PATH SPECTRUM 
 
Overview 

We hold a significant number of licenses approved for fixed and mobile wireless spectrum in the United States, providing broad geographic coverage and a large amount of total bandwidth in many areas. These include licenses in the 39 GHz (38.6-40 GHz) band and the 28 GHz (27.5-28.35 GHz) portion of the LMDS band. We also hold licenses for fixed wireless spectrum in other parts of the LMDS band. We have 39 GHz spectrum licenses covering the entire continental U.S. with an average of more than 600 megahertz (“MHz”) of bandwidth in the top 30 U.S. markets (measured by population according to the 2010 U.S. Census), as well as LMDS licenses in many key markets.
 
On July 14, 2016, after a 21-month regulatory process, the FCC voted to adopt the UMFU Report & Order, which opens our spectrum for flexible mobile and fixed wireless services. As the demand for significantly greater capacity within wireless networks has grown rapidly, planning and investment for 5th generation (“5G”) mobile networks has become a major focus of the mobile industry. We believe that our spectrum holdings—which cover the entire continental U.S. and have capacity that is substantially greater than currently used access frequencies—are well-suited for use in 5G networks. While 5G technology is being developed and may be years away from commercialization, the preparatory steps—specifically putting in place a regulatory framework “where these technologies can flourish”—are underway. Straight Path is also participating in standard setting, namely through 3GPP, as a contributing member.
 
Currently, our spectrum is used primarily to provide fixed wireless services for existing Wireless Internet Service Providers (“WISPs”) and Mobile Network Operators (“MNOs”). MNOs have used our spectrum for macro cellular backhaul where fiber backhaul is not available or as a substitute for fiber.

History
 
In December 2001, IDT, through its subsidiary, Winstar Holdings, LLC, acquired certain FCC spectrum licenses and other assets from the bankruptcy estate of Winstar Communications, Inc. IDT acquired certain other FCC spectrum licenses through other unrelated transactions. Certain of those spectrum licenses were transferred to Straight Path Spectrum, Inc. (then known as IDT Spectrum, Inc.). Certain licenses were allowed to lapse upon expiration, and others were extended.
Our Spectrum Holdings
 
We hold a significant number of licenses approved for fixed and mobile wireless spectrum in the U.S., providing broad geographic coverage and a large amount of total bandwidth in many markets. Our 39 GHz licenses comprise our primary spectrum holdings. Currently, the U.S. is divided into 175 licensable Economic Areas (“EAs”) for 39 GHz spectrum. We hold 735 EA licenses in the 39 GHz band that cover all 175 EAs. Based on a comparison of the geographic areas covered by our licenses with the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2010 Census, we cover all of the U.S. population. Our 39 GHz licenses include at least 100 MHz of total bandwidth in every EA in the U.S., and in higher population areas, our 39 GHz licenses cover at least 600 MHz of bandwidth. As a result, we believe that we are well positioned to provide a single source of fixed and mobile wireless spectrum solutions across a variety of geographic areas and bandwidth requirements.
 
We also hold 133 LMDS Basic Trading Area (“BTA”) licenses, including 16 licenses in the 27.5 – 28.35 GHz LMDS A1 band that was included in the UMFU Report and Order adopted by the FCC on July 14, 2016.
 
Our Strategy
 
We have agreed with Verizon, except as provided in the Verizon Merger Agreement, to operate our business in the ordinary course and maintain our business, our licenses and relationships. However, we are restricted from taking certain actions that would be inconsistent with the intent of the Verizon Merger Agreement as more fully described in that agreement. Accordingly, we are currently focused on satisfying the conditions to the completion of the Merger and will not be seeking to expand its leasing or other Spectrum business operations. The Consent Decree with the FCC bars us from entering into any new leases of our spectrum, which limits our ability to increase our leasing revenue in the future. In addition, under the Verizon Merger Agreement, we are restricted from taking certain actions that would be inconsistent with the intent of the Verizon Merger Agreement as more fully described in that agreement. Accordingly, we currently are not seeking to expand our leasing or other spectrum business operations. See the discussion above.
 
Straight Path Spectrum’s assets are complemented by technology being developed by Straight Path Ventures, which opened our Gigabit Mobility Lab in Plano, Texas run by our Chief Technology Officer, Zhouyue (Jerry) Pi (“Jerry Pi”). On August 22, 2016, Straight Path Ventures filed a provisional patent application with the USPTO for new beam training technologies in millimeter-wave gigabit broadband systems. On October 12, 2016, Straight Path Ventures filed a patent application with the USPTO for new millimeter-wave transceiver technologies.

Our Services
 
Spectrum Leasing Services
 
We currently lease spectrum and provide related services for last mile, mid-mile, fixed access, and backhaul applications to internet service and telecommunications providers and other companies that operate fixed wireless networks and have the staff and operational systems to support a network build-out. The Consent Decree with the FCC bars us from entering into any new leases of our spectrum, which limits our ability to increase our leasing revenue in the future. In addition, under the Verizon Merger Agreement, we are restricted from taking certain actions that would be inconsistent with the intent of the Verizon Merger Agreement as more fully described in that agreement. Accordingly, we currently are not seeking to expand our leasing or other spectrum business operations. 
 
See the discussion above.

 
Point-to-Multipoint Installations
 
Fixed wireless operations in our bands can be deployed using PTP or PMP installations.  PTP typically deploys highly directive antennas at each end of the link, which requires dedicated transceiver hardware at each end of the link.  In PMP applications, a transceiver can support multiple connection points thus reducing the expense of additional hardware and the space demands of that equipment.  Our spectrum holdings are expressly authorized for PMP applications by the FCC.  In PMP deployments, a hub with sectored antennas can provide connectivity to a number of terminals anywhere within the hub’s coverage area.  New sites can be added without revisiting the hub site, up to capacity limits that vary based on hardware design, capacity considerations by the operator, or other factors.
 
5G
 
The exponentially increasing demand for mobile broadband, coupled with the shortage of spectrum (below 3 GHz) traditionally used for mobile communication and mobile data transmission has spurred technological advances that can utilize millimeter wave frequencies—such as ours—to “access” mobile devices.

Until 2016, millimeter wave frequencies,1 those bands from 24 GHz and higher, including our 39 GHz and LMDS spectrum, had not been considered for access to mobile devices due to their propagation characteristics. As a result, millimeter wave frequencies have been limited to fixed, line-of-sight applications. Lower frequency access spectrum, on the other hand, can penetrate or bypass interposing objects, such as buildings, and reach to the endpoints, i.e. end-user devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, and other portable devices without line-of-sight (non line-of-sight). Over the past several years, as data consumption has increased exponentially and concern has risen regarding the adequacy of the current supply of access spectrum (often referred to as the “spectrum crunch”), technologists have developed innovative base station devices with far greater number of antenna components (i.e. phased array) that can overcome the current propagation limitations for short, yet substantial distances, far shorter than fixed line-of-sight links, yet far greater distances and capacity than current Wi-Fi implementations.
 
Straight Path Spectrum joined NYU WIRELESS as an Industrial Affiliate to support and encourage the advances and commercialization of 5G millimeter wave technology. Of note, many leading technology companies—Samsung, Intel, Ericsson, NSN, and others—are also Industrial Affiliates at NYU WIRELESS. Straight Path also hired Jerry Pi as our Chief Technology Officer in September 2014. Mr. Pi is a pioneer in 5G technology, having led the group at Samsung that developed a working prototype for mobile transmission at 28 GHz. Mr. Pi is a leader in millimeter wave mobility technology. He has co-authored more than 30 technical journals and conference papers and is a co-inventor of more than 150 patents and applications.
 
The recognition of millimeter wave mobility as a necessary solution for the data demand and spectrum crunch has reached the highest levels. The FCC adopted rules on July 14, 2016 to allow mobile services in a number of millimeter wave bands, as addressed above.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
The Consent Decree with the FCC bars us from entering into any new leases of our spectrum, which limits our ability to increase our leasing revenue in the future. In addition, under the Verizon Merger Agreement, we are restricted from taking certain actions that would be inconsistent with the intent of the Verizon Merger Agreement as more fully described in that agreement. Accordingly, we currently are not seeking to expand our leasing or other spectrum business operations. 
Competition
 
We operate in the highly competitive telecommunications market. We compete primarily on the basis of our fixed wireless spectrum portfolio, experience and technical skills, competitive pricing model, service quality, reliability, and deployment speed.
 
We face significant competition from entities that deliver voice and data transmission service and capacity through a variety of methods, including copper, fiber, coaxial cable, and other wireless communications solutions.
 
Our principal competitors to our current spectrum leasing services are fiber providers such as Level 3 Communications, Inc., NEON and Verizon, cable companies such as Comcast and Time Warner, other spectrum license holders such as Nextlink Wireless, LLC, long-distance interexchange carriers such as AT&T and Verizon, and the wireless operators that lease Common Carrier fixed microwave service from the FCC. Each competitive network option may offer advantages based on the wireless operators’ particular application, such as capacity or distance requirements, deployment time, or many other factors. 
 
Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, long-standing relationships with customers and suppliers, greater name recognition, and greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do and, as a result, may have substantial competitive advantages over us. Additionally, market perceptions as to reliability and security for fixed wireless solutions as compared to copper or fiber networks provide us with additional marketing challenges. We may not be able to exploit new or emerging technologies or adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly than these competitors, or devote the necessary resources to the marketing and sale of our services.
 


1 While millimeter wave traditionally refers to frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz, we use the term to refer to 24 GHz and above, as that is the range that the FCC has indicated an interest in developing to allow mobile usage therein.
 
The FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how wireless spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands.  The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to our spectrum licenses and operations could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business and compete with other fixed wireless service providers.

With regards to the possibility of our spectrum being utilized in 5G networks, the UMFU Report and Order adopted by the FCC on July 14, 2016 allowed for mobile usage in four bands, including our 39 GHz and 28 GHz LMDS A1 spectrum. While we believe 39 GHz is the best path forward, we recognize that competing interests abound. Other license holders in other bands will certainly attempt to raise the profile of their assets as ideal for mobile services, while others will raise the profile of bands yet to be licensed. In addition, on July 14, 2016, the FCC issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that, among other things, proposed to adopt flexible fixed and mobile use in bands that could make up to 17.7 GHz of additional spectrum available, and ultimately holders of licenses in these bands may compete with Straight Path.
 
Unlicensed spectrum—in millimeter waves and below—can also be a source of competition.  As well, MNOs are incentivized to maximize efficiencies in the spectrum they’ve already acquired. Equipment manufacturers may search for solutions that will optimize the status quo, and delay the move to millimeter wave mobility. 
 
Regulatory Framework
 
Significant statements concerning the regulatory environment are set forth in Item 1A to Part I “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report, and we strongly recommend reviewing that section in conjunction with this section.
 
Our wireless operations and wireless licenses in the 39 GHz and LMDS bands are subject to significant regulation and oversight, primarily by the FCC and, to a certain extent, by Congress, other federal agencies, and state and local authorities. At the federal level, the FCC has jurisdiction over the use of the electromagnetic spectrum, including exclusive jurisdiction over licensing and technical rules for operations of mobile wireless carriers, certain site acquisition matters, and all interstate telecommunications services. State regulatory commissions have jurisdiction over intrastate common carrier and certain other communications providers, unless preempted by the FCC. Municipalities may regulate limited aspects of our business by, for example, imposing zoning requirements, requiring installation permits, and controlling access to public rights-of-way. The regulations of these agencies are continually evolving through rulemakings, adjudications, and other administrative and judicial proceedings, and future regulatory changes or interpretation of existing regulations could have an adverse effect on our business.
 
FCC Licensing and Regulation
 
In general, the FCC’s regulations impose potential limits on, among other things, the amount of foreign investment that may be made in some types of FCC licenses, on the transfer or sale of rights in licenses, on the construction and technical aspects of the operation of wireless communication systems, and on the nature of the services that can be provided within a particular frequency band.  The FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands.  In addition, we are subject to certain regulatory and other fees levied by the FCC for certain classes of licenses and services.  The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to our wireless licenses and operations could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business.  Under some circumstances, our licenses may be canceled or conditioned.  We also may be fined for any violation of the FCC’s rules, and in extreme cases, our licenses may be revoked.
 
The FCC determines the use of specific frequency bands by particular services.  If the FCC decides in the future to allocate additional spectrum in the high frequency bands to competing services, the successful auction of that spectrum could increase the number of entities that hold this spectrum, and its general availability could have a material adverse effect on the value of our spectrum.   In addition, on July 14, 2016, the FCC issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that, among other things, proposed to adopt flexible fixed and mobile use in bands that could make up to 17.7 GHz of additional spectrum available. This may increase potential competition with our wireless licenses and have an adverse effect on our business.
 
Our spectrum licenses in the LMDS and 39 GHz bands have historically been granted for ten-year terms. On April 20, 2016, the FCC granted our application to renew our LMDS BTA license for the LMDS A1 band (27.5 – 28.35 GHz) that covers parts of the New York City BTA for a ten-year period, until February 1, 2026. We have 15 other LMDS A1 licenses; nine of these licenses currently have a renewal date of August 10, 2018, and six of these licenses have a renewal date of September 21, 2018. However, following the adoption of the UMFU Report and Order, the next substantial service demonstration date for these 16 LMDS A1 licenses is June 1, 2024, not at the renewal deadline.
 
It is likely that the FCC will issue new licenses for the LMDS A1 spectrum on the one hand and the A2 and A3 licenses on the other, with separate renewal and substantial service deadlines for each (as noted above, the substantial service demonstration dates for the A1 licenses will be June 1, 2024). Of the 15 BTAs in which we hold LMDS A2 band (29.1 – 29.25 GHz) and A3 band (31.075 – 31.225 GHz) spectrum, nine licenses currently have a renewal and likely substantial service deadline of August 10, 2018 and six of these licenses currently have a renewal and likely substantial service deadline of September 21, 2018. The UMFU Report and Order does not affect the LMDS B band spectrum. Of our 117 LMDS B band (31.0 – 31.075 GHz and 31.225 – 31.300 GHz) spectrum, five licenses currently have a renewal and substantial service deadline of August 10, 2018 and 112 licenses currently have a renewal and substantial service deadline of September 21, 2018. On August 3, 2017, the FCC adopted new rules governing the process by which licensees may seek renewal of their authorizations. However, for the licenses we hold, those rules do not go into effect until January 1, 2023, after all of licenses will be renewed.
 
The UMFU Report and Order build-out date of June 1, 2024 also applies to our 735 39 GHz licenses, which currently have a renewal date of October 18, 2020.

The “substantial service” requirement referenced above applies to each of these LMDS and 39 GHz licenses.   Substantial service showings for each of our licenses were filed on or before the final construction deadline.  The substantial service requirement is intended to provide licensees with flexibility in constructing their licenses.  The FCC has established “safe harbor” guidelines that provide licensees with a degree of certainty as to how to comply with the requirement, and those guidelines were made more stringent in the UMFU Report and Order. In addition, the UMFU Report and Order provides that current licensees in the 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands who, under the current rules, face a deadline for demonstrating substantial service after the adoption date of the UMFU Report and Order will not be required to demonstrate substantial service at renewal. Rather, those licensees will be required to fulfill the performance requirements for their respective licenses by June 1, 2024. If the FCC finds that a licensee has failed to meet the substantial service requirement for any license, however, that authorization is subject to termination.
 
The FCC rules require that certain providers of telecommunications file reports with, and make contributions to, the Universal Service Fund (“USF”).  In general, while reports may have to be filed, contributions to the USF generally need not be made with respect to revenues received for “resale-type” or “leased” services — telecommunications capacity sold or leased in bulk to a carrier who then uses that capacity to provide services to end-users.  Conversely, revenues received with respect to “retail-type” services generally are subject to a USF contribution requirement. Historically, we have not been subject to a USF contribution requirement.  Our future operations may require us to make USF reports and/or contributions, depending on the nature of the services we offer and the type of customers we serve.  USF contributions, which are typically passed to the customer, may make our services more expensive.
 
Additionally, the FCC requires the payment of annual and other fees in certain circumstances, including but not limited to regulatory fees, application processing fees, and contributions to other funds.  If any of these requirements change, it may make our services more expensive.
 
On January 11, 2017, we entered into the Consent Decree with the FCC settling the FCC’s investigation regarding Straight Path Spectrum’s spectrum licenses. See the discussion above. 
 
On June 1, 2017, we and Verizon submitted applications to the FCC seeking consent to transfer control of our spectrum licenses to Verizon. The transfer of control applications was referenced in an FCC Public Notice on July 21, 2017, and the FCC established a pleading cycle, allowing interested parties to comment on why the transaction should be approved or denied. Petitions to deny the application were due on August 11, 2017, oppositions to those petitions due on August 18, 2017 and replies to those oppositions were due on August 25, 2017.
 
Three parties – the Competitive Carriers Association, Public Knowledge and New America’s Open Technology Institute, and U.S. Telepacific – filed petitions to deny the transaction. INCOMPAS filed comments asking that the FCC closely examine the transaction. The petitioning parties argued that approval of the transaction would result in excessive spectrum aggregation in local markets, undermine competition in 5G mobile broadband by precluding others from acquiring 5G spectrum, improperly benefit Straight Path in violation of the FCC Consent Decree, and terminate existing spectrum leases. In response, we and Verizon argued that approval of this transaction will advance 5G leadership. We and Verizon explained that the transaction will not create any competitive issues, and, once Verizon acquires the spectrum, it will remain below the FCC’s spectrum threshold for competitive review across the vast majority of markets. We and Verizon argued that opponents of the transaction cannot use the transaction to challenge the Consent Decree, review of this transaction must be limited to the transaction, and that the terms of the Consent Decree are final and are the result of the FCC’s deliberate and sound policy choices. We and Verizon clarified that Verizon will honor our contractual obligations under existing spectrum leases with third parties. In their replies, the parties opposing the transaction maintained their prior arguments, and also argued that the FCC should auction our spectrum licenses instead of approving the transaction and that the transaction is not in the public interest. 
 
On September 7, 2017 and September 21, 2017, Hammer Fiber Optics filed ex parte letters noting a number of meetings with staff from the FCC’s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (“WTB”) and Office of Engineering and Technology (“OET”), and meetings with Chairman Ajit Pai’s, Commissioner Mignon Clyburn’s, and Commissioner Brendan Carr’s legal advisors. In the letters, Hammer discussed the relevance of the transaction with respect to the service it is providing, and also stated that it did not object to Verizon’s acquisition of our LMDS spectrum. 
 
State Regulation
 
We believe that the fixed wireless communications that we are providing are not subject to state public utility regulation.  Nonetheless, it is possible that one or more state regulators will seek to assert jurisdiction over us, and therefore, impose additional regulatory burdens on, us and our services.  If one or more state regulatory commissions were to impose regulations on our services, our compliance could materially increase our costs of providing services and therefore have an adverse impact on our business operations and profitability.
 
Significant statements concerning the regulatory environment are set forth in Item 1A to Part I “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report, and we strongly recommend reviewing that section in conjunction with this section.

These patents had finite lives. The claims of U.S. Patent No. 6,108,704 and its continuations, continuations-in-part, and divisionals expired on September 25, 2015. One patent in the NetSpeak portfolio, U.S. Patent No. 6,178,453, expired on April 4, 2017. Straight Path IP Group may continue to enforce the patents for patent infringement that occurred before expiration, although we do not anticipate filing additional actions. The complexity of patent and common law, combined with our limited resources, create risk that our efforts to protect our patents may not be successful.  We cannot be assured that our patents will be upheld, or that third parties will not invalidate our patents.
 
Straight Path IP Group also owns the Droplet portfolio. The Droplet patent portfolio includes United States Patents Nos. 6,847,317; 7,844,122; 7,525,463; 8,279,098; 7,436,329; 7,679,649, 8,947,271, 8,896,717, 8,849,964, 8,896,652 and a number of U.S. and foreign patent applications.

On October 9, 2014, the PTAB held the claims at issue in the ‘704 Patent were unpatentable, and Straight Path IP Group appealed the decision to the CAFC. On November 25, 2015, the CAFC reversed the PTAB’s cancellation of all challenged claims, and remanded back to the PTAB for proceedings consistent with the opinion. On May 23, 2016, the PTAB issued a final written decision finding none of the challenged claims were unpatentable. Subsequently, the PTAB issued a final written decision finding none of the challenged claims unpatentable. Following the favorable CAFC decision, the PTAB denied pending petitions for IPR of the ‘704 Patent and other patents held by Straight Path IP Group. As well, the PTAB found nearly all the claims patentable over the prior art in pending IPRs. The petitioners appealed to the CAFC. On June 23, 2017, the CAFC issued its decision affirming the PTAB’s final written decision. That decision became final on July 31, 2017 when the CAFC issued its mandate.
 
Straight Path IP Group has six pending actions in federal district court, against Apple, Avaya, Cisco, Verizon, LG Electronics Inc. et al. (“LG”) and other defendants (including Amazon.com, Inc.
