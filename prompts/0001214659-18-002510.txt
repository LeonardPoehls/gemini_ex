Company Overview; Recent Developments
 
El Capitan Precious Metals, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is based in Prescott, Arizona. Together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Company,” “our” or “we”), the Company is an exploration stage company as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) Industry Guide 7, as the Company has no established reserves as required under the Industry Guide 7. We are principally engaged in the exploration of precious metals and other minerals. Our primary asset is a 100% equity ownership interest in El Capitan, Ltd., an Arizona corporation (“ECL”), which holds an interest in the El Capitan property located near Capitan, New Mexico (the “El Capitan Property”) . Our ultimate objective is to market and sell the El Capitan Property to a major mining company or enter into a joint venture arrangement with a major mining company to conduct mining operations. There is no assurance that commercially viable mineral reserves exist at the El Capitan Property. To date, we have not had any material revenue producing operations. We have completed research and confirmation procedures on the recovery process for the El Capitan Property mineralized material and our evaluation as to the economic and legal feasibility of the property, but we have not yet demonstrated the existence of proven or probable deposits on our property. 
 
We commenced planned mineral exploration activity in the quarter ended December 2015 under our modified mining permit. However, we have not yet demonstrated the existence of proven or probable reserves at the El Capitan Property.  As a result, and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for exploration stage companies, all expenditures for exploration and evaluation of our property are expensed as incurred. 
 
“Mineralized material” as used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, although permissible under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC’s”) Industry Guide 7, does not indicate “reserves” by SEC standards. We cannot be certain that any part of the El Capitan Property will ever be confirmed or converted into SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant “reserves.” Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineralized material will ever be confirmed or converted into reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted.
 
Business Operations
 
The Company is an exploration stage company as defined by the SEC’s Industry Guide 7 as the Company has no established reserves as required under Industry Guide 7. We are principally engaged in the exploration of precious metals and other minerals on the El Capitan Property. We recorded nominal miscellaneous income in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2017, resulting from the sale of test loads of iron ore to a construction contractor in fiscal 2016 and the sale of two test smelts on concentrates processed at our pilot plant located in Phoenix, Arizona in fiscal 2017.
 
In late April 2014, we announced the purchase of a heavy metals separation system from AuraSource, Inc (OTCBB and OCTGB: ARAO). This system will separate hematite and magnetite from other mineral elements in the El Capitan mineral deposits. The AuraSource process leaves a concentrate for additional processing that is used by the Company to extract precious metals.
 
The Company has methods for both the separation of the iron and the separation and recovery of the precious metals that have yielded consistent results. Another significant aspect of these technologies for separation and recovery is that they are environmentally friendly and do not rely on the use of caustic chemicals.
 
On August 4, 2015, we signed a contract with an independent subcontract miner to mine, process and concentrate the ore at the El Capitan site. The clearing of the overburden at the site commenced in late August 2015.
 
We commenced mineral exploration activity in the quarter ended December 2015 under our modified mining permit. However, we have not yet demonstrated the existence of proven or probable reserves at the El Capitan Property.  
 
In February 2017, with the assistance of our Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) consultant and legal consultants, we signed an agreement with the United States Forest Service that governs the terms and conditions for the use of the road to our mine site. A copy of the agreement is posted on the Company web site.

The quarter ended March 31, 2017 marked the beginning of operations at a “pilot plant” established in Phoenix, Arizona by a Company vendor to house equipment obtained from China that processes concentrates recovered at the El Capitan Property. Although the pilot plant, including the equipment, are owned by its operator and not by the Company, its establishment brought the Company a significant step closer to recognizing revenue from the sale of concentrates. Significant effort was exerted during this quarter by our contract miner and his team in preparing the pilot plant site for the arrival of the approximately 20 ton machine from China. Upon its arrival, the machine was setup and on site enhancements were made to meet US safety standards and operational proficiencies for maximum through put and operational product results. Initially the pilot plant started producing test samples for shipments to various refiners. As modifications were required by a refiner, adjustments were made and new processed samples were shipped to the refiner. The process was time consuming in that once a refiner receives the sample, it is put into their system for processing and we have no control over the timeline and when we may get the results and comments back on the sample.
 
Continuing through the quarter ended June 30, 2017, sample product was shipped to various refiners for processing and precious metal extraction. During the quarter ending September 30, 2017, the Company signed a one year contract with a refiner for the extraction of precious metals from the Company’s concentrates and signed an agreement with PF Bullion for the purchase of the precious metals. Currently our contract miner is melting the concentrate ore into metal bars for delivery to the refiner.  The refiner is then extracting the precious metals from the metal bars.
 
In the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company recognized its first precious metals sale revenue from the sale of a small sample test bar processed by the refiner. Although nominal, it represented the first sale of precious metals extracted from mineralized material recovered at the El Capitan Property.  The sale, before cost deductions, was $3,637 and initial setup and processing charges amounted to $1,557.  Precious metals recovered from the 4.2 lb bar were as follows:
 

Gold | 2.53 oz.
---------+---------
Silver | 0.54 oz.
Platinum | 0.88 oz.

 
In the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the Company recognized miscellaneous income from a second precious metals sale of a small sample test bar processed by the refiner. Although nominal, this represented the second sale of precious metals extracted from mineralized ore recovered at the El Capitan property and concentrated at the pilot plant.  The sale, after cost deductions, was $10,665.
 
Also during this quarter, the Company's concentrates that were being stored in a bonded warehouse were brought to the pilot plant and concentrated further into less mineralized material to reduce the cost of freight on the concentrates for their sale.
 
Arrangements with Glencore AG and Logistica
 
On March 10, 2014, the Company entered into a life-of-mine off take agreement with Glencore AG (“Glencore”) for the sale of iron extracted from mineralized material at the El Capitan Property (such agreement is referred to herein as the “Glencore Purchase Contract”). Under the terms of the Glencore Purchase Contract, the Company agreed to sell to Glencore, and Glencore agreed to purchase from the Company, iron that meets the applicable specifications from the El Capitan Property mine. Payment for the iron is to be made pursuant an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the Company. The purchase price is based on an index price less an applicable discount. Either party may terminate the Glencore Purchase Contract following a breach by the other party that remains uncured for a specified period after receipt of written notice. Because of current market iron ore prices, the contract has not been implemented or terminated.
 
In anticipation of, and in conjunction with, the Glencore Purchase Contract, the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement (the “Master Agreement”) and corresponding Iron Ore Processing Agreement (the “Processing Agreement”) with Logistica U.S. Terminals, LLC (“Logistica”), each effective as of February 28, 2014. Pursuant to these agreements, Logistica agreed to, among other things, provide the logistics required for the Company to fulfill its obligations under the Glencore Purchase Contract, to assist the Company in financing the costs of processing and delivering iron under the Glencore Purchase Contract, and to provide and/or manage the processing of the iron ore. Because of current market iron ore prices, the contract has not implemented.
 
The contracts with Logistica were superseded by a new agreement entered into on January 5, 2016. Under the new agreement, we will provide to Logistica concentrated ore to their specifications at the mine site, and Logistica will transport, process, and refine the precious metals concentrates to sell to precious metals buyers. When certain terms and conditions are met, the new agreement calls for Logistica to arrange for a letter of credit for working capital for the mining, processing and sale activities. To date, no letter of credit has been arranged. For additional information regarding the Glencore Purchase Contract and our agreements with Logistica, see Note 8 – Commitments and Contingencies to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Price of Precious Metals
 
Gold and silver are each traded as investments on various world markets, including London, New York, Zurich and Tokyo, and are fixed twice daily in London. The “fix” is the reference price on which a large number of precious metal transactions around the world are based. The price is set by a number of market members matching buy and sell orders from all over the world.
 
High, low and average London afternoon fix prices for gold and silver for the period from January 1, 2017 to September 30, 2017 and for the last five calendar years are as follows:

Our ability to sell the El Capitan Property will be highly dependent upon the price of these precious metals, the market for which can be highly volatile. There is no assurance that we will be able to recover precious metals from the El Capitan Property or that we will generate significant revenue from the sale of the El Capitan Property.
 
Competition
 
The mining industry has historically been highly competitive. It is dominated by multi-billion dollar, multi-national companies that possess resources significantly greater than ours. Additionally, due to our limited resources, we do not intend to develop any of our properties on our own, but rather to only perform exploration on our properties with the anticipation of selling or developing through a joint venture any properties in which our exploration proves successful. Given our size and financial condition, there is no assurance we can compete with any larger companies for the acquisition of additional potential mineral properties, and we have no current plans to do so.
Government Regulation
 
Mining and exploration is highly regulated and subject to various constantly changing federal and state laws and regulations. These laws are becoming more and more restrictive, and include without limitation: the Clean Water Act; the Clean Air Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Federal Land Policy and Management Act; the National Environmental Policy Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and related state laws. The environmental protection laws dramatically impact the mining and mineral extraction industries as it pertains to both the use of hazardous materials in the mining and extraction process and from the standpoint of returning the land to a natural look once the mining process is completed. Compliance with federal and state environmental regulations can be expensive and time-consuming, and given our limited resources, such regulations may have a material effect on the success of our operations.

Compliance with the various federal and state governmental regulations requires us to obtain multiple permits for each mining property. Although the requirements may differ slightly in each of the respective states in which we may hold claims or may hold claims in the future, the process of securing such permits generally require the filing of a “Notice of Intent to Locate Mining Claims” and the payment of a fee of $20 to the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) office in the state in which the claim is located. Subsequently, we are required to file and record a New Location Notice for each such claim within 90 days of locating the claim, the fee for which is approximately $192. On an annual basis, we are required to pay a maintenance fee of $155 per claim which is due September 1 of each year.
 
To the extent we intend to take action on a property that is more than “casual use,” which generally includes activities that cause only negligible disturbance to the land (this would not generally include drilling or operating earthmoving equipment on the property), we are required to prepare and file with the BLM either a notice of operation or plan of operation identifying the activity we intend to take on the property, including a plan of reclamation indicating how we intend to return the land to its prior state upon completion of our activities. For each claim that we file a notice or plan of operations, we are required to pay a one-time reclamation bond to the BLM to be used toward restoration of the property upon completion of our activities. The amount of the reclamation bond is determined by the BLM based upon the scope of the activity described in the notice or plan of operation, and will thus vary with each property.
 
In connection with the original plan of operation on the El Capitan Property that we filed with the BLM, we were required to pay a reclamation bond of $15,000. Upon payment we were issued a notice to proceed from the BLM. This allowed us to proceed with our original plan of operation on up to five (5) acres.  The permit was received by the Company from the previous owners of the El Capitan Property under a grandfather clause and allows operations on five (5) acres of the property at a time. In 2015, we amended the permit to allow operations on forty acres (40) of property at a time. The amended permit was issued in March 25, 2015, and we were required to increase our reclamation bond to $74,495 and in February 2017 the U.S. Forest Service required an additional bond of $5,350 for road remediation. The balance of restricted cash for these bonds including interest is $79,861 at September 30, 2017.
 
In July 2007, we submitted a Plan of Operation for continued exploration on a 2,000 acre parcel within our more than 7,000 acres, at that time, Company claim block near Capitan, New Mexico with the U.S. Forest Service (“USFS”). We hired an experienced environmental services firm to manage this effort. Having this permit in place would provide the opportunity for a professional and methodical investigation into the additional geologic potential of this portion of our holdings, without requiring further time-consuming permitting efforts. The area being permitted will allow access to a number of high-potential targets identified through previous surface sampling and remote sensing efforts, as well as to the prospective area to the west of the existing deposit, which remains open to geologic resource extension. The USFS permitting effort is governed by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 (“NEPA”) and under the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended. In conjunction with the USFS filing, the Company submitted an Exploration Permit with the New Mexico Mining and Minerals Division (“MMD”). The permitting process is a robust process that can take a significant amount of time to complete. The typical process generally takes longer than the prescribed regulatory time frame, and is dependent upon a number of factors outside of our control, including, without limitation, governmental approvals, licensing and permitting, as well as potential opposition by third parties. Both permits must be approved prior to the commencement of drilling activity. 
 
In July 2008, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the USFS related to the permitting of 112 exploration drill holes planned on 2,000 acres of Company claims in Lincoln County, New Mexico. The action signaled the initiation of the Federal Environmental Assessment (“EA”) permitting process. It was originally anticipated that the receipt of these two permits would occur in the second or third quarter of 2009. Subsequently in late 2008, this process was put on hold due to a lack of working capital and a potential conflict of interest with the USFS by the environmental services firm we were utilizing for the permitting process.
 
In December 2009, we hired a new experienced environmental services firm, AMEC Environment & Infrastructure, Inc. (“AMEC”), to manage and oversee our continued permitting process. AMEC has drafted a replacement Plan of Operations (“PoO”) and submitted it to the USFS. The USFS has provided technical comments on the PoO and AMEC has responded to their comments and submitted a revised PoO for approval. AMEC has met with representatives of the USFS at the project site to review the proposed exploration locations and general discussion of the project. Subsequent to the meeting, the USFS agreed to work with AMEC to develop the third part of the NEPA scope of work. The USFS provided a draft NEPA scope of work template to AMEC in electronic format. AMEC revised the draft template and submitted it to the USFS for review and approval.

AMEC has also prepared the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (“SWPPP”) that will be sent to the agencies upon permit approval. Informational copies of the SWPPP will be provided to the MMD and the USFS.  The SWPPP is an EPA required document for construction projects that disturb more than one (1) acre of land.  Prior to field activities, coverage under the New Mexico Construction General Permit (“CGP”) will be obtained by filing a Notice of Intent (“NOI”) with EPA Region 6. Coverage under the CGP is required prior to field work.  A copy of the SWPPP must be maintained at the project site during all construction activities.  New Mexico does not have primacy over the SWPPP requirements.  EPA Region 6 is the primary agency. 
 
AMEC prepared and submitted a revised New Mexico Mining and Minerals Subpart 4 Exploration permit application. The revised application was submitted on September 16, 2011 and MMD issued administrative completeness determination on October 4, 2012.  The Agency comment period closed on December 31, 2012.  MMD requested a site visit as part of the Agency review process, and the site visit was conducted on December 5, 2012. A second site visit was requested by MMD to view locations that were not accessible. Revisions to the boring locations were made, based on the field visit, and revised boring location figures were submitted to the MMD on April 26, 2013. To date a second site visit has not been conducted related to the drill hole sites. 
 
A PoO was submitted to the USFS in 2011.  Comments were received from the USFS and incorporated into a revised document which was resubmitted to the USFS.  In addition, at the request of the USFS, a NEPA scope of work (“SOW”) was prepared and submitted to the USFS in 2012.  Comments were received from the USFS and incorporated into a revised NEPA SOW.  This activity has been on hold since April 2013.  In February through April 2013, the existing mine permit (L1005 ME) for the El Capitan Property mine site and a cursory review of water rights issues were evaluated. 
 
In May 2014, and in conjunction with requesting modifications to our mining permit, we submitted a revised PoO, as well as the required reclamation plan for the site. The modified permit approval process required we increase the amount of our reclamation bond to $74,495. We posted the increased bond in January 2015 and received the modified mining permit on March 25, 2015.
 
In June 2014 we applied for an Air Quality Permit for our operation, which is tied to the generation of dust from the mining and crushing process. This permit was issued by the New Mexico Environment Department Air Quality Bureau in November 2014.
 
During our fiscal operating year ending September 30, 2016, the Company received various minor violations from MSHA. The proposed assessments were contested by the Company. The proposed assessments aggregated $1,864.  On July 3, 2017, we received a letter from the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission that the citations were vacated and dismissed.
Employees
 
We currently have informal arrangements with two individuals, one of whom is an officer and director of the Company and one is an officer of the Company, who serve as support staff for the functioning of all the corporate activities. There are no written agreements with these individuals. Additionally, we use consultants for the testing and exploration of property claims. If administrative requirements expand, we anticipate that we may hire additional employees, and utilize a combination of employees and consultants as necessary to conduct these activities.
