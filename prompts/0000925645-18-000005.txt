ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Central European Media Enterprises Ltd., a Bermuda company limited by shares, is a media and entertainment company operating in Central and Eastern Europe. Our assets are held through a series of Dutch and Curaçao holding companies. We manage our business on a geographical basis, with four operating segments, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Romania and the Slovak Republic, which are also our reportable segments and our main operating countries. We own 94% of our Bulgaria operations and 100% of our companies in our remaining countries.
On July 9, 2017, we entered into a framework agreement with Slovenia Broadband S.à r.l., a wholly owned subsidiary of United Group B.V., relating to the sale of our Croatia and Slovenia operations. Accordingly, these operations are classified as held for sale and they are presented as discontinued operations for all periods in this report; and the discussion below relates to our continuing operations in the four remaining operating segments. See Part II, Item 8, Note 3, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale" for further information.
Our main operating countries are members of the European Union (the “EU”). However, as emerging economies, they have adopted Western-style democratic forms of government and have economic structures, political and legal systems, systems of corporate governance and business practices that continue to evolve. As the economies of our operating countries converge with more developed nations and their economic and commercial infrastructures continue to develop, we believe the business risks of operating in these countries will continue to decline.
We operate market leading television networks in each of these four countries, broadcasting a total of 26 television channels to more than 40 million people living in the region. Each segment also develops and produces content for their television channels. We generate advertising revenues in our country operations primarily through entering into agreements with advertisers, advertising agencies and sponsors to place advertising on the television channels that we operate. We generate additional revenues by collecting fees from cable, direct-to-home (“DTH”) and internet protocol television ("IPTV") operators for carriage of our channels.
Our strategy is to maintain or increase our audience leadership in each of our countries and to pursue sales strategies designed to maximize our revenues in order to provide additional financial resources to invest in local content. We have built our audience leadership in each of our markets by operating a multi-channel business model with a diversified portfolio of television channels which appeal to a broad audience.

Content that consistently generates high audience shares is crucial to maintaining the success of each of our country operations. While content acquired from the Hollywood studios remains popular, our audiences increasingly demand content that is produced in their local language and reflects their society, attitudes and culture. We believe developing and producing local content is key to being successful in prime time and supporting market-leading channels and that maintaining a regular stream of popular local content at the lowest possible cost is operationally important over the long term.
As the distribution platforms in our region develop and become more diversified, our television channels and content will increasingly reach viewers through new distribution offerings, such as internet TV and smart devices. We offer viewers the choice of watching premium television content through a series of portals, including through Voyo, our subscription video-on-demand service, and advertising supported catch-up services on our websites.
Sales
We generate advertising revenues primarily through entering into agreements with advertisers, advertising agencies and sponsors to place advertising on our television channels.
Our main unit of inventory is the commercial gross rating point (“GRP”), a measure of the number of people watching television when an advertisement is aired. We generally contract with a client to provide an agreed number of GRPs for an agreed price (“cost per point” or “CPP”). Much less frequently, and usually only for small niche channels, we may sell on a fixed spot basis where an advertisement is placed at an agreed time for a negotiated price that is independent of the number of viewers. The CPP varies depending on the season and time of day the advertisement is aired, the volume of GRPs purchased, requests for special positioning of the advertisement, the demographic group that the advertisement is targeting and other factors. Our larger advertising customers generally commit to specified amounts of advertising on an annual basis, which sets the pricing for a minimum volume of GRPs.
We operate our television networks based on a business model of audience leadership, brand strength and popular local content. Our sales strategy is to maximize the monetization of our advertising time by leveraging our high brand power and applying an optimal mix of pricing and sell-out rate. The effectiveness of our sales strategy is measured by our share of the television advertising market, which represents the proportion of our television advertising revenues compared to the total television advertising market. We also generate additional revenues by collecting carriage fees from cable, satellite and IPTV operators for broadcasting our channels.
Programming
Our programming strategy in each country is tailored to match the expectations of key audience demographics by scheduling and marketing an optimal mix of programs in a cost effective manner. The programming that we provide drives our audience shares and ratings (see "Audience Share and Ratings" below) and consists of locally-produced news, current affairs, fiction, and reality and entertainment shows as well as acquired foreign movies, series and sports programming. 
We focus our programming investments on securing leading audience share positions during prime time, where the majority of advertising revenues are delivered, and improving our cost efficiency through optimizing the programming mix and limiting the cost of programming scheduled off-prime time while maintaining all day audience shares.
Audience Share and Ratings
Audience share represents the viewers watching a channel in proportion to the total audience watching television at the time. Ratings represent the number of people watching a channel in proportion to the total population. Audience share and ratings information are measured in each market by independent agencies using peoplemeters, which measure audiences for different demographics and subgeographies of the population throughout the day. Our channels schedule programming intended to attract audiences within specific target demographics that we believe will be attractive to advertisers. The tables below provide a comparison of all day and prime time audience shares for 2017 in the target demographic of each of our leading channels to the primary channels of our main competitors.

Regulation of Television Broadcasting
Television broadcasting in each of the countries in which we operate is regulated by a governmental authority or agency. In this report, we refer to such agencies individually as a “Media Council” and collectively as “Media Councils”. Media Councils generally supervise broadcasters and their compliance with national broadcasting legislation, as well as control access to the available frequencies through licensing regimes.
Programming and Advertising Regulation
Our main operating countries are member states of the EU, and as such, our broadcast operations in such countries are subject to relevant EU legislation relating to media. 
The EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive (the “AVMS Directive”) came into force in March 2010 and provides the legal framework for audiovisual media services generally in the EU. The AVMS Directive covers both linear (i.e., broadcasting) and non-linear (e.g., video-on-demand and catch-up) transmissions of audiovisual media services, with the latter subject to significantly less stringent regulation. Among other things, the AVMS Directive requires broadcasters to comply with rules related to, but not limited to, program content, advertising content and quotas, product placement, sponsorship, teleshopping, accessibility by persons with a visual or hearing disability, and minimum quotas with respect to “European works” (defined as originating from an EU member state or a signatory to the Council of Europe's Convention on Transfrontier Television as well as being written and produced mainly by residents of the EU or Council of Europe member states or pursuant to co-production agreements between such states and other countries). In addition, the AVMS Directive requires that at least 10% of either broadcast time or programming budget is dedicated to programs made by European producers who are independent of broadcasters. News, sports, games, advertising, teletext services and teleshopping are excluded from the calculation of these quotas. In respect of advertising, the AVMS Directive provides that the proportion of television advertising spots and teleshopping spots within a given hour shall not exceed 20% (what is commonly referred to as the ‘12 minute per hour rule’). The AVMS Directive does not otherwise restrict when programming may be interrupted by advertising in linear broadcasting, except in the case of films and news programming (where programming may be interrupted once every thirty minutes or more) and children’s programming (where the same restriction applies providing that the program is greater than thirty minutes) and religious programming (where no advertising or teleshopping shall be inserted). Under the AVMS Directive, product placement is prohibited subject to certain exceptions (for example it is permitted in films and series, sports programs and light entertainment programs) and providing that the use of product placement is not ‘unduly’ prominent, is not promotional and is appropriately identified to viewers. Legislation implementing the AVMS Directive has been adopted across our operating countries.
On May 25, 2016, the European Commission adopted a proposal to amend the AVMS Directive. As proposed, the legislation liberalizes many of the AVMS Directive requirements, including, for example, in respect of hourly advertising limits, product placement, teleshopping and sponsorship. The proposal is subject to consultation, review by the European Commission committees and a vote by the European Parliament in order to be adopted. Following adoption, any amendments to the AVMS Directive would then need to be implemented by our operating countries. 
Please see below for more detailed information on programming and advertising regulations that impact our channels.
Bulgaria: In Bulgaria, privately owned broadcasters are permitted to broadcast advertising for up to 12 minutes per hour. The public broadcaster, BNT, which is financed through a compulsory television license fee and by the government, is restricted to broadcasting advertising for four minutes per hour and no more than 15 minutes per day, of which only five minutes may be in prime time. There are also restrictions on the frequency of advertising breaks (for example, news and children's programs shorter than 30 minutes cannot be interrupted). These restrictions apply to both publicly and privately owned broadcasters. Further restrictions relate to advertising content, including a ban on tobacco advertising and restrictions on alcohol advertising, regulations on medical products advertising and regulations on advertising targeted at children or during children's programming. In addition, members of the news department of our channels are prohibited from appearing in advertisements. Our channels in Bulgaria are required to comply with several restrictions on programming, including regulations on the origin of programming. These channels must ensure that 50% of a channel's total annual broadcast time consists of EU- or locally-produced programming and 12% of such broadcast time consists of programming produced by independent producers in the EU. News, sports, games and teleshopping programs, as well as advertising and teletext services, are excluded from these restrictions.
Czech Republic: Privately owned broadcasters in the Czech Republic are permitted to broadcast advertising for up to 12 minutes per hour. In September 2011, legislation was implemented in the Czech Republic which restricts the amount of advertising that may be shown on channels of the public broadcaster, CT. Pursuant to the regulation, no advertising may be shown on the public channels CT 1 and CT 24, while the channels CT 2 and CT 4 may show a limited amount of advertising. Also included in the legislation is the requirement that national private broadcasters must contribute annually to a Czech cinematography fund in an amount equal to 2% of their net advertising revenues. We are entitled to apply for financing from the fund. In the Czech Republic, all broadcasters are restricted with respect to the frequency of advertising breaks during and between programs, as well as being subject to restrictions that relate to advertising content, including a ban on tobacco advertising and limitations on advertisements of alcoholic beverages, pharmaceuticals, firearms and munitions.
Romania: Privately owned broadcasters in Romania are permitted to broadcast advertising and direct sales advertising for up to 12 minutes per hour. There are also restrictions on the frequency of advertising breaks (for example, news and children's programs shorter than 30 minutes cannot be interrupted). Broadcasters are also required that from the total broadcasting time (except for the time allocated to news, sports events, games, advertising and teleshopping) (a) at least 50% must be European-origin audio-visual works and (b) at least 10% (or, alternatively, at least 10% of their programming budget) must be European audio-visual works produced by independent producers. The public broadcaster, TVR, is restricted to broadcasting advertising for eight minutes per hour and only between programs. Further restrictions relate to advertising content, including a ban on tobacco advertising and restrictions on alcohol advertising, and regulations on advertising targeted at children or during children's programming. In addition, news anchors of all channels are prohibited from appearing in advertisements and teleshopping programming. A new Audiovisual Code was enacted in March 2017 providing additional safeguards in connection with the protection of minors and privacy rights.
Slovak Republic: Privately owned broadcasters in the Slovak Republic are permitted to broadcast advertising for up to 12 minutes per hour but not for more than 20% of their total daily broadcast time. Since January 2013, the public broadcaster RTVS, which is financed through a compulsory license fee, can broadcast advertising for up to 0.5% of its total broadcast time (up to 2.5% of total broadcast time including teleshopping programming), but between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. may broadcast only eight minutes of advertising per hour. There are restrictions on the frequency of advertising breaks during and between programs. RTVS is not permitted to broadcast advertising breaks during programs. There are also restrictions that relate to advertising content, including a ban on tobacco, pharmaceuticals, firearms and munitions advertising and a ban on advertisements of alcoholic beverages (excluding beer and wine) between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Our operations in the Slovak Republic are also required to comply with several restrictions on programming, including regulations on the origin of programming. These include the requirement that 50% of the station's monthly broadcast time must be European-origin audio-visual works and at least 10% of a station's monthly broadcast time must be European audio-visual works produced by independent producers, at least 10% of which must be broadcast within five years of production.

Licensing Regulation
The license granting and renewal process in our operating countries varies by jurisdiction and by type of broadcast permitted by the license (i.e., terrestrial, cable, satellite). Depending on the country, terrestrial licenses may be valid for an unlimited time period, may be renewed automatically upon application or may require a more lengthy renewal procedure, such as a tender process. Generally cable and satellite licenses are granted or renewed upon application. We expect all of our licenses will continue to be renewed or new licenses to be granted as required to continue to operate our business. All of the countries in which we operate have transitioned from analog to digital terrestrial broadcasting and we have obtained digital licenses where requested. In January 2017, we ceased terrestrial distribution of our channels in the Slovak Republic, and channels are now available exclusively on cable, satellite and IPTV platforms. We will apply for additional digital licenses where such applications are prudent and permissible. Please see below for more detailed information on licenses for our channels.
