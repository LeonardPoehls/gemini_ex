Item 1. | Business

Andeavor Logistics LP (formerly Tesoro Logistics LP and referred to herein as “Andeavor Logistics” or the “Partnership”) is a leading growth-oriented, full-service, and diversified midstream company operating in the western and mid-continent regions of the United States. We were formed by Andeavor (formerly Tesoro Corporation) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tesoro Logistics GP, LLC (“TLGP”), our general partner, in December 2010 as a Delaware master limited partnership to own, operate, develop and acquire logistics assets. Following the name change on August 1, 2017, the Partnership’s common units trade on the NYSE under the symbol “ANDX.” 
We own and operate networks of crude oil, refined products and natural gas pipelines, terminals with crude oil and refined products storage capacity, rail loading and offloading facilities, marine terminals including storage, bulk petroleum distribution facilities, a trucking fleet and natural gas processing and fractionation complexes. Our assets are organized in three segments: Terminalling and Transportation, Gathering and Processing and Wholesale. 
The following provides an overview of our assets and operations in relation to Andeavor’s refineries:

2017 Acquisitions
WNRL Merger
Effective October 30, 2017, Andeavor Logistics merged with Western Refining Logistics, LP (“WNRL”) by exchanging all outstanding common units of WNRL with units of Andeavor Logistics (the “WNRL Merger”). Refer to our discussion of the WNRL Merger, including financial details relating to the WNRL Merger and concurrent equity restructuring of our general partner and IDR interests in Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. With the WNRL Merger, Andeavor Logistics expanded its asset base and operations as follows:

• | 705 miles of pipelines located in Permian Basin area of west Texas and southern New Mexico that gather and transport crude oil by pipeline, as well as by truck, from various production locations to Andeavor’s El Paso, Texas and Gallup, New Mexico refineries;


• | 12.4 million barrels of storage capacity, including approximately 11.4 million barrels of crude oil, feedstock, blendstock, refined product and asphalt storage tanks near Andeavor’s El Paso, Gallup and St. Paul Park, Minnesota refineries and approximately 1.0 million barrels of crude oil storage tanks located along the gathering pipeline systems discussed above; and


• | Wholesale fuel distribution business that purchases, sells, and transports gasoline and diesel to Andeavor’s retail sites or third parties.

As of December 31, 2017, integration of these assets and operations continues. However, the financial results for these WNRL assets have been included with the Partnership’s consolidated and segment operating results for 2017 on a recast basis back to June 1, 2017, the date of Andeavor’s acquisition of WNRL’s former parent, Western Refining, Inc. Refer to our discussion of each segment below for an understanding how WNRL’s assets and operations have been integrated with Andeavor Logistics’ existing operations. The wholesale fuel distribution business is a new business line for us and is separately presented in the new Wholesale segment. 
Anacortes Logistics Assets Acquisition
On November 8, 2017, we acquired from a subsidiary of Andeavor certain logistics assets located in Anacortes, Washington (the “Anacortes Logistics Assets”), that included 3.9 million barrels of storage for crude oil, feedstock and refined products at Andeavor’s Anacortes Refinery, the Anacortes marine terminal with 73 Mbpd of feedstock and refined product throughput, a manifest rail facility with 4 thousand barrels of throughput and crude oil and refined products pipelines with 111 Mbpd of throughput combined. 
North Dakota Gathering and Processing Assets
On January 1, 2017, we acquired crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering systems and two natural gas processing facilities (the “North Dakota Gathering and Processing Assets”) from Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation, GBK Investments, LLC and WBI Energy Midstream, LLC. The North Dakota Gathering and Processing Assets include over 650 miles of crude oil, natural gas, and produced water gathering pipelines, 170 MMcf per day of natural gas processing capacity and 18.7 Mbpd of fractionation capacity in the Sanish and Pronghorn fields of the Williston Basin in North Dakota. With this acquisition, we expanded the assets in our Gathering and Processing segment located in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota to further grow our integrated, full-service logistics capabilities in support of third-party demand for crude oil, natural gas and water gathering services as well as natural gas processing services. In addition, this extends our capacity and capabilities by adding new origin and destination points for our common carrier pipelines in North Dakota and extends our crude oil, natural gas and water gathering and associated gas processing footprint to enhance and improve overall basin logistics efficiencies.
Commercial Agreements
Percentage of Affiliate and Third-Party Revenues by Operating Segment during 2017
 

December 31, 2017 | 5


Business

Andeavor
Andeavor accounted for $1.4 billion, or 44%, of our total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017.
We process gas for certain producers under keep-whole processing agreements. Under a keep-whole agreement, normally a producer would transfer title of the NGLs produced during gas processing and the processor, in exchange, would deliver to the producer natural gas with a BTU content equivalent to the NGLs that would be removed. However, Andeavor Logistics entered into an agreement with Andeavor, which transfers the commodity risk exposure associated with these keep-whole processing agreements from Andeavor Logistics to Andeavor (the “Keep-Whole Commodity Agreement”). Under the Keep-Whole Commodity Agreement, Andeavor pays Andeavor Logistics a processing fee for NGLs related to keep-whole agreements and delivers the replaced natural gas to the producers on behalf of Andeavor Logistics. Andeavor Logistics pays Andeavor a marketing fee in exchange for assuming the commodity risk. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our keep-whole agreements.
We have various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with Andeavor, under which we provide pipeline transportation, trucking, terminal distribution, storage services and coke handling services to Andeavor. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our commercial agreements.
Third-Parties
Third-party revenues accounted for $1.8 billion, or 56%, of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
Working Capital
We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, we have an available revolving line of credit and we may issue additional debt or equity securities for additional working capital or capital expenditures. See “Capital Resources and Liquidity” in Item 7 for additional information regarding working capital.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we directly employed 518 employees through our wholesale subsidiary. The remainder of our employees that conduct our business are employed by our general partner and its affiliates. We had over 1,900 employees performing services for our operations as of December 31, 2017, approximately 250 of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire on February 1, 2019.
Website Access to Reports and Other Information
Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other public filings with the SEC are available, free of charge, on our website (http://andeavorlogistics.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them with, or furnish them to, the SEC. Information contained on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You may also access these reports on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.

  Terminalling and Transportation 
Our Terminalling and Transportation segment consists of the following assets and operations:

Asset | Number of Terminals | Location | Key Products Handled | Volume Source | Terminalling Throughput Capacity (Mbpd) | Storage Capacity (thousand barrels) | Pipeline Mileage
Land Terminals | 44 | AK, AZ, CA, ID, MN, NM, TX, UT, WA | Crude Oil, Refined Products, Asphalt | Andeavor, Third-Party | 1,263 | | 44,957 | — 
Marine Terminals | 6 | CA, WA | Crude Oil, Refined Products | Andeavor, Third-Party | 955 | | 2,900 | — 
Northwest Products System | — | ID, UT, WA | Refined Products | Andeavor, Third-Party | — | | — | 1,201
Southern California System | — | CA | Crude Oil, Natural Gas, Refined Product | Andeavor, Third-Party | — | | — | 216 
Kenai Pipeline | — | AK | Refined Products | Andeavor | — | | — | 74 
Salt Lake City Short-haul | — | UT | Crude Oil, Refined Products | Andeavor | — | | — | 22 
Petroleum Coke Handling (a) | 1 | CA | Petroleum Coke | Andeavor | — | | — | — 
 | 51 | | | | 2,218 | | 47,857 | 1,513


(a) | Our Petroleum Coke handling facility has capacity of 2,600 metric tons per day.

Our Terminalling and Transportation segment generates revenues by charging our customers fees for: 

• | providing storage services;


• | transporting refined products;


• | delivering crude oil, refined products and intermediate feedstocks from vessels to refineries and terminals;


• | loading and unloading crude oil transported by unit train to Andeavor’s Anacortes refinery;


• | loading and unloading from marine vessels and barges;


• | transferring refined products from terminals to trucks, barges, rail cars and pipelines;


• | providing ancillary services, ethanol blending and additive injection; and


• | handling petroleum coke for Andeavor’s Los Angeles refinery.

We typically enter into long-term contractual arrangements with customers for the provision of services. Many of these contracts have minimum volume commitments that must be met by the customer over a period of time. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 90% of our total shell capacity is dedicated. These commitments and dedications provide our Terminalling and Transportation business with stable, fee-based cash flow limiting the impact of seasonality on our business. 
Andeavor is our largest customer. We derived 92% of Terminalling and Transportation revenues from Andeavor and its affiliates, most of which were derived from contracts that include minimum volume commitments, and have provided approximately 43.1 million barrels of dedicated storage capacity for Andeavor under various agreements. 
WNRL Assets and Operations
Through the WNRL Merger and the realignment of our operating segments discussed in Items 7 and 8, the Terminalling and Transportation segment includes the following WNRL assets and related operations included in the table above:

• | Refined products terminals located in El Paso, Texas; Albuquerque, Bloomfield and Gallup, New Mexico; and St. Paul Park, Minnesota. The terminals distribute refined products supplied by an Andeavor refinery through truck loading racks, barge facilities, rail and other logistics assets;


• | Storage facilities located in El Paso, Gallup and St. Paul Park. Each facility is located adjacent to an Andeavor refinery and provides storage and transfer services required to support the refinery’s operations; and


• | Asphalt terminalling and processing services at our asphalt plant and terminal in El Paso, as well as at three stand-alone asphalt terminals in Albuquerque and Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona. Our El Paso asphalt plant is located adjacent to Andeavor’s El Paso refinery. We also operate a fleet of asphalt trucks, which are utilized to deliver asphalt to Andeavor's asphalt terminals and third-party customers.


December 31, 2017 | 7


Business

Competition
Our competition primarily comes from independent terminal and pipeline companies, integrated petroleum companies, refining and marketing companies and distribution companies with marketing and trading arms. Competition in particular geographic areas is affected primarily by the volumes of refined products produced by refineries located in those areas, the availability of refined products and the cost of transportation to those areas from refineries located in other areas.
We may compete with third-party terminals for volumes in excess of minimum volume commitments under our commercial agreements with Andeavor and third-party customers as other terminals and pipelines may be able to supply Andeavor’s refineries or end user markets on a more competitive basis, due to terminal location, price, versatility and services provided. If Andeavor’s customers reduced their purchases of refined products from Andeavor due to the increased availability of less expensive product from other suppliers or for other reasons, Andeavor may only receive or deliver the minimum volumes through our terminals (or pay the shortfall payment if it does not deliver the minimum volumes), which would decrease our revenues.
Safety
Terminal Safety
Terminal operations are subject to regulations under OSHA and comparable state and local regulations. Our terminal facilities are operated in a manner consistent with industry safe practices and standards. The storage tanks that are at our terminals are designed for crude oil and refined products and are equipped with appropriate controls that minimize emissions and promote safety. Our terminal facilities have response and control plans, spill prevention and other programs to respond to emergencies. Our terminals are regulated under the Homeland Standards or USCG Transportation Act, which are designed to regulate the security of high-risk chemical facilities.
Pipeline Safety
Our pipelines, gathering systems and terminal operations are subject to increasingly strict safety laws and regulations. The transportation and storage of refined products, natural gas and crude oil involve a risk that hazardous liquids or natural gas may be released into the environment, potentially causing harm to the public or the environment. The U.S. Department of Transportation, through the PHMSA and state agencies, enforces safety regulations governing the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of our pipeline and storage facilities. These regulations require the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and the investigation of anomalies and if necessary, corrective action. These regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans, including extensive spill response training for pipeline personnel.
We may incur significant costs and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, preventative or mitigation measures associated with our pipelines. These costs and liabilities might relate to repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, as well as lost cash flows resulting from shutting down our pipelines during such repairs. Additionally, if we fail to comply with PHMSA or comparable state regulations, we could be subject to penalties and fines. If future PHMSA regulations impose new regulatory requirements on our assets, the costs associated with compliance could have a material effect on our operations.
While we operate and maintain our pipelines consistent with applicable regulatory and industry standards, we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, which could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations to pipelines and gathering lines not previously subject to such requirements. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to comply with new requirements, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations.
Rail Safety
Our rail operations are limited to loading and unloading rail cars at our facilities. Generally, rail operations are subject to federal, state and local regulations. We believe our rail car loading and unloading operations meet or exceed all applicable regulations.

  Gathering and Processing
Our Gathering and Processing segment consists of the following assets and operations:

System | Location | Key Products Handled | Volume Source | Processing Throughput Capacity (a)(MMcf/d) | Pipeline Mileage (b)
High Plains | MT, ND | Crude Oil | Andeavor, Third-Party | — | | 1,035
Southwest | NM, TX | Crude Oil | Andeavor, Third-Party | — | | 913 
North Dakota | ND | Crude Oil, Natural Gas, Produced Water | Andeavor, Third-Party | 170 | | 780 
Uinta Basin | UT | Natural Gas | Andeavor, Third-Party | 650 | | 635 
Green River | WY | Crude Oil, Natural Gas | Andeavor, Third-Party | 850 | | 587 
Vermillion | CO, UT, WY | Natural Gas | Third-Party | 57 | | 482 
 | | | | 1,727 | | 4,432


(a) | We have fractionation throughput capacity at our Blacks Fork complex, Robinson Lake complex and Belfield complex of 15.0 Mbpd, 11.5 Mbpd and 7.2 Mbpd, respectively.


(b) | The pipeline mileage associated with our equity method investments is not included in the table. Our equity method investments are discussed below.

We generate gathering and processing revenues by charging our customers fees for:

• | gathering and transporting crude oil, natural gas and produced water;


• | operating storage facilities with tanks located in strategic areas;


• | operating truck-based crude oil gathering; and


• | processing gas under fee-based processing and percentage-of-proceeds agreements.

Certain equity method investments that contribute to our gathering and processing systems including investments in:

• | RGS which operates the infrastructure that transports gas along 333 miles of pipeline from certain fields to several re-delivery points, including natural gas processing facilities that are owned by Andeavor Logistics or a third party;


• | TRG which transports natural gas across 52 miles of pipeline to our natural gas processing facilities in the Uinta Basin; and


• | UBFS which operates 78 miles of gathering pipeline and gas compression assets located in the southeastern Uinta Basin.

We derived 24% of Gathering and Processing revenues from Andeavor and its affiliates. We process gas for certain producers under keep-whole processing agreements. Approximately 23% of our processing throughput capacity is currently supported by long-term, fee-based processing agreements with minimum volume commitments. 
WNRL Assets and Operations
Through the WNRL Merger and the realignment of our operating segments discussed in Items 7 and 8, the Gathering and Processing segment includes the following WNRL assets and related operations included in the table above:

• | Four Corners System - A pipeline system which includes pipelines in Northwestern New Mexico that gather and transport crude oil and condensate produced in the Four Corners area and deliver it to Andeavor’s Gallup refinery or to the TexNew Mex pipeline system. This Four Corners area crude oil is received at our Bloomfield terminal and at crude oil stations we own located in Bisti, Lybrook, Pettigrew and Star Lake, New Mexico;


• | Permian Basin System - A pipeline system which includes the Delaware Basin system and other crude oil gathering assets in West Texas. It consists of 39 miles of pipelines located in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas and handles crude oil produced in the Delaware Basin. The system includes other crude gathering assets in West Texas that handle crude oil produced in the Permian Basin. The TexNew Mex pipeline extends 299 miles from our Four Corners system to the Delaware Basin; and


• | Crude Trucking - A fleet of crude oil trucks, which are utilized to gather, transport and deliver crude oil from collection points in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah to Andeavor’s El Paso and Gallup refineries and their interconnected pipelines.

Business

Our natural gas operations are affected by seasonal weather conditions and certain access restrictions imposed by the BLM on federal lands to protect migratory and breeding patterns of native species. During the winter months, our customers typically reduce drilling and completion activities due to adverse weather conditions. Also, access restrictions imposed by the BLM reduce our ability to complete expansion projects and connect to newly completed wells. We mitigate these seasonal risks in affected areas through prudent planning and coordination with our customers to ensure expansion projects are completed prior to these periods. Condensate sales, however, tend to increase in the first quarter of each year, as the colder ground causes more condensates to fall out of the gas stream in our gathering system. However, this impact is minimal and we expect such seasonality to diminish as we continue to expand our existing assets or acquire additional assets outside of the affected areas.
Competition
Our common carrier crude oil gathering and transport systems consist of common carrier pipelines in North Dakota and Montana (“High Plains System”) and common carrier pipelines in New Mexico and Texas (“Southwest System”), which gather and transport crude oil into major regional takeaway pipelines and refining centers, which compete with a number of transportation companies for gathering and transporting crude oil produced in the Bakken Shale/Williston Basin area of North Dakota and Montana (“Bakken Region”) and the Delaware and Midland Basins (“Southwest Region”), respectively. We may also compete for opportunities to build gathering lines from producers or other pipeline companies. Other companies have existing pipelines that are available to ship crude oil and continue to (or have announced their intent to) expand their pipeline systems in the Bakken and Southwest Regions. We also compete with third-party carriers that deliver crude oil by truck.

Although we compete for third-party shipments of crude oil on our High Plains System and Southwest System, our contractual relationship with Andeavor under our High Plains transportation services agreement (the “High Plains Pipeline Transportation Services Agreement”), Southwest pipeline and gathering services agreement (the “Southwest Pipeline and Gathering Services Agreement”) and our connection to Andeavor’s refineries provide us a strong competitive position in the regions. 

Our competitors for natural gas gathering and processing include other midstream companies and producers. Competition for natural gas volumes and processing is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, flexibility, access to markets, location, available capacity, capital expenditures and fuel efficiencies. In addition to competing for crude oil and natural gas volumes, we face competition for customer markets, which is primarily based on the proximity of the pipelines to the markets, price and assurance of supply.
Safety

Our natural gas processing plants and operations are subject to safety regulations under OSHA and comparable state and local requirements. A number of our natural gas processing facilities are also subject to OSHA’s process safety management regulations and the EPA’s risk management plan requirements. Together these regulations are designed to prevent or minimize the probability and consequences of an accidental release of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. A number of our facilities are also regulated under the Homeland Standards, which are designed to regulate the security of high-risk chemical facilities. Our natural gas processing plants and operations are operated in a manner consistent with industry safe practices and standards.
 Wholesale

Our Wholesale segment includes the operations of several bulk petroleum distribution plants and a fleet of refined product delivery trucks that distribute commercial wholesale petroleum products primarily in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. This business includes the operation of a fleet of finished products trucks that deliver a significant portion of the volumes sold by our Wholesale segment.
The Wholesale segment purchases petroleum fuels from Andeavor's refining segment and from third-party suppliers. We have entered into a product supply agreement, as amended, with Andeavor and certain of its affiliates, pursuant to which Andeavor has agreed to sell, and we have agreed to buy, between 90% and 110% of 79 Mbpd of Andeavor’s refined products based upon forecasts provided each month by us. The products are purchased according to a predetermined formula based upon OPIS or Platts indices on the day of delivery and the applicable terminal location. Andeavor will provide us margin shortfall support for non-delivered rack sales. The product supply agreement contains customary payment terms that may be extended if our net working capital requirements grow significantly over time.
In addition to our sales to Andeavor, our principal customers are retail fuel distributors and the mining, construction, utility, manufacturing, transportation, aviation and agricultural industries. Our sales and services to Andeavor generally accounted for 31% of our fuel sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2017.
As part of this fuel distributions business, we have entered into a fuel distribution and supply agreement with Andeavor. Under this arrangement, we are required to sell and deliver to Andeavor, and Andeavor is required to purchase and accept delivery 

10 |


Business

from us, approximately 21 Mbpd of branded and unbranded motor fuels to Andeavor retail and cardlock locations in the Southwest. In exchange for the sale and delivery of branded and unbranded motor fuels, Andeavor will pay us an amount equal to our product cost at each terminal, plus applicable taxes and fees, actual transportation costs and a margin of $0.03 per gallon. In the event that Andeavor fails to purchase the committed volume of branded and unbranded motor fuels, Andeavor will pay $0.03 per gallon for each gallon below the committed volume. Andeavor will receive a credit for excess volumes purchased in subsequent months to the extent that shortfall payments were made in the prior twelve months. Our net cost per gallon will be determined based on the prices paid under the product supply agreement.

Competition

Our competition primarily comes from other wholesale petroleum products distributors on product sales pricing and distribution services in the Southwest.
Rate and Other Regulations
General Interstate Regulation
Our High Plains Pipeline, Northwest Products Pipeline, Four Corners system, Permian Basin system, and other interstate pipelines are common carriers subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The FERC regulates interstate transportation on our crude oil transportation and gathering pipelines and Northwest Products Pipeline under the ICA, the EPAct, and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on oil pipelines, including interstate pipelines that transport crude oil and refined products (collectively, “Petroleum Pipelines”), be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory, and that we file such rates and terms and conditions of service with the FERC. Under the ICA, shippers may challenge new or existing rates or services. The FERC is authorized to suspend the effectiveness of a challenged rate for up to seven months, though rates are typically not suspended for the maximum allowable period. A successful rate challenge could result in Petroleum Pipelines paying refunds for the period that the rate was in effect and/or reparations for up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint. There are no pending challenges or complaints regarding our current tariff rates.
Certain interstate Petroleum Pipeline rates in effect at the inception of the EPAct are deemed to be just and reasonable under the ICA. These rates are referred to as grandfathered rates. Our rates for interstate transportation service on the Northwest Products Pipeline are grandfathered. The FERC allows for an annual rate change under its indexing methodology, which applies to transportation on our High Plains Pipeline and Northwest Products Pipeline.
We own a natural gas pipeline in Wyoming. Under the NGA, FERC has authority to regulate natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce. Federal regulation of interstate pipelines extends to such matters as rates, services, and terms and conditions of service; the types of services offered to customers; the certification and construction of new facilities; the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of facilities; the maintenance of accounts and records; relationships between affiliated companies involved in certain aspects of the natural gas business; the initiation and continuation of services; market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas; and participation by interstate pipelines in cash management arrangements. The FERC prohibits natural gas companies from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service. Under the NGA, the rates for service on interstate facilities must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory. The FERC has granted the Rendezvous Pipeline Company, LLC (“Rendezvous Pipeline”) market-based rate authority, subject to certain reporting requirements. If the FERC were to suspend Rendezvous Pipeline’s market-based rate authority, it could have an adverse impact on our revenue associated with the transportation service.
Intrastate Regulation
The intrastate operations of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the NDPSC, the Regulatory Commission of Alaska, the NMPRC and the TRC. Applicable state law requires that:

• | pipelines operate as common carriers;


• | access to transportation services and pipeline rates be non-discriminatory;


• | transported crude oil volumes be apportioned without unreasonable discrimination if more crude oil is offered for transportation than can be transported immediately; and


• | pipeline rates be just and reasonable.

Pipelines
We operate our crude oil gathering pipelines and the Northwest Products Pipeline as common carriers pursuant to tariffs filed with the FERC, the NDPSC for the High Plains Pipeline, the NMPRC for the Four Corners system and the TRC and NMPRC for the Permian Basin system. The High Plains Pipeline offers tariffs from various locations in Montana and North Dakota to a variety of destinations, which are utilized by Andeavor and various third parties. Andeavor has historically shipped the majority of the volumes transported on the High Plains Pipeline, which is expected to continue in 2018. The Northwest Products Pipeline extends from Salt Lake City, Utah to Spokane, Washington and offers tariffs from various locations to a variety of destinations, 

December 31, 2017 | 11


Business

which serves both third-party customers and Andeavor. We have additional pipelines that provide gathering of condensate in Wyoming and other pipelines that provide crude oil gathering in North Dakota.
The FERC and state regulatory agencies generally have not investigated rates on their own initiative absent a protest or a complaint by a shipper. Andeavor has agreed not to contest our tariff rates for the term of our commercial agreements. However, our pipelines are common carrier pipelines, and we may be required to accept additional third-party shippers who wish to transport through our system. The FERC, NDPSC, NMPRC or TRC could investigate our rates at any time. If an interstate rate for service on our pipelines were investigated, the challenger would have to establish that there has been a substantial change since the enactment of the EPAct, in either the economic circumstances or the nature of the service that formed the basis for the rate. If our rates are investigated, the inquiry could result in a comparison of our rates to those charged by others or to an investigation of our costs.
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the FERC’s jurisdiction. Although the FERC has not made formal determinations with respect to all of the facilities we consider to be gathering facilities, we believe that our natural gas pipelines meet the FERC’s traditional tests to determine that they are gathering pipelines and are, therefore, not subject to FERC jurisdiction.
States may regulate gathering pipelines. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based regulation. Our natural gas and crude oil gathering operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in most of the states in which we operate. These statutes generally require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas or crude oil without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. The regulations under these statutes can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas or crude oil. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. To date, there has been no adverse effect to our systems due to these regulations.
Environmental Regulations
General
Our operations of pipelines, terminals and associated facilities in connection with the storage and transportation of crude oil, refined products and biofuels as well as our operations of gathering, processing and associated facilities related to the movement of natural gas are subject to extensive and frequently-changing federal, state and local laws, regulations, permits and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment. Among other things, these laws and regulations govern obtaining and maintaining construction and operating permits, the emission or discharge of pollutants into or onto the land, air and water, the handling and disposal of solid, liquid, salt water and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate and upgrade equipment and facilities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. These requirements may also significantly affect our customers’ operations and may have an indirect effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. However, we do not expect such effects will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Under the Fourth Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement (“Amended Omnibus Agreement”) and the Carson Assets Indemnity Agreement, Andeavor indemnifies us for certain matters, including environmental, title and tax matters associated with the ownership of our assets at or before the closing of the Initial Offering and the subsequent acquisitions from Andeavor. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 for additional information regarding the Amended Omnibus Agreement and Carson Assets Indemnity Agreement.
Air Emissions and Climate Change Regulations
Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local statutes. Under these laws, permits may be required before construction can commence on a new source of potentially significant air emissions, and operating permits may be required for sources that are already constructed. If regulations become more stringent, additional emission control technologies may be required to be installed at our facilities and our ability to secure future permits may become less certain. Any such future obligations could require us to incur significant additional capital or operating costs.
The EPA has undertaken significant regulatory initiatives under authority of the Clean Air Act’s NSR/PSD program in an effort to further reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. These regulatory initiatives have been targeted at industries with large manufacturing facilities that are significant sources of emissions, such as refining, paper and pulp, and electric power generating industries. The basic premise of these initiatives is the EPA’s assertion that many of these industrial establishments have modified or expanded their operations over time without complying with NSR/PSD regulations adopted by the EPA that require permits and new emission controls in connection with any significant facility modifications or expansions that can result in emission increases above certain thresholds. As part of this ongoing NSR/PSD

Business

regulatory initiative, the EPA has entered into consent decrees with several refiners, including Andeavor, that require the refiners to make significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment at selected facilities. However, we do not expect any additional requirements will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
On October 1, 2015, EPA strengthened the NAAQS for ground-level ozone to 70 ppb from the 75 ppb level set in 2008. To implement the revised ozone NAAQS, all states will need to review their existing air quality management infrastructure State Implementation Plan for ozone and ensure it is appropriate and adequate. Where areas remain in ozone non-attainment, or come into ozone non-attainment as a result of the revised NAAQS it is likely that additional planning and control obligations will be required. States may impose additional emissions control requirements on stationary sources, changes in fuels specifications, and changes in fuels mix and mobile source emissions controls. The ongoing and potential future requirements imposed by states to meet the ozone NAAQS could have direct impacts on terminalling facilities through additional requirements and increased permitting costs, and could have indirect impacts through changing or decreasing fuel demand.
The Energy Independence and Security Act was enacted into federal law in December 2007 creating RFS2 requiring the total volume of renewable transportation fuels (including ethanol and advanced biofuels) sold or introduced in the U.S. to reach 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. The ongoing and increasing requirements for renewable fuels in RFS2 could reduce future demand for petroleum products and thereby have an indirect effect on certain aspects of our business, although it could increase demand for our ethanol and biodiesel fuel blending services at our truck loading racks.
Currently, multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation. These include actions to develop national, state or regional programs, each of which could require reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions or those of Andeavor and our other customers. On October 22, 2015, the EPA finalized amendments to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems source category (Subpart W) of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, including adding a new Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting segment, which will include greenhouse gas emissions from equipment and sources within the petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting systems. In September 2015, the EPA announced proposed new source performance standards for methane (a greenhouse gas) for new and modified oil and gas sector sources. These and other legislative regulatory measures will impose additional burdens on our business and those of Andeavor and our other customers.
Hazardous Substances and Waste Regulations
To a large extent, the environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into soils, groundwater, and surface water, and include measures to control pollution of the environment. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. They also require corrective action, including investigation and remediation, at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed. For instance, the CERCLA, and comparable state laws, impose liability, without regard to fault or to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances found at the site.
Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. In the course of our ordinary operations, we generate waste that falls within CERCLA’s definition of a hazardous substance and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites. Costs for these remedial actions, if any, as well as any related claims are all covered by indemnities from Andeavor to the extent the release occurred or existed before the close of the Initial Offering and subsequent acquisitions from Andeavor. Neither the Partnership nor Andeavor are currently engaged in any CERCLA related claims.
We also generate solid and liquid wastes, including hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the RCRA and comparable state statutes. From time to time, the EPA considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes, including wastes generated from the transportation and storage of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products. We are not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of the RCRA requirements because the majority of our facilities operate as small quantity generators of hazardous wastes by the EPA and state regulations. However, it is possible that additional wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during operations, will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes. Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes. On November 28, 2016, the EPA published the final Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule. This rule provided some additional flexibility for small generators but also increased certain recordkeeping and administrative burdens. Several states are now in the process of adopting the new rule. Any additional changes in the regulations could increase our capital or operating costs.
We acquired two salt water disposal wells located in North Dakota on January 1, 2017. These facilities are permitted under state regulations to accept produced water and fluids or waters from drilling and gas plant operations. These fluids are considered exempt from RCRA requirements per the E&P exemption. Changes to state or federal regulations regarding the E&P exemption or rules for the operation of disposal wells could impose additional burdens on our business.

Business

We currently own and lease properties where crude oil, refined petroleum hydrocarbons and fuel additives, such as methyl tertiary butyl ether and ethanol have been handled for many years by previous owners. At some facilities, hydrocarbons or other waste may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed or released wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including impacted groundwater), or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination to the extent we are not indemnified for such matters.
Water Pollution Regulations
Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants, including chemical components of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products. Many of our facilities operate near environmentally sensitive waters, where tanker, pipeline and other petroleum product transportation operations are regulated by federal, state and local agencies and monitored by environmental interest groups. The transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products over and adjacent to water involves risk and subjects us to the provisions in some cases of the OPA 90, and in all cases to related state requirements. These requirements can subject owners of covered facilities to strict, joint, and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of an oil spill where the spill is into navigable waters, along shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. In the event of an oil spill into navigable waters, substantial liabilities could be imposed upon us. States in which we operate have also enacted similar, or in some cases, more stringent laws.
Regulations under the Clean Water Act, OPA 90 and state laws also impose additional regulatory burdens on our operations. Spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws and state laws require containment to mitigate or prevent contamination of waters in the event of a crude oil, natural gas, NGLs or refined products overflow, rupture, or leak from above-ground pipelines and storage tanks. The Clean Water Act requires us to maintain spill prevention control and countermeasure plans at our facilities with above-ground storage tanks and pipelines. In addition, OPA 90 requires that most oil transport and storage companies maintain and update various oil spill prevention and oil spill contingency plans. We maintain such plans, and where required have submitted plans and received federal and state approvals necessary to comply with OPA 90, the Clean Water Act and related regulations. Our crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined product spill prevention plans and procedures are frequently reviewed and modified to prevent crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined product releases and to minimize potential impacts should a release occur. At our facilities adjacent to water, federally certified OSROs are available to respond to a spill on water from above ground storage tanks or pipelines. We have contracts in place to ensure support from the respective OSROs for spills in both open and inland waters.
The OSROs are capable of responding to a spill on water equal to the greatest volume of the largest above ground storage tank at our facilities. Those volumes range from 5,000 barrels to 125,000 barrels. The OSROs have the highest available rating and certification from the USCG and are required to annually demonstrate their response capability to the USCG and state agencies. The OSROs rated and certified to respond to open water spills (which include those OSROs with which we contract at our marine terminals that have received the highest available rating and certification from the USCG) must demonstrate the capability to recover up to 50,000 barrels of oil per day and store up to 100,000 barrels of recovered oil at any given time. The OSROs rated and certified to respond to inland spills must demonstrate the capability to recover up to 7,500 barrels of oil per day and store up to 15,000 barrels of recovered oil at any given time.
At each of our facilities, we maintain spill-response capability to mitigate the impact of a spill from our facilities until either an OSRO or other contracted service providers can deploy, and Andeavor has entered into contracts with various parties to provide spill response services augmenting that capability, if required. Our spill response capability at our marine terminals meets the USCG and state requirements to either deploy on-water containment equipment two times the length of a vessel at our dock or have smaller vessels available. Our spill response capabilities at our other facilities meet applicable federal and state requirements. In addition, we contract with various spill-response specialists to ensure appropriate expertise is available for such contingencies. We believe these contracts provide the additional services necessary to meet or exceed all regulatory spill-response requirements.
The Clean Water Act also imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. In certain locations, we contract with third parties for wastewater disposal. Our remaining facilities may have portions of their wastewater reclaimed by Andeavor’s nearby refineries. In the event regulatory requirements change, or interpretations of current requirements change, and our facilities are required to undertake different wastewater management arrangements, we could incur substantial additional costs. The Clean Water Act and RCRA can both impose substantial potential liability for the violation of permits or permitting requirements and for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages resulting from such discharges. In addition, states maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater.
Tribal Lands
Various federal agencies, including the EPA and the Department of the Interior, along with certain Native American tribes, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on Native American tribal lands where we operate.

These regulations include such matters as lease provisions, drilling and production requirements, and standards to protect environmental quality and cultural resources. For example, the EPA has established a preconstruction permitting program for new and modified minor sources throughout Indian country, and new and modified major sources in nonattainment areas in Indian country effective March 2016. In addition, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce certain laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands and impact the viability of, or prevent or delay our ability to conduct, our gathering operations on such lands.
Hydraulic Fracturing
We do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, but substantially all of our customers’ natural gas and crude oil production requires hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and natural gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural-gas commissions, but the EPA and other federal agencies have asserted federal regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. 
If additional levels of regulation and permits are required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal, state or local level that could lead to delays, increased operating costs and prohibitions for producers who drill near our pipelines, which could reduce the volumes of crude oil and natural gas available to move through our gathering systems and processing facilities, which could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
