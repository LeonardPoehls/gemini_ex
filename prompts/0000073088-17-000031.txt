ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

OVERVIEW


NorthWestern Corporation, doing business as NorthWestern Energy, provides electricity and natural gas to approximately 709,600 customers in Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. We have generated and distributed electricity in South Dakota and distributed natural gas in South Dakota and Nebraska since 1923 and have generated and distributed electricity and distributed natural gas in Montana since 2002.
We operate our business in the following reporting segments:


• | Electric operations;


• | Natural gas operations;


• | All other, which primarily consists of unallocated corporate costs.

We seek to maintain attractive rates for our customers. As rates are largely cost-based, maintaining low rates requires a strategy focused on developing and maintaining a low-cost position. Our average residential customer bill is below the national average benchmark.

Environmental Stewardship
We strive to balance statutory requirements to provide cost-effective, reliable and stably priced energy with being good stewards of natural resources, with a diligent focus on sustainability. We own a mix of clean and carbon-free energy resources balanced with traditional energy sources that help us deliver affordable and reliable electricity to our customers 24/7. Our policies support both the role of cost-effective energy efficiency and the potential value of low or carbon-free resources as part of our diverse supply portfolio. In 2016, approximately 54%, based on megawatt hours generated, of our total company-owned generating assets and contracted electric supply is carbon-free. During 2015 and 2014, we added more than $1 billion of carbon-free electric generation, including the Montana run-of-the-river hydro system and wind generation in South Dakota.

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS

Montana
Our regulated electric utility business in Montana includes generation, transmission and distribution. Our service territory covers approximately 107,600 square miles, representing approximately 73% of Montana's land area, and includes a 2015 census estimated population of approximately 905,600. As of year-end 2016, we delivered electricity to approximately 363,800 customers in 187 communities and their surrounding rural areas, 15 rural electric cooperatives and, in Wyoming, to the Yellowstone National Park. In 2016, by category, residential, commercial, industrial, and other sales accounted for approximately 40%, 50%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of our Montana retail electric utility revenue. We also transmit electricity for nonregulated entities owning generation, and utilities, cooperatives, and power marketers serving the Montana electricity market. Our total control area peak demand was approximately 1,808 MWs on December 17, 2016, which was a new all-time peak. Our control area average demand for 2016 was approximately 1,239 MWs per hour, with total energy delivered of more than 10.8 million MWHs. 

Our Montana electric distribution system consists of approximately 17,750 miles of overhead and underground distribution lines and 393 transmission and distribution substations. Our Montana electric transmission system consists of approximately 6,700 miles of transmission lines, ranging from 50 kV to 500 kV, 288 circuit segments and approximately 104,000 transmission poles on approximately 74,000 structures with associated transformation and terminal facilities, and extends throughout the western two-thirds of Montana from Colstrip in the east to Thompson Falls in the west. We are directly interconnected with Avista Corporation; Idaho Power Company; PacifiCorp; the Bonneville Power Administration; WAPA; and Montana Alberta Tie Ltd. Such interconnections, coupled with transmission line capacity made available under agreements with some of the above entities, permit the interchange, purchase, and sale of power among all major electric systems in the west interconnecting with the winter-peaking northern and summer-peaking southern regions of the western power system. We provide wholesale transmission service and firm and non-firm transmission services for eligible transmission customers. Our 500 kV transmission system, which is jointly owned, along with our 230 kV and 161 kV facilities, form the key assets of our Montana transmission system. Lower voltage systems, which range from 50 kV to 115 kV, provide for local area service needs. 
Energy Sources and Resource Planning
Resource planning is an important function necessary to meet our future energy needs. We filed a biennial Electric Supply Resource Procurement Plan with the MPSC during 2016, which guides future resource acquisition activities. Due to our acquisition of the hydroelectric generating facilities in Montana during 2014, adding additional base-load capacity was not identified as a priority. Instead, this plan identified meeting customers' peak requirements as the primary need. A scenario with new gas generation was identified as the most reliable, economical, lowest risk, and affordable means of serving our customers, consistent with state law. The benefits from this scenario hold true even assuming a high cost of carbon. The plan identifies a number of follow-up actions, one of which is to conduct a competitive solicitation in which all types of generation are allowed to participate. From this solicitation, we will identify the lowest cost/lowest risk means of meeting the portfolio's requirements and the most affordable and reliable ways of addressing our customers' peak needs.
The following charts depict the makeup of our current Montana portfolio. Hydro generation is by far our largest and most important resource, as it is reliable, dramatically lowers the portfolio's carbon intensity, and reduces economic risks associated with future carbon costs.

Our annual retail electric supply load requirements averaged approximately 735 MWs, with a peak load of approximately 1,200 MWs, and are supplied by owned and contracted resources and market purchases with multiple counterparties. Owned generation resources supplied approximately 60% of our retail load requirements for 2016. We expect that approximately 60% of our retail obligations will be met by owned generation in 2017 as well. We also purchase power from QFs, which provide a total of 321 MWs of contracted capacity, including 87 MWs of capacity from waste petroleum coke and waste coal, 192 MWs of capacity from wind, 16 MWs of capacity from hydro, and 26 MWs of capacity from solar projects, located in Montana. We have several other long and medium-term power purchase agreements including contracts for 135 MWs of wind generation and 21 MWs of seasonal base-load hydro supply. For 2017, including both owned and contracted resources, we have resources to provide over 90% of the energy requirements necessary to meet our forecasted retail load requirements. 
Generation Facilities


In 2014, we completed the purchase of hydroelectric generating facilities and associated assets located in Montana (Hydro Transaction). The Hydro Transaction included temporary ownership of the Kerr Project until it was conveyed to the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation on September 5, 2015. The remaining hydro facilities are listed in the table below.

(1) Hebgen facility (0 MW net capacity) excluded from figures. These are run-of-river dams except for Mystic, which is storage generation.
We have a 30% joint ownership interest in Colstrip Unit 4, a coal-fired generating unit that provides base-load supply and is operated by Talen Energy. Talen Energy has a 30% joint ownership interest in Colstrip Unit 3. We have a risk sharing agreement with Talen Energy regarding the operation of Colstrip Units 3 and 4, in which each party receives 15% of the respective combined output and is responsible for 15% of the respective operating and construction costs, regardless of whether a particular cost is specified to Colstrip Unit 3 or 4. However, each party is responsible for its own fuel-related costs. Colstrip Unit 4 is supplied with fuel from adjacent coal reserves under coal supply and transportation agreements in effect through 2019. We also own the 40 MW Spion Kop wind project. The capacity of Spion Kop represents the nameplate MW, which varies from actual energy expected to be received as wind generation resources are highly dependent upon weather conditions. 
We also own the Dave Gates Generating Station at Mill Creek (DGGS), a 150 MW natural gas fired facility. In 2016, DGGS typically operated with one unit providing regulation service, one unit providing other intra-hour balancing, and the third unit providing contingency reserves. In addition, DGGS provided approximately 7 MWs of retail base-load requirements in 2016. 
Details of these generating facilities are described in the table below. 

Name and Location of Plant | Fuel Source | Namplate Capacity (MW) | OwnershipInterest | OwnedCapacity (MW)
Colstrip Unit 4, located near Colstrip in southeastern Montana | Sub-bituminous coal | 740 | 30% | 222 
Dave Gates Generating Station, located near Anaconda, Montana | Natural Gas | 150 | 100% | 150 
Spion Kop Wind, located in Judith Basin County in Montana | Wind | 40 | 100% | 40 

Renewable portfolio standards (RPS) enacted in Montana currently require that 15% of our annual electric supply portfolio be derived from eligible sources, including resources such as wind, biomass, solar, and small hydroelectric. Eligible resources used to serve our load generate renewable energy credits (RECs). Any RECs in excess of the annual requirements for a given year are carried forward for up to two years to meet future RPS needs. Our owned hydro generation assets are not eligible resources under the RPS. Given contracts under negotiation and our portfolio resources, we expect to meet the Montana RPS requirements through at least 2026. The penalty for not meeting the RPS is up to $10 per MWH for each REC short of the requirement. 
As a subset of the total RPS requirement, we were required to acquire, as of December 31, 2016, approximately 68 MW of community renewable energy projects, if cost effective. Since 2008, we have undertaken competitive solicitations to acquire this particular resource but have only contracted for 25 MW. We have filed waivers for the years 2012 through 2015, as we have not been able to contract with projects that meet the required qualifications. The MPSC granted waivers for 2012 through 2014, and the waiver request for 2015 is still pending. We expect to file a waiver request for 2016. If the requested waivers are 
 11

not granted, we may be liable for penalties. If penalties are applied, the amount of the penalty would depend on how the MPSC calculates the energy that a community renewable energy project would have produced. 
South Dakota
Our South Dakota electric utility business operates as a vertically integrated generation, transmission and distribution utility. We have the exclusive right to serve an area in South Dakota comprised of 25 counties with a combined 2010 census population of approximately 226,200. We provide retail electricity to more than 63,200 customers in 110 communities in South Dakota. In 2016, by category, residential, commercial and other sales accounted for approximately 39%, 59%, and 2%, respectively, of our South Dakota retail electric utility revenue. Peak demand was approximately 330 MWs, the average load was approximately 189 MWs, and 1.66 million MWHs were supplied during the year ended December 31, 2016. 

Our transmission and distribution network in South Dakota consists of approximately 3,550 miles of overhead and underground transmission and distribution lines as well as 124 substations. We have interconnection with the transmission facilities of Otter Tail Power Company; Montana-Dakota Utilities Co.; Xcel Energy Inc.; and WAPA. We have emergency interconnections with the transmission facilities of East River Electric Cooperative, Inc. and West Central Electric Cooperative. 

Energy Sources and Resource Planning
We have a resource plan that includes estimates of customer usage and programs to provide for the economic, reliable and timely supply of energy. We continue to update our load forecast to identify the future electric energy needs of our customers, and we evaluate additional generating capacity requirements on an ongoing basis. We use market purchases and peaking generation to provide peak supply in excess of our base-load capacity. We have an agreement with Missouri River Energy Services to supply firm capacity of 30 MW in 2017 and 35 MW in 2018. We are a member of the SPP, which is a regional transmission organization that operates an organized energy market in the Central United States. As a market participant in SPP, we buy and sell wholesale energy and reserves in both day-ahead and real-time markets through the operation of a single, consolidated SPP balancing authority. We and other SPP members submit into the SPP market both offers to sell our generation and bids to purchase power to serve our load. SPP optimizes next-day and real-time generation dispatch across the region and provides participants with greater access to economic energy. 
Our sources of energy by type during 2016 were as follows:

Generation Facilities
                        
Our electric supply portfolio consists primarily of power plants that we own jointly with unaffiliated parties. Each of the jointly owned plants is subject to a joint management structure, and we are not the operator of any of these plants. Based upon our ownership interest, we are entitled to a proportionate share of the capacity of our jointly owned plants and are responsible for a proportionate share of the operating costs. Additional resources in our supply portfolio include several wholly owned peaking units and three wind projects. The Beethoven wind project is a 80 MW nameplate facility. Actual output varies as wind generation resources are highly dependent upon weather conditions. We also purchase the output of two wind projects, one of which is a QF, under power purchase agreements. We also have several wholly owned peaking/standby generating units at locations throughout our service territory.
Details of our generating facilities are described further in the chart below. 

Name and Location of Plant | Fuel Source | Nameplate Capacity (MW) | OwnershipInterest | OwnedCapacity (MW)
Big Stone Plant, located near Big Stone City in northeastern South Dakota | Sub-bituminous coal | 475 | 23.4% | 111 
Coyote I Electric Generating Station, located near Beulah, North Dakota | Lignite coal | 427 | 10.0% | 43 
Neal Electric Generating Unit No. 4, located near Sioux City, Iowa | Sub-bituminous coal | 644 | 8.7% | 56

The fuel for our jointly owned base-load generating plants is provided through supply contracts of various lengths with several coal companies. Coyote is a mine-mouth generating facility. Neal #4 and Big Stone receive their fuel supply via rail. The average delivered cost by type of fuel burned varies between generation facilities due to differences in transportation costs and owner purchasing power for coal supply. Changes in our fuel costs are passed on to customers through the operation of the fuel adjustment clause in our South Dakota tariffs.

South Dakota has a voluntary renewable and recycled energy objective. The objective states that 10% of all electricity sold at retail within South Dakota be obtained from renewable and recycled energy sources. In 2016, approximately 26% of the South Dakota retail needs were generated from renewable resources. In 2017, we expect to continue to exceed South Dakota's voluntary objective at approximately the same level.
Since October 2015 when we joined the SPP as a transmission owning member we have continued to transfer control of qualifying South Dakota transmission assets into the SPP. To date, we have transferred control of over 330 line miles of 115 kV facilities and over 97 line miles of 69 kV facilities. All of our SPP controlled facilities reside in the Upper Missouri Zone (UMZ), which is also known as Zone 10 in the regional transmission organization. Along with us, other transmission owning members in the UMZ include Basin Electric Power Cooperative, Corn Belt Power Cooperative, Heartland Consumers Power District, Missouri River Energy Services, and WAPA. The Coyote and Big Stone power plants in which we are a joint owner, are connected directly to the MISO system, and we have ownership rights in the transmission lines from these plants to our distribution system. Marketing activities in SPP are handled for us by a third-party provider acting as our agent. Along with operating the transmission system, SPP also coordinates transmission planning for all members of the organization. 


NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS

Montana
Our regulated natural gas utility business in Montana includes production, storage, transmission and distribution. As of year-end 2016, we distributed natural gas to approximately 194,100 customers in 105 Montana communities over a system that consists of approximately 5,150 miles of underground distribution pipelines. We also serve several smaller distribution companies that provide service to approximately 32,000 customers. We transmit natural gas in Montana from production receipt points and storage facilities to distribution points and other nonaffiliated transmission systems. We transported natural gas volumes of approximately 41.6 Bcf during the year ended December 31, 2016. 

Our natural gas transmission system consists of more than 2,100 miles of pipeline, which vary in diameter from two inches to 24 inches, and serve more than 130 city gate stations. We have connections in Montana with four major, nonaffiliated transmission systems: Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline, NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd., Colorado Interstate Gas, and Spur Energy. Seven compressor sites provide more than 43,000 horsepower, capable of moving more than 335,000 dekatherms per day. In addition, we own and operate two transmission pipelines through our subsidiaries, Canadian-Montana Pipe Line Corporation and Havre Pipeline Company, LLC. 

We have municipal franchises to transport and distribute natural gas in the Montana communities we serve. The terms of the franchises vary by community. They typically have a fixed 10-year term and continue for an additional 10-year term unless and until cancelled, with 5 years notice. If a cancellation notice is received, our policy generally is to work with the community to resolve any issues and execute a new franchise. We currently have four franchises, which account for approximately 7,500 or approximately four percent of our natural gas customers, where the fixed term has expired. We continue to serve those customers while we obtain formal renewals. During the next five years, four additional municipal franchises are scheduled to reach the end of their fixed term, which account for approximately 36,000 or 19 percent of our natural gas customers. We do not anticipate termination of any of these franchises.
Natural gas is used for residential and commercial heating, and for fuel for two electric generating facilities. The demand for natural gas largely depends upon weather conditions. Our Montana retail natural gas supply requirements for the year ended December 31, 2016, were approximately 18.7 Bcf. Our Montana natural gas supply requirements for electric generation fuel for the year ended December 31, 2016, were approximately 4.5 Bcf. We have contracted with several major producers and marketers with varying contract durations to provide the anticipated supply to meet ongoing requirements. Our natural gas supply requirements are fulfilled through third-party fixed-term purchase contracts, short-term market purchases and owned production. Our portfolio approach to natural gas supply is intended to enable us to maintain a diversified supply of natural gas sufficient to meet our supply requirements. We benefit from direct access to suppliers in the major natural gas producing regions in the United States, primarily the Rockies (Colorado), Montana, and Alberta, Canada.
 14

Owned Production and Storage
Since 2010, we have acquired gas production and gathering system assets as a part of an overall strategy to provide rate stability and customer value: as we own these assets, which are regulated, our customers are protected from potential price spikes in the market. As of December 31, 2016, these owned reserves totaled approximately 60.6 Bcf and are estimated to provide approximately 4.7 Bcf in 2017, or about 23 percent of our expected annual retail natural gas load in Montana. In addition, we own and operate three working natural gas storage fields in Montana with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately 17.75 Bcf and maximum aggregate daily deliverability of approximately 195,000 dekatherms. 
South Dakota and Nebraska
We provide natural gas to approximately 88,500 customers in 60 South Dakota communities and four Nebraska communities. We have approximately 2,405 miles of underground distribution pipelines and 55 miles of transmission pipeline in South Dakota and Nebraska. In South Dakota, we also transport natural gas for nine gas-marketing firms and three large end-user accounts. In Nebraska, we transport natural gas for three gas-marketing firms and one end-user account. We delivered approximately 26.5 Bcf of third-party transportation volume on our South Dakota distribution system and approximately 3.0 Bcf of third-party transportation volume on our Nebraska distribution system during 2016. 

Our South Dakota natural gas supply requirements for the year ended December 31, 2016, were approximately 5.2 Bcf. We contract with a third party under an asset management agreement to manage transportation and storage of supply to minimize cost and price volatility to our customers. In Nebraska, our natural gas supply requirements for the year ended December 31, 2016, were approximately 3.9 Bcf. We contract with a third party under an asset management agreement that includes pipeline capacity, supply, and asset optimization activities. To supplement firm gas supplies in South Dakota and Nebraska, we contract for firm natural gas storage services to meet the heating season and peak day requirements of our customers. 

We have municipal franchises to purchase, transport and distribute natural gas in the South Dakota and Nebraska communities we serve. The maximum term permitted under Nebraska law for these franchises is 25 years while the maximum term permitted under South Dakota law is 20 years. Our policy generally is to seek renewal or extension of a franchise in the last year of its term. During the next five years, 10 of our South Dakota franchises are scheduled to reach the end of their fixed term. We do not anticipate termination of any of these franchises.

REGULATION

Base rates are the rates we are allowed to charge our customers for the cost of providing delivery service and rate-based supply services, plus a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. We have both electric and natural gas base rates. We may ask the respective regulatory commission to increase base rates from time to time. We have historically been allowed to increase base rates to recover our utility plant investment and operating costs, plus a return on our capital investment. Rate increases are normally granted based on historical data and those increases may not always keep pace with increasing costs. For more information on current regulatory matters, see Note 4 - Regulatory Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following is a summary of our rate base and authorized rates of return in each jurisdiction:


Jurisdiction and Service | Implementation Date | Authorized Rate Base (millions) (1) | Estimated Rate Base (millions) (2) | Authorized Overall Rate of Return | Authorized Return on Equity | Authorized Equity Level

(5)    For those items marked as "n/a," the respective settlement and/or order was not specific as to these terms.
MPSC Regulation 
Our Montana operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC with respect to rates, terms and conditions of service, accounting records, electric service territorial issues and other aspects of our operations, including when we issue, assume, or guarantee securities in Montana, or when we create liens on our regulated Montana properties. We have an obligation to provide service to our customers with an opportunity to earn a regulated rate of return. 
Electric and Natural Gas Supply Trackers - Rates for our Montana electric and natural gas supply are set by the MPSC. Certain supply rates are adjusted on a monthly basis for volumes and costs during each July to June 12-month tracking period. Annually, supply rates are adjusted to include any differences in the previous tracking year's actual to estimated information for recovery during the subsequent tracking year. We submit annual electric and natural gas tracker filings for the actual 12-month period ended June 30 and for the projected supply costs for the next 12-month period. The MPSC reviews such filings and makes its cost recovery determination based on whether or not our electric and natural gas energy supply procurement activities were prudent. If the MPSC subsequently determines that a procurement activity was imprudent, then it may disallow such costs. 
 16

Montana Property Tax Tracker - We file an annual property tax tracker (including other state/local taxes and fees) with the MPSC for an automatic rate adjustment, which reflects 60% of the change in property taxes. Adjusted rates are typically effective January 1st of each year.

SDPUC Regulation 

Our South Dakota operations are subject to SDPUC jurisdiction with respect to rates, terms and conditions of service, accounting records, electric service territorial issues and other aspects of our electric and natural gas operations. Our retail electric rates, approved by the SDPUC, provide several options for residential, commercial and industrial customers, including dual-fuel, interruptible, special all-electric heating, and other special rates. Our retail natural gas tariffs include gas transportation rates for transportation through our distribution systems by customers and natural gas marketers from the interstate pipelines at which our systems take delivery to the end-user. Such transporting customers nominate the amount of natural gas to be delivered daily. Usage for these customers is monitored daily by us through electronic metering equipment and balanced against respective supply agreements. 

An electric adjustment clause provides for quarterly adjustment based on differences in the delivered cost of energy, delivered cost of fuel, ad valorem taxes paid and commission-approved fuel incentives. The adjustment goes into effect upon filing, and is deemed approved within 10 days after the information filing unless the SDPUC staff requests changes during that period. A purchased gas adjustment provision in our natural gas rate schedules permits the monthly adjustment of charges to customers to reflect increases or decreases in purchased gas, gas transportation and ad valorem taxes. 

NPSC Regulation 

Our Nebraska natural gas rates and terms and conditions of service for residential and smaller commercial customers are regulated by the NPSC. High volume customers are not subject to such regulation, but can file complaints if they allege discriminatory treatment. Under the Nebraska State Natural Gas Regulation Act, a regulated natural gas utility may propose a change in rates to its regulated customers, if it files an application for a rate increase with the NPSC and with the communities in which it serves customers. The utility may negotiate with those communities for a settlement with regard to the rate change if the affected communities representing more than 50% of the affected ratepayers agree to direct negotiations, or it may proceed to have the NPSC review the filing and make a determination. Our tariffs have been accepted by the NPSC, and the NPSC has adopted certain rules governing the terms and conditions of service of regulated natural gas utilities. Our retail natural gas tariffs provide residential, general service and commercial and industrial options, as well as firm and interruptible transportation service. A purchased gas adjustment clause provides for adjustments based on changes in gas supply and interstate pipeline transportation costs.

FERC Regulation 

We are subject to FERC's jurisdiction and regulations with respect to rates for electric transmission service in interstate commerce and electricity sold at wholesale rates, hydro licensing and operations, the issuance of certain securities, incurrence of certain long-term debt, and compliance with mandatory reliability regulations, among other things. Under FERC's open access transmission policy promulgated in Order No. 888, as owners of transmission facilities, we are required to provide open access to our transmission facilities under filed tariffs at cost-based rates. In addition, we are required to comply with FERC's Standards of Conduct, as amended, governing the communication of non-public information between our transmission employees and wholesale merchant employees. 

Our Montana wholesale transmission customers, such as cooperatives, are served under our OATT, which is on file with FERC. The OATT also defines the terms, conditions and rates of our Montana transmission service, including ancillary services. As discussed above, our South Dakota transmission operations joined the SPP during 2015, and the majority of transmission service in that territory is provided under the SPP OATT. We maintain an OATT in South Dakota, however, to provide discrete transmission service to a small number of transmission customers. 

Our natural gas transportation pipelines are generally not subject to FERC's jurisdiction under the NGA, although we are subject to state regulation. We conduct limited interstate transportation in Montana and South Dakota that is subject to FERC jurisdiction, but FERC has allowed the MPSC and SDPUC to set the rates for this interstate service. We have capacity agreements in South Dakota and Nebraska with interstate pipelines that are also subject to FERC jurisdiction.
The facilities acquired in the Hydro Transaction are licensed by the FERC. In connection with the relicensing of these generating facilities, applicable law permits the FERC to issue a new license to the existing licensee or to a new licensee, and alternatively allows the U.S. government to take over the facility. If the existing licensee is not relicensed, it is compensated for 
 17

its net investment in the facility, not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable severance damages to other property affected by the lack of relicensing. 

Reliability Standards - We must comply with the standards and requirements that apply to the NERC functions for which we have registered in both the MRO for our South Dakota operations and the WECC for our Montana operations. WECC and the MRO have responsibility for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the FERC approved mandatory Reliability Standards within their respective regions. Additional reliability standards continue to be developed and will be adopted in the future. We expect that the existing reliability standards will change often as a result of modifications, guidance and clarification following industry implementation and ongoing audits and enforcement. 

SEASONALITY AND CYCLICALITY


Our electric and gas utility businesses are seasonal businesses, and weather patterns can have a material impact on operating performance. Because natural gas is used primarily for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon weather patterns throughout our market areas, and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season. Demand for electricity is often greater in the summer and winter months for cooling and heating, respectively. Accordingly, our operations have historically generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. When we experience unusually mild winters or summers in the future, these weather patterns could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

ENVIRONMENTAL

The operation of electric generating, transmission and distribution facilities, and gas gathering, transportation and distribution facilities, along with the development (involving site selection, environmental assessments, and permitting) and construction of these assets, are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental and land use laws and regulations. Our activities involve compliance with diverse laws and regulations that address emissions and impacts to the environment, including air and water, protection of natural resources and wildlife. We monitor federal, state, and local environmental initiatives to determine potential impacts on our financial results. As new laws or regulations are issued, we assess their applicability and implement the necessary modifications to our facilities or their operation to maintain ongoing compliance.
We strive to comply with all environmental regulations applicable to our operations. However, it is not possible to determine when or to what extent additional facilities or modifications of existing or planned facilities will be required as a result of changes to environmental regulations, interpretations or enforcement policies or, what effect future laws or regulations may have on our operations. The EPA is in the process of proposing and finalizing a number of environmental regulations that will directly affect the electric industry over the coming years. These initiatives cover all sources - air, water and waste. For more information on environmental regulations and contingencies and related capital expenditures, see Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
