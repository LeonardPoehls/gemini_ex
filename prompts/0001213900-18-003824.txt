ITEM 1. | DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
--------+-------------------------

 
Technical Industries & Energy, Corp. (“TIE” or the “Company”) was founded in the State of Delaware on November 29, 2006. On January 3, 2007, we entered into a Stock Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement with Technical Industries, Inc., (“TII”) a Louisiana corporation founded May 11, 1971 whereby TII became our wholly owned operating subsidiary. On September 9, 2008 we changed our name to Energy & Technology Corp. The Company’s activities are directed towards manufacturing, reclamation of essential commodities, energy, technology, oil & gas equipment and products. We plan to expand our operations and may acquire other companies with services and products which complement existing services and products and offer our latest technology exploration in order to help energy companies reach deep energy reserves that present technology cannot reach, and increase opportunities for income, growth and financing. Our business offices are located at Petroleum Towers, Suite 530 P.O. Box 52523, Lafayette, LA, 70505. Our telephone number is (337) 984-2000.
 
We are headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana with a branch office and production facilities in Houston, Texas and Abbeville Airport in Abbeville, Louisiana. We offer several services, which can be described as engineering, manufacturing, reclamation, sales, destructive, and non-destructive testing (“NDT”) and inspection services, storage, and maintenance for pipe and equipment utilized in the energy industry.
 
NDT is more fully described as the application of industry-wide and/or proprietary test methods to examine pipe and equipment utilized in the energy industry, or any object, material or system associated therewith, without impairing their future usefulness. An essential characteristic of NDT is that the examination process does not change the composition, shape, integrity or properties of the test object, thus allowing the object to be utilized for the purpose for which it was manufactured. The end result is less time involved in testing, lower costs, and less waste of materials than other forms of pipe inspection that require that the test object be destroyed.
 
Through our staff of industrial, electrical and computer engineers, we offer engineering services to assist our customers in the design, improvement, installation, and/or integration of NDT components and systems.  The services, which vary according to the needs of the customer, focus on design, layout, testing, and troubleshooting of NDT systems hardware and software.
 
We also manufacture our own proprietary ultrasonic NDT electronic equipment systems, which perform the NDT services including ultrasonic inspection, electromagnetic inspection, and others. The layout and design of the systems’ physical components are produced and tested by our engineers. Once the design has passed testing, the individual components are built into the design. Some of the components, such as the circuit boards, may be assembled by a third party before being incorporated into the design. Last, the final assembly is integrated with proprietary inspection software developed by our programmers.
 
Another component of our business consists of selling pipe and equipment used in exploration, drilling, and production of oil and gas.  The manufactured pipe and equipment is supplied to us by various steel mills and suppliers, such as: U.S.S. Steel, SB Int’l, and Premier Pipe: in finished or unfinished form for us to process. Before the pipe and equipment is offered to our customers for sale, it must undergo further processing, such as blasting, threading, coating, and non-destructive testing inspection before being turned into a final product.  We sell oilfield pipe and equipment that has passed inspection and meets or exceeds API (American Petroleum Institute) and/or customer specifications.
 
Lastly, we provide manufacturing and reclamation including threading, machining of pipe and equipment, and ultrasonic pipe inspection technology. Services include full-length electromagnetic inspection for pipe and equipment utilized in the energy industry, and full length ultrasonic inspection systems for new and used pipe including drill stem, tubing, casing, and line pipe. We offer several different types of electromagnetic and ultrasonic inspection processes, each of which is tailored to the inspection of a particular pipe characteristic, such as size, length, wall thickness, ovality, or detection of a particular pipe defect. The type of process is determined by the customer according to their particular needs.
 
All of the pipe and equipment that enters our facilities are carefully documented and incorporated into our proprietary inventory tracking system, which is accessible to customers on the World Wide Web. Through this system, the customer is able to obtain real-time storage and inspection information on his pipe and equipment that is located at our facilities.
 
We operate year-round, 24 hours a day, seven days a week when needed, and the number of people employed averages 50.
 
Today, we continue to serve the energy industry by manufacturing and maintaining proprietary systems that detect and collect all available defects and wall thickness and outside diameter/ovality readings and store them in their proper position on the pipe, produce a three-dimensional image of the pipe, and allow the engineer to simulate burst, collapse, and pull apart the pipe on the computer prior to drilling. This helps energy companies reach reserves that otherwise cannot be reached with present technology. As a result of this advanced technology, the American Petroleum Institute (API) appointed Mr. George M. Sfeir, to serve on their 2008 committee for non-contact inspection. Technical Industries, Inc. developed US Patent No. 7,263,887 and international patent pending inspection technology needed in order to reach deep energy reserves present technology cannot reach. The U.S. patent is current until 2039. We provide basic NDT services as well as highly technical services requiring our patented technology for major companies’ critical projects.

Additional services include full-length electromagnetic inspection for oil-field pipe and equipment and full length ultrasonic inspection systems for new and used tubing, casing and line-pipe, wet or dry Magnetic Particle Inspection ("MPI"); Dye Penetrant Testing ("PT"), or Ultrasonic Testing of the End Areas ("UT SEA") of plain end and threaded connections, including drill collars and drilling rig inspection; mill systems and mill surveillance; testing and consulting services. Today we continue to serve the energy industry niche by manufacturing and maintaining proprietary systems that are capable of detecting defects through the use of our patented technology.
