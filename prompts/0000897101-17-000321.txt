Market Overview:
 
IntriCon serves the body-worn device market by designing, developing, engineering, manufacturing and distributing micro-miniature products, microelectronics, micro-mechanical assemblies, complete assemblies and software solutions, primarily for the emerging value based hearing healthcare market, the hearing health market, the medical bio-telemetry market and the professional audio communication market. Revenue from these markets is reported on the respective lines in the discussion of our results of operations in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 20 “Revenue by Market” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included herein.
Value Based Hearing Healthcare Market
 
The Company believes the value based hearing healthcare (VBHH) market offers significant growth opportunities. In the United States alone, there are approximately 37.5 million adults that report some degree of hearing loss. In adults the most common cause of hearing loss is aging and noise. In fact, by the age of 65 years old, one out of three people have hearing loss. The hearing impaired population is expected to grow significantly over the next decade due to an aging population and more frequent exposure to loud sounds that can cause noise-induced hearing loss. It is estimated that hearing aids can help more than 90 percent of people with hearing loss, however the current market penetration into the U.S. hearing impaired population is approximately 20 percent, a percentage that has remained essentially unchanged for the last four decades. The primary deterrents to greater penetration are cost and access. The average cost of a hearing aid in the US market today is over $2,400 per device, more than double the cost from twelve years ago. Approximately 70 percent of the hearing impaired have hearing loss in both ears (referred to as a binaural loss), driving the total cost to almost $5,000 on average for a set of hearing aids.
 
We believe a perfect vortex of factors has come together over the last few years to enable the emergence of a market disruptive high-quality, low cost distribution model, including, continued consolidation of retail (causing escalating hearing aid prices), consumer outcry, consumer education, advancements in technology (such as behind-the-ear devices, advanced digital signal processing, low-power wireless, and self-fitting software) as well as regulatory actions and pronouncements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine.
 
Today in the US market, the conventional channel pushes all hearing impaired through the same bloated, costly channel. However, a very large portion of the hearing-impaired market – mostly notably those with mild to moderate losses – could be properly severed with the proper combination of high quality, outcome based devices, advanced fitting software and consumer services/care best practices – all at much lower cost. We believe fundamental change is needed and are excited about the opportunity that we created through thoughtful hard work and planning: a chance to deliver superior outcomes-based affordable hearing healthcare, by combining state-of-the-art devices and software technology, along with best practices customer service and at a much lower cost directly to consumers across the country, many of whom have not been able to afford care previously.

In early January 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) weighed in on low hearing aid penetration rates with an announcement that highlighted statistics from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. They found that 37.5 million U.S. adults aged 18 and older report some form of hearing loss. However, only 30 percent of adults over 70, and 16 percent of those aged 20 to 69, who could benefit from wearing hearing aids, have ever used them. Based on these statistics, the FDA has reopened the public comment period on draft guidance related to the agency’s premarket requirements for hearing aids and personal sound amplifiers (PSAPs). In April 2016, the FDA hosted a public workshop to gather stakeholder and public input on draft guidance related to the agency’s premarket requirements for hearing aids and PSAPs. The FDA’s intent is to consider ways in which regulation can support further device penetration into the hearing market. In December 2016, the FDA announced important steps to better support consumer access to hearing aids. The agency issued a guidance document explaining that it does not intend to enforce the requirement that individuals age 18 and older receive a medical evaluation or sign a waiver prior to purchasing most hearing aids, effective immediately. It also announced its commitment to consider creating a category of over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids that could deliver new, innovative and lower-cost products to millions of consumers. Further guidance is expected in 2017.
 
The Company is in the final stages of commercializing its PhysioLink™ 2 wireless technology, which will be incorporated into product platforms serving the traditional and value based hearing healthcare markets. This technology is an integrated platform that incorporates IntriCon’s Audion™ 8 amplifier and Bluetooth® low energy, enabling wireless connectivity from any Bluetooth® enabled device over distances up to five meters.
 
We are also currently developing our third generation PhysioLink™ technology, leveraging industry leading wireless IC technology to enable concurrent audio streaming and data transmission over Bluetooth® low energy. This technology will be incorporated into product platforms serving traditional and value hearing healthcare markets, providing end users with an unprecedented experience through breakthrough audio and wireless performance.
 
In October of 2016, we purchased 20 percent of Hearing Help Express, Inc., a direct-to-consumer mail order hearing aid provider. Hearing Help Express is a key next step in our value-based hearing healthcare strategy. Over the last decade, we have invested in the technology and low-cost manufacturing to design and build superior devices and fitting solutions, to address what we estimate to be a $1 billion annually value based hearing healthcare market. With this acquisition, we now have the channel infrastructure to directly reach consumers and—importantly for millions—the ability to offer high-quality hearing healthcare at a fraction of the cost. Through our other VBHH initiatives and tests, we have formed alliances with other key partners, which have given us experience and vital insight as we move aggressively into a more consumer-facing role. Hearing Help Express provides an efficient, traditional direct-to-consumer channel to reach consumers who likely do not have insurance that will cover hearing devices. This is a channel that we can build on and expand via technology—and one that is complementary with many of our existing relationships.
 
In other VBHH channels, the Company entered into a manufacturing agreement with hi HealthInnovations, a UnitedHealth Group company, to become their supplier of hearing aids. At the beginning of 2012, hi HealthInnovations launched a suite of high-tech, lower-cost hearing devices for their Medicare and Part D participants and later in the year announced they were increasing this offering to the over 26 million people enrolled in their employer-sponsored and individual health benefit plans. In 2012, they expanded their offering to include a hearing aid discount program for health plans. This program is available nationwide to all health insurers, including employer-sponsored, individual and Medicare plans. The insurance model has been successfully demonstrated internationally, where several countries providing a full insurance program are serving 40 to 70 percent of the hearing impaired population. Further, research in the U.S. has shown a fully insured model will encourage an individual to seek treatment at an earlier stage of hearing loss, greatly increasing the market size and penetration. The Company also has various international VHBB initiatives. On November 3, 2015, the Company acquired the assets of PC Werth through its IntriCon UK subsidiary to gain direct access to the NHS and to have greater control over its efforts to accelerate new market penetration into the United Kingdom. IntriCon UK has been appointed as one of the main suppliers to the NHS Supply Chain’s National Framework. The NHS is widely seen as the most efficient hearing aid delivery system in the world, supplying an estimated 1.4 million hearing aids annually. We believe IntriCon is well positioned to serve their needs, and we are developing new technologies to further enhance delivery efficiencies and product standards in the future.
 
We also believe there are niches in the conventional hearing health channel that will embrace our VBHH proposition in the United States and Europe. High costs of conventional devices and retail consolidation have constrained the growth potential of the independent audiologist and dispenser. We believe our software and product offering can provide independent audiologists and dispensers the ability to compete with larger retailers, such as Costco, and manufacturer owned retail distributors. In the third quarter of 2015, we announced a joint venture with The Academy of Doctors of Audiology (ADA) to provide hearing instruments and educational resources to audiologists and their patients. The joint venture operates as a limited liability company under the name “earVenture LLC”. EarVenture was officially launched in November 2015 at the ADA conference. To date, more than 400 of the 1,200 ADA members have registered to join the earVenture program and we have delivered initial units. In 2016, earVenture began rolling-out a comprehensive marketing and sales plan to convert those registered members to consistent customers, as well as solicit non-registered ADA members to join the program. While we do not view earVenture, near term, as a meaningful contributor to sales, it continues to provide valuable industry insights and has the potential for future value by connecting it to our emerging DTC channel.

Medical Bio-Telemetry
 
In the medical bio-telemetry market, the Company is focused on sales of bio-telemetry devices for life-critical diagnostic monitoring. Using our nanoDSP and BodyNet™ technology platforms, the Company manufactures microelectronics, micro-mechanical assemblies, high-precision injection-molded plastic components and complete bio-telemetry devices for emerging and leading medical device manufacturers. The medical industry is faced with pressures to reduce the cost of healthcare. Driven by core technologies, such as the IntriCon Physiolink™ that wirelessly connects patients and care givers in non-traditional ways, IntriCon helps shift the point of care from expensive traditional settings, such as hospitals, to less expensive non-traditional settings like the home. IntriCon currently serves this market by offering medical manufacturers the capabilities to design, develop, manufacture and distribute medical devices that are easier to use, are more miniature, use less power, and are lighter. Increasingly, the medical industry is looking for wireless, low-power capabilities in their devices.
 
IntriCon currently has a strong presence in the diabetes and other bio-telemetry markets. For diabetes, IntriCon has partnered with Medtronic to manufacture their wireless continuous glucose monitors (CGM), sensors, and accessories associated with Medtronic’s CGM system, including the MiniMed Connect, which links the MiniMed pump and CGM to certain smart devices providing users with a discrete and real-time view of their blood sugar information. Our Medtronic business posted record revenue in 2015, led by the MiniLink REAL-Time Transmitter and related accessories sales, which are incorporated in Medtronic’s MiniMed 530G insulin pump and CGM system. In August 2016, the FDA approved the MiniMed 630G system which will replace the 530G system. In addition to the MiniMed 630G system, IntriCon is also designed into the MiniMed 670G system which was approved by the FDA in September 2016, and is scheduled to be launched in the spring of 2017. The MiniMed 670G is the world’s first hybrid closed loop insulin delivery system and we are excited to be designed into and supporting such a revolutionary diabetes management system. Looking ahead, we believe there are opportunities to expand our diabetes product offering with Medtronic, as well as move into new markets outside of the diabetes market.
 
IntriCon has a suite of medical coils and micro coils that it offers to various original equipment manufacturing (OEM) customers. These products are currently used in pacemaker programming and interventional catheter positioning applications.
 
IntriCon manufactures bubble sensors and flow restrictors that monitor and control the flow of fluid in an intravenous infusion system as well as a family of safety needle products for an OEM customer that utilizes IntriCon’s insert and straight molding capabilities. These products are assembled using full automation, including built-in quality checks within the production lines.
 
Lastly, IntriCon is targeting other emerging biotelemetry and home care markets that could benefit from its capabilities to develop devices that are more technologically advanced, smaller and lightweight. To do so, IntriCon is leveraging its resources in sales and marketing and research and development to expand its reach to other large medical device and health care companies.
 
Professional Audio Communications
 
IntriCon entered the high-quality audio communication device market in 2001, and now has a line of miniature, professional audio headset products used by customers focusing on emergency response needs. The line includes several communication devices that are extremely portable and perform well in noisy or hazardous environments. These products are well suited for applications in the fire, law enforcement, safety, aviation and military markets. In addition, the Company has a line of miniature ear- and head-worn devices used by performers and support staff in the music and stage performance markets. We believe performance in difficult listening environments and wireless operations will continue to improve as these products increasingly include our proprietary nanoDSP, wireless nanoLink and PhysioLink technologies.
 
For information concerning our net sales, net income and assets, see the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Core Technologies Overview: 
 
Our core technologies expertise is focused on three main markets: medical bio-telemetry, value based hearing healthcare and professional audio communications. Over the past several years, the Company has increased investments in the continued development of four critical core technologies: Ultra-Low-Power (ULP) Digital Signal Processing (DSP), ULP Wireless, Microminiaturization, and Miniature Transducers. These four core technologies serve as the foundation of current and future product platform development, designed to meet the rising demand for smaller, portable, more advanced devices and the need for greater efficiencies in the delivery models. The continued advancements in this area have allowed the Company to further enhance the mobility and effectiveness of miniature body-worn devices.
ULP DSP
 DSP converts real-world analog signals into a digital format. Through our nanoDSP™ technology, IntriCon offers an extensive range of ULP DSP amplifiers for hearing, medical and professional audio applications. Our proprietary nanoDSP incorporates advanced ultra-miniature hardware with sophisticated signal processing algorithms to produce devices that are smaller and more effective.

The Company further expanded its DSP portfolio including improvements to its Reliant CLEAR™ feedback canceller, offering increased added stable gain and faster reaction time. Additionally, the DSP technologies are utilized in the Audion8™, our eight-channel hearing aid amplifier, and the Audion16™, our wide dynamic range compression sixteen-channel hearing aid amplifier announced in April 2016. The amplifiers are feature-rich and are designed to fit a wide array of applications. In addition to multiple compression channels, the amplifiers have a complete set of proven adaptive features which greatly improve the user experience.
 
ULP Wireless
 Wireless connectivity is fast becoming a required technology, and wireless capabilities are especially critical in new body-worn devices. IntriCon’s BodyNet™ ULP technology, including the nanoLink™ and PhysioLink™ wireless systems, offers solutions for transmitting the body’s activities to caregivers, and wireless audio links for professional communications and surveillance products include diabetes monitoring, and audio streaming for hearing devices.
 
IntriCon is in the final stages of commercializing its PhysioLink2 and Physiolink3 wireless technology, which will be incorporated into product platforms serving the medical, hearing health and professional audio communication markets. This system is based on 2.4GHz proprietary digital radio protocol in the industrial-scientific-medical (ISM) frequency band and enables audio and data streaming and command and control to ear-worn and body-worn applications over distances of up to five meters. The Physiolink2 technology can be used to increase productivity in the emerging VBHH channels through in office wireless programming, remote cloud based fitting and consumer directed self-fitting of hearing aids. This will provide both greater access and lower costs for patients. In addition, remote control functions will improve the patient experience while using the device especially for those with diminished dexterity. The Physiolink3 technology builds on the Physiolink2 capabilities by adding wireless streaming at much lower power levels than any technology currently on the market. This will allow for accessories to enhance the user experience in noisy environments by allowing audio streaming directly to the hearing aid.
 
Microminiaturization
 IntriCon excels at miniaturizing body-worn devices. We began honing our microminiaturization skills over 30 years ago, supplying components to the hearing health industry. Our core miniaturization technology allows us to make devices for our markets that are one cubic inch and smaller. We also are specialists in devices that run on very low power, as evidenced by our ULP wireless and DSP. Less power means a smaller battery, which enables us to reduce size even further, and develop devices that fit into the palm of one’s hand.
Miniature Transducers
 IntriCon’s advanced transducer technology has been pushing the limits of size and performance for over a decade. Included in our transducer line are our miniature medical coils and micro coils used in pacemaker programming and interventional catheter positioning applications. We believe with the increase of greater interventional care that our coil technology harbors significant value.
Marketing and Competition:
 IntriCon intends to focus more capital and resources in marketing and sales to expand its reach into the emerging value based hearing healthcare market and large medical device and healthcare companies in the medical bio-telemetry market outlined above. The Company believes this will allow us to advance our technology portfolio, advance new product platforms, strengthen customer relationships and expand our market knowledge.
 
Currently, IntriCon sells its hearing device products directly to domestic hearing instrument manufacturers, and distributors and partnerships through an internal sales force. Sales of medical and professional audio communications products are also made primarily through an internal sales force. As a result of the investment in Hearing Help Express, the Company has begun marketing and selling hearing aid devices directly to consumers through direct mail advertising and a call center.
 
Internationally, sales representatives employed by IntriCon GmbH (“GmbH”), a wholly owned German subsidiary, solicit sales from European hearing instrument, medical device and professional audio communications manufacturers and suppliers.
 
In recent years, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of the Company’s sales. In 2016, one customer in our medical market accounted for approximately 40 percent of the Company’s net sales. During 2016, the top five customers accounted for approximately $39,972, or 59 percent, of the Company’s net sales. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of net sales and long-lived assets by geographic area.
 
IntriCon believes that it is the largest supplier worldwide of micro-miniature electromechanical components to hearing instrument manufacturers and that its full product line, automated manufacturing process and low cost manufacturing capabilities in Asia, allow it to compete effectively with other manufacturers within this market. In the market of hybrid amplifiers and molded plastic faceplates, hearing instrument manufacturers produce a substantial portion of their internal needs for these components.


IntriCon markets its high performance microphone products to the radio communication and professional audio industries and has several larger competitors who have greater financial resources. IntriCon holds a small market share in the global market for microphone capsules and other related products.

Employees. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a total of 644 full time equivalent employees, of whom 50 are executive and administrative personnel, 21 are sales personnel, 29 are engineering personnel and 544 are operations personnel. The Company considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a union.
 
As a supplier of consumer and medical products and parts, IntriCon is subject to claims for personal injuries allegedly caused by its products. The Company maintains what it believes to be adequate insurance coverage.
 
Research and Development. IntriCon conducts research and development activities primarily to improve its existing products and proprietary technology. The Company is committed to investing in the research and development of proprietary technologies, such as the ULP nanoDSP and ULP wireless technologies. The Company believes the continued development of key proprietary technologies will be the catalyst for long-term revenues and margin growth. Research and development expenditures were $4,688, $4,279, and $4,291 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These amounts are net of customer and grant reimbursed research and development.
 
IntriCon owns a number of United States patents which cover a number of product designs and processes. Although the Company believes that these patents collectively add value to the Company, the costs associated with the submission of patent applications are expensed as incurred given the uncertainty of the patents providing future economic benefit to the Company.
 
Regulation. A large portion of our business operates in a marketplace subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and by comparable agencies in foreign countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates the design control, development, manufacturing, labeling, record keeping, and surveillance procedures for medical devices.
United States Food and Drug Administration 
 FDA regulations classify medical devices based on perceived risk to public health as either Class I, II or III devices. Class I devices are subject to general controls, Class II devices are subject to special controls and Class III devices are subject to pre-market approval (“PMA”) requirements. While most Class I devices are exempt from pre-market submission, it is necessary for most Class II devices to be cleared by a 510(k) pre-market notification prior to marketing. 510(k) establishes that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device which was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 or which itself has been found to be substantially equivalent, through the 510(k) process, after May 28, 1976. It is “substantially equivalent” if it has the same intended use and the same technological characteristics as the predicate. The 510(k) pre-market notification must be supported by data establishing the claim of substantial equivalence to the satisfaction of the FDA. The process of obtaining a 510(k) clearance typically can take several months to a year or longer. If the product is notably new or different and substantial equivalence cannot be established, the FDA will require the manufacturer to submit a PMA application for a Class III device that must be reviewed and approved by the FDA prior to sale and marketing of the device in the United States. The process of obtaining PMA approval can be expensive, uncertain, lengthy and frequently requires anywhere from one to several years from the date of FDA submission, if approval is obtained at all. The FDA controls the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed and strictly prohibits the marketing of medical devices for unapproved uses. The FDA can withdraw products from the market for failure to comply with laws or the occurrence of safety risks.
 
All of our current hearing aid devices are air conduction devices and, as such, are Class I medical devices, exempt from the 510(k) submission process. They are typically marketed to FDA approved manufacturers with IntriCon assisting in the design, development and production. Our manufacturing operations are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, whose primary purpose is to audit the Company’s compliance with the Quality System Regulations published by the FDA and other applicable government standards. Strict regulatory action may be initiated in response to audit deficiencies or to product performance problems. We believe that our manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the requirements of the FDA regulations. Our most recent FDA audit was conducted in January of 2017 and no observations were noted by the FDA.
 
International Regulation 
 International regulatory bodies have established varying regulations governing product standards, packaging and labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax. Many of these regulations are similar to those of the FDA. We believe we are in compliance with the regulatory requirements in the foreign countries in which our medical devices are marketed.
 
The registration system for our medical devices in the EU requires that our quality system conforms to international quality standards and that our medical devices conform to “essential requirements” set forth by the Medical Device Directive (“MDD”). The MDD is undergoing changes with new regulations being reviewed and expected to be approved soon. These new regulations will be referred to as the Medical Device Requirements (MDR) and we will be prepared to be in compliance. Manufacturing facilities and processes under which our hearing aids are produced are inspected and audited by our International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) registrar British Standards Institute (“BSI”). Our authorized representative, CE Partner 4U, maintains our technical file and registers our products with competent authorities in all EU member states. Manufacturing facilities and processes under which all of our other medical devices are produced are inspected and audited annually by BSI. These audits verify our compliance with the essential requirements of the MDD. These certifying bodies verify that our quality system conforms to the international quality standard ISO 13485:2003 and that our products conform to the “essential requirements” and “supplementary requirements” set forth by the MDD for the class of medical devices we produce. These certifying bodies also certify our conformity with both the quality standards and the MDD requirements, entitling us to place the “CE” mark on all of our hearing aids. Our hearing aid devices typically bear the CE mark of our customers who assume regulatory responsibilities for those devices. In 2014, IntriCon obtained “CE” certification for our own hearing aid devices and we are supplying these devices into the European market.

Third Party Reimbursement 
The availability and level of reimbursement from third-party payers for procedures utilizing our products is significant to our business. Our products are purchased primarily by OEM customers who sell into clinics, hospitals and other end-users, who in turn bill various third party payers for the services provided to the patients. These payers, which include Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurance plans and managed care organizations, reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures utilizing our products.
 
In response to the national focus on rising health care costs, a number of changes to reduce costs have been proposed or have begun to emerge. There have been, and may continue to be, proposals by legislators, regulators and third party payers to curb these costs. The development or increased use of more cost effective treatments for diseases could cause such payers to decrease or deny reimbursement for surgeries or devices to favor alternatives that do not utilize our products. A significant number of Americans enroll in some form of managed care plan. Higher managed care utilization typically drives down the payments for health care procedures, which in turn places pressure on medical supply prices. This causes hospitals to implement tighter vendor selection and certification processes, by reducing the number of vendors used, purchasing more products from fewer vendors and trading discounts on price for guaranteed higher volumes to vendors. Hospitals have also sought to control and reduce costs over the last decade by joining group purchasing organizations or purchasing alliances. We cannot predict what continuing or future impact these practices, the existing or proposed legislation, or such third-party payer measures within a constantly changing healthcare landscape may have on our future business, financial condition or results of operations.
