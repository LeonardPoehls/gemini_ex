ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview 
 
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on September 14, 2011. Our original business plan was to sell high end vinyl car wraps though the internet to garages and car accessories shops on-line and to eventually sell to the retail consumer, specific car wraps for customized to different cars and models.
 
Our principal business address is 633 W. 5th Street, 26th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90071. Our headquarters are located in Buffalo, New York. We have established a fiscal year end of December 31.
 
On September 3, 2013, our board of directors and a majority of our shareholders approved a change of name of our company from Secure It Corp. to Black Stallion Oil and Gas, Inc.
 
A Certificate of Amendment to effect the change of name was filed and became effective with the Delaware Secretary of State on September 12, 2013.
 
In addition to the name change, our board of directors and a majority of our shareholders approved a 60 new for 1 old forward split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Consequently, our issued and outstanding common stock increased from 731,200 to 43,872,000 shares, all with a par value of $0.0001.
 
These amendments were approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The forward split and name change became effective on the OTC Markets at the opening of trading on September 18, 2013. Our trading symbol is “BLKG”. Our CUSIP number is 09225H 102.
 
In connection with a change of management, our company changed our business plan to that of exploration and development of oil and gas properties.
 
Our company’s new focus is to engage in oil and gas exploration, acquire and develop oil and gas properties, and sell oil and gas produced by these efforts.
 
We plan to locate and lease existing wells for reactivation for the production of oil and gas that we will then sell, through an operator, to oil and gas brokers and gatherers. The gas sometimes may be sold directly to public utility companies.
 
During the year ending 2015, our company consolidated a 100% working interest in 12,233.93 acres in oil and gas leases in Teton County, Montana. It also engaged an independent geological firm to identify the most prospective zones and recommendations for additional detailed analysis for these leases.

Competition
 
We are engaged in the acquisition and exploration of oil and gas properties. We compete with other companies for both the acquisition of prospective properties and the financing necessary to develop such properties.
 
We conduct our business in an environment that is highly competitive and unpredictable. In seeking out prospective properties, we have encountered intense competition in all aspects of our proposed business as we compete directly with other development stage companies as well as established international companies. Many of our competitors are national or international companies with far greater resources, capital and access to information than us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on the acquisition of prospective properties and on the exploration and development of such properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the exploration and exploitation of oil and gas properties. This competition could result in our competitors having resource properties of greater quality and attracting prospective investors to finance the development of such properties on more favorable terms. As a result of this competition, we may become involved in an acquisition with more risk or obtain financing on less favorable terms.

Compliance with Government Regulation
 
Oil and gas operations are subject to various national, state and local governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling and abandonment bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas. The production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of oil and gas, by-products thereof, and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations are also subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating primarily to the protection of human health and the environment. To date, expenditures related to complying with these laws, and for remediation of existing environmental contamination, have not been significant in relation to the results of operations of our company. The requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations.
Subsidiaries
 
We do not have any subsidiaries.
 
Bankruptcy or Similar Proceedings
 
We have not been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.
 
Research and Development Costs During the Last Two Years
 
We have expended $7,000 in research and development costs related to website creation and development during the last two fiscal years.
