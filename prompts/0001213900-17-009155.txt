Item 1. Business
----------------

 
Praco Corporation (the “Company”), a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on December 15, 2009 as Hunt for Travel, Inc. to design and market travel excursions featuring entertainment, adventure, intellectual stimulation and access to experts on topics related to the destinations they visit. The Company is now a “shell company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, as amended, as we have no operations. The Company no longer operates in the travel industry sector.
 
Our current intention is to sell the Company to another operational entity.
 
On April 19, 2017, the Company, entered into a Share Exchange Agreement, (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), by and among the Company, Arista, and the holders of common stock of Arista (the “Arista Shareholders”). The closing of the Share Exchange (the “Closing”) was to take place sixty days after the execution of this Agreement, conditioned upon the completion of due diligence by the Parties and is currently scheduled to take place on September 15, 2017 conditioned upon the completion of due diligence by the Parties.
 
On July 18, 2017, the Parties entered into the First Addendum to the Share Exchange Agreement, pursuant to which the Closing date for the transaction is scheduled for September 15, 2017. In addition, Arista has agreed to provide the Company with a $15,000 non-refundable deposit, and has the right to extend the closing date in intervals of thirty (30) days, and shall be required to deposit an additional non-refundable deposit of $10,000 per each requested extension interval.
 
Prior to Closing, Praco will restructure its equity ownership via a reverse stock split at a ratio of 13.2 to 1 in order to reduce the amount of common shares outstanding to 521,000 as set forth in the Share Exchange Agreement.
 
Under the terms and conditions of the Share Exchange Agreement, at Closing, the Company will exchange at a rate of two shares of Praco common stock for one common share of Arista common stock. This requires the issuance of an additional 2,084,000 shares of common stock, which would make Arista an 80% shareholder of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Share Exchange Agreement. After the Closing, current Praco Shareholders will own 20% of the common shares outstanding.
 
Also, at Closing, the Praco Shareholders shall be issued warrants for 240,417 common shares on a pro rata basis exercisable at $2.00 per share and subject to the same terms and conditions as the warrants currently held by the Arista warrant holders except that a cashless exercise shall not be permitted. In addition, at Closing, Praco will offer to exchange each outstanding Arista warrant for new warrants issued by Praco entitling the holder to purchase an equal number of Praco shares and subject to the same terms and conditions as the Arista warrants except that a cashless exercise will not be permitted. Also, at Closing, Praco will offer to exchange each outstanding Arista convertible note into a convertible note issued by Praco convertible in to an equal amount of Praco shares, subject to the same terms and conditions as the convertible notes currently held by Arista convertible noteholders.
 
All Arista common share amounts and Praco common share amounts shall be adjusted accordingly if prior to Closing, any Arista noteholder or warrantholder converts or exercises their respective securities and agrees to exchange such Arista shares for Praco shares so as to allow Arista Shareholders to own 80% and Praco Shareholders to own 20% of the issued and outstanding shares on a non-diluted basis at Closing. Furthermore, at Closing, Arista will pay Praco $75,000 to be used to pay outstanding liabilities of Praco.
