 Item 1.  Business
 Our Company
 Aratana Therapeutics, Inc. is a pet therapeutics company focused on licensing, developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics for dogs and cats. We operate in one business segment, which according to 2014 statistics sits at the intersection of the more than $60 billion annual United States pet market and the more than $29 billion annual worldwide animal health market. Our current portfolio includes multiple therapeutics and therapeutic candidates in development consisting of both small molecule pharmaceuticals and biologics. We intend for our portfolio to capture opportunities in unmet or underserved medical conditions in dogs and cats. 
 We were incorporated on December 1, 2010 under the laws of the State of Delaware. In October 2013, we acquired Vet Therapeutics, Inc. (“Vet Therapeutics”) and in January 2014, we acquired Okapi Sciences NV (“Okapi Sciences”, which was renamed Aratana Therapeutics NV and is referred to as “Aratana NV” for all post-acquisition references). In addition to these acquisitions, we have completed several licensing transactions to further build our pipeline. The address of our principal executive offices is 11400 Tomahawk Creek Parkway, Suite 340, Leawood, Kansas 66211. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Aratana,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (“2016 Annual Report”) refer to Aratana Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.
 We have three United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved therapeutics: GALLIPRANT® (grapiprant tablets) for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs, which is commercially available; ENTYCE® (capromorelin oral solution) for appetite stimulation in dogs, which is anticipated to be commercially available by late-2017; and NOCITA® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) as a local post-operative analgesia for cranial cruciate ligament surgery in dogs, which is commercially available. BLONTRESS® and TACTRESS® are our two canine-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) therapies that are fully licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) to aid in the treatment of dogs with B-cell and T-cell lymphoma, respectively. Our pipeline has multiple therapeutic candidates in development for the potential treatment of pain, viral diseases, allergy and cancer for dogs and cats.
 Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to in-license proprietary technology from human pharmaceutical companies, academia or animal health companies that is applicable to dogs and cats with the intention to develop innovative pet therapeutics to solve unmet or underserved medical needs in companion pets. We seek to identify human therapeutic candidates that have demonstrated proof of safety in the target species, proof

of efficacy in at least two mammalian species and a well-defined manufacturing process for the active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”). We also seek to identify therapeutics already in development or being made commercially available for pets in an effort to license or acquire these products. To date, we have in-licensed and are further developing pharmaceutical compounds from Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Pacira”), RaQualia Pharma Inc. (“RaQualia”), Advaxis, Inc. (“Advaxis”), VetStem BioPharma, Inc. (“VetStem”) and Atopix Therapeutics Ltd. (“Atopix”) (acquired by Chiesi Farmaceutici Spa in November 2016). 
 In addition, the Company entered into a collaboration, license, development and commercialization agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) and co-promotion agreement (the “Co-Promotion Agreement”, and together with the Collaboration Agreement, the “Elanco Agreements”) with Elanco Animal Health, Inc., a division of Eli Lilly & Co. and a leading animal health company with an established commercial presence in geographies outside the United States (“Elanco”), in April 2016, granting Elanco exclusive rights globally outside the United States to develop, manufacture, market and commercialize our products based on licensed grapiprant rights and technology, including GALLIPRANT (collectively, “Grapiprant Products”), and co-promotion rights in the United States with regards to such products.
 Our goal is to pioneer the pet therapeutics market by being a fully integrated company that develops and commercializes therapeutics for unmet or underserved medical needs in pets. We plan to accomplish this by:

--+---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | • | Assembling a management team with established experience in human pharmaceutical and animal health industries. In order to successfully execute our plan, we have assembled an experienced management team consisting of veterinarians, physicians, scientists and other professionals. The members of our senior management team have more than 100 years of combined experience in animal health and human pharmaceutical industries, as well as a strong track record of successfully developing and commercializing therapeutics for dogs and cats.
﻿ | | 
﻿ | | 
﻿ | | 
 | • | Advancing our therapeutic candidates to achieve regulatory approval or licensure. We received three FDA approvals of our lead therapeutic candidates in 2016 and maintain a portfolio of therapeutic candidates, including small molecule pharmaceuticals and biologics. These therapeutic candidates are in various stages of development for the treatment of cats or dogs, or both. In 2017, we anticipate a USDA conditional licensure for AT-014, our canine osteosarcoma vaccine.

 | • | Using a direct sales organization, distributors, co-promotion, corporate sales and/or eCommerce to make our therapeutics commercially available in the United States. We have hired approximately two dozen therapeutic specialists and a sales leadership team. These new additions along with our marketing, sales operations and veterinary services teams round out our commercial organization. We have extended their reach through strategic distributor relationships. We have an agreement with Elanco to co-promote Grapiprant Products and continue to pursue other corporate sales agreements. Veterinarians typically sell the therapeutics to pet owners or administer in-clinic at a mark-up. Our sales channels align with a veterinarian’s goal of improving the health and quality of life of pets, as well as the ability to generate revenue from sales. We believe veterinarians are motivated to prescribe innovative therapeutics that are safe, effective and validated by robust clinical data and regulatory approval. In 2017, we plan on continuing to directly market and sell our FDA-approved therapeutics to veterinarians, including in collaboration with Elanco for GALLIPRANT.

 | • | Building a global presence. We have licensed the rights to certain of our therapeutics in geographies outside the United States. We intend to seek regulatory approval for our pet therapeutics in Europe and potentially other countries. In April 2016, we announced the global Collaboration Agreement with Elanco. In the current climate, we believe there continues to be a desire from large animal health companies to collaborate on the commercialization of innovative pet therapeutics in countries outside the United States.

 | • | Continuing to grow our therapeutic pipeline by in-licensing additional therapeutic candidates. We believe the pet therapeutics market is significantly underserved and have identified more than 20 therapeutic areas that overlap with areas of human pharmaceutical development. Pursuant to our corporate strategy, we seek to identify these candidates and when appropriate, to seek exclusive, worldwide rights to these compounds in animal health. Each of our current candidates is covered by patents and/or other intellectual property that provide for a multi-year period of market exclusivity. Additionally, we intend to seek opportunities to collaborate with companies where we can provide commercialization for their approved or close-to-approved pet therapeutics.

  Research and Development
 Our drug development programs focus on the development of novel compounds with the intention of capturing large opportunities in unmet or underserved medical conditions in dogs and cats. We are building a proprietary research and development pipeline, both through the application of our proprietary technologies and through strategic agreements, that provides access to promising therapeutic development opportunities within our focus areas. Our current therapeutic candidates are animal pharmaceuticals and biologics regulated by the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”) and immune-mediated biologics including monoclonal antibodies and cancer vaccines regulated by the USDA. Our development pipeline consists of one therapeutic for which we intend to seek conditional USDA licensure in 2017, three therapeutic candidates in pivotal studies, therapeutic candidates in pilot studies and other research stage projects.

We have incurred and will continue to incur research and development expense as we develop our business. Our research and development expenses were $30.5 million, $25.0 million and $20.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 Development Programs at the FDA 
 To begin the development process for our product candidates in the United States, we establish an Investigational New Animal Drug (“INAD”) file with the CVM. We then hold a pre-development meeting with the CVM to reach a general agreement on the plans for providing the data necessary to fulfill requirements for a New Animal Drug Application, or NADA. During development, we submit pivotal protocols to the CVM for review and concurrence prior to conducting the required studies. We gather and submit data on manufacturing, safety and effectiveness to the CVM for review, and this review is conducted according to timelines specified in the Animal Drug User Fee Act (“ADUFA”). Once all data have been submitted and reviewed for each technical section – safety, effectiveness and Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) – the CVM issues us a technical section complete letter as each section review is completed, and when the three letters have been issued, we compile a draft of the Freedom of Information Summary, the proposed labeling, and all other relevant information, and submit these as an administrative NADA for CVM review. Generally, if there are no deficiencies in the submission, the NADA is issued within 60 days after submission of the administrative NADA, as was the case with all three of our therapeutics that received FDA approval in 2016.  
 A separate approval either as an original or supplemental NADA is required for each species. In addition, additional indications and additional formulations to extend the lifecycle of our product candidates require separate approvals. By exploring new uses and methods, we may potentially be able to extend the patent life of our product candidates and achieve further differentiation in the marketplace.
 The following tables identify the most advanced product candidates being developed under the FDA CVM regulations and their current regulatory status:
 ﻿

 ﻿
 GALLIPRANT, ENTYCE and NOCITA were granted FDA approval in 2016 for use in dogs in the United States. We continue to develop therapeutics for other species from the same active ingredient and we consider these separate therapeutic candidates. Therefore, we refer to our therapeutic candidates that have not been approved or licensed with AT-XXX and species designation or the generic name and species designation (for instance, AT-002 for cats or capromorelin for cats). Similarly, when referring to potential indications that are being investigated, we also revert to the AT-XXX nomenclature with the investigational indication or generic name with the investigational indication. In addition, while our trademarks have been approved for use in the United States when we refer to the therapeutic candidate outside of the United States, we will also use the AT-XXX nomenclature. We believe the naming conventions in pet therapeutics, while potentially cumbersome, are important from a regulatory perspective to clearly indicate to veterinarians that the therapeutics are approved in specific species, indications and geography.
 GALLIPRANT (grapiprant tablets) for dogs
 GALLIPRANT, in-licensed from RaQualia, is a prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) EP4 receptor antagonist (PRA), a non-cyclooxygenase inhibiting, non-steroidal and anti-inflammatory drug. GALLIPRANT blocks PGE2-elicited pain and inflammation. In January 2016, we filed an administrative NADA with CVM for FDA approval of GALLIPRANT for the

control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs and approval was granted in March 2016. In April 2016, we announced that Elanco had licensed animal health rights to Grapiprant Products. The Elanco Agreements grant Elanco exclusive rights to develop, manufacture, market and commercialize Grapiprant Products globally outside the United States, along with co-promoting with us in the United States. In February 2016, we filed a marketing authorization application with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for grapiprant in dogs in the European Union (“EU”). The EMA has commenced the submission review process and we anticipate marketing authorization in 2017.
 AT-001 (grapiprant) for other indications 
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, Elanco has exclusive rights to Grapiprant Products globally outside the United States, and will provide updates on development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization plans in additional species and/or indications.
 ENTYCE (capromorelin oral solution) for dogs
 ENTYCE, also in-licensed from RaQualia, is a ghrelin receptor agonist and a new chemical entity to treat inappetence in dogs. The therapeutic is a flavored, oral liquid prescription product that works by mimicking ghrelin, the hunger hormone, to stimulate appetite. In March 2016, we filed an administrative NADA with CVM for FDA approval of ENTYCE for appetite stimulation in dogs and approval was granted in May 2016. We anticipate that ENTYCE will be commercially available by late-2017. See “Manufacturing and Supply Chain” below for additional information. We are also planning to investigate the use of capromorelin in other indications for dogs.
 AT-002 (capromorelin) for cats
 During the second quarter of 2016, we received concurrence from the FDA on the protocol for a pivotal field effectiveness study evaluating capromorelin for weight management in cats with chronic kidney disease, and we initiated the study in late-2016 using a cat-specific formulation. In 2017, we initiated a pivotal target animal safety study under FDA-concurred protocol. If capromorelin is approved in cats, it would be approved under a separate NADA and marketed as a distinct brand.    NOCITA (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) for dogs
 NOCITA, in-licensed from Pacira, is a long-acting, local anesthetic that lasts up to 72 hours post-surgery by releasing bupivacaine over time from multi-vesicular liposomes deposited in the tissue. The therapeutic is administered as a single dose by tissue infiltration during surgery closure. In June 2016, we filed an administrative NADA with CVM for FDA approval of NOCITA as a local post-operative anesthetic for cranial cruciate ligament surgery in dogs and approval was granted in August 2016. We are also conducting additional clinical work in other surgical procedures to potentially expand the label for NOCITA in dogs.  
 AT-003 (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) for cats
 In February 2016, we received concurrence from the FDA on the protocol for a pivotal field effectiveness study and in July 2016, we initiated the pivotal field effectiveness study for post-operative pain management in cats. During the third quarter of 2016, we began enrollment in the study and we anticipate results by mid-2017. In 2017, we completed a pivotal target animal safety study under FDA protocol concurrence which we believe helps support the safety of the therapeutic in cats. If the FDA accepts the efficacy and safety results, we plan to expand the NOCITA label to include cats.     AT-006 (eprociclovir) for cats
 AT-006 is an anti-viral for the treatment of feline herpes virus-induced ophthalmic conditions. During 2014, we completed a field study of AT-006, and we have subsequently been working on a refined formulation to meet the regulatory standards for both the United States and Europe and exploring how to move the product candidate into a pivotal field effectiveness study. We had been collaborating and sharing the cost of developing AT-006 with Elanco, but on May 11, 2016, we and Elanco agreed to terminate the Exclusive License, Development, and Commercialization Agreement that granted Elanco global rights for development and commercialization of licensed animal health products for AT-006. In consideration for the return of the global rights for AT-006, we will be required to pay Elanco a low single-digit royalty on product sales, if any, up to an amount in the low-single digit millions. We now fully control the global rights to AT-006, and we are planning to conduct a pilot study and eventually move forward with pivotal work, which if successful, would enable us to submit for regulatory approval for the product candidate.
 AT-016 (allogeneic adipose-derived stem cells) for dogs
 AT-016, which we in-licensed from VetStem exclusively in the United States for dogs, is an adipose-derived allogeneic stem cell therapeutic candidate for the potential treatment of osteoarthritis pain in dogs. As of April 2016, VetStem, who is responsible for development pursuant to a license agreement, received concurrence from the FDA on the protocol for a pivotal field effectiveness and safety study. During the third quarter of 2016, VetStem initiated the pivotal field effectiveness study for dogs with pain associated with osteoarthritis and we expect VetStem to share the results of the study in 2017. We anticipate VetStem to initiate the pivotal target animal safety study in 2017. We also believe that VetStem is making progress on the required CMC technical section.

AT-018 (timapiprant) for dogs
 AT-018, which we in-licensed from Atopix following an option period between the parties, is an oral CRTH2 antagonist for the potential treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. In October 2016, we and Atopix reviewed the high-level results of a multi-center, masked, placebo-controlled, randomized pilot field study in client-owned dogs with recurrent atopic dermatitis. The pilot study for AT-018 was designed to evaluate the product candidate’s ability to maintain the reduction of clinical signs in dogs with recurrent atopic dermatitis after receiving corticosteroids. The study design required that patients be pre-treated with prednisone, and the principle evaluation was based on subsequent differences in symptom scores in dogs that had responded to prednisone. Seventy-five dogs were enrolled in the study, but only approximately 40 percent of the cases were evaluable because of the unexpectedly high failure rate of prednisone. We do not believe that AT-018 demonstrated sufficient activity to merit continued development in this severe disease, and based on our recent discussions with the FDA, we plan to pursue an alternative clinical setting. Based on the encouraging laboratory studies, discussions with the FDA, and the fact that AT-018 appears well-tolerated, we intend to investigate AT-018 to prevent clinical signs in at-risk dogs. We intend to initiate a pilot study in 2017 to probe this new indication and we remain enthusiastic about continued development of AT-018.
 Development Programs at the USDA
 There are many parallels between the requirements to receive FDA approval for a veterinary pharmaceutical candidate and certain veterinary biologics candidates. The terminology differs, but the three main components are consistent, including efficacy, manufacturing and safety. USDA regulations are designed to ensure that veterinary biologics are pure, safe, potent and effective. The differences compared to FDA regulations are based on the immunological nature of the mode of action in biologics and the manufacturing process involving living organisms. In cases of emergencies, which means there is no licensed option available, the USDA will issue a time-limited conditional license after the manufacturing and safety requirements have been substantially fulfilled and a reasonable expectation of efficacy has been established. The applicant has to continue the pivotal efficacy study and the testing of the validation of the therapeutic. The conditional license can be extended if reasonable progress toward full licensure can be demonstrated.
 A unique requirement for veterinary biologics in the United States is that manufacturers must hold a United States Veterinary Biologics Establishment License to produce licensed veterinary biologics. An establishment license will only be issued if at least one biologic qualifies for a license. Applications for veterinary biologics establishments include: articles of incorporation for the applicant; qualifications of veterinary biologics personnel for key employees; water quality statement; facility blueprints; plot plans; and legends. Therapeutics in our pipeline regulated by the USDA:
 ﻿

 ﻿
 BLONTRESS and TACTRESS 
 BLONTRESS is a caninized monoclonal antibody with a full license from the USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics (“CVB”) since January 2015 as an aid for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma in dogs. TACTRESS is a caninized monoclonal antibody with a full licensure from the CVB since January 2016 as an aid for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma in dogs. 
 In the third quarter of 2015, our interim analysis of clinical results indicated that TACTRESS did not seem to be adding significant progression-free survival in canine T-cell lymphoma; those results were confirmed in the final study results in July 2016. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2016, we received final data from the Mini B-CHOMP study, which evaluated an abbreviated chemotherapy (CHOP) protocol in dogs with B-cell lymphoma. The results confirmed that BLONTRESS did not seem to be adding significant progression-free survival in canine B-cell lymphoma.

AT-014 for dogs 
 We are investigating AT-014, a novel her2/neu-directed cancer immunotherapy for the treatment of canine osteosarcoma, through an exclusive license agreement with Advaxis. During April 2016, we initiated a pivotal field safety study for AT-014. We have completed enrollment of dogs in the pivotal field safety study and we anticipate conditional licensure in the second half of 2017.
 Exclusive Option Programs
 As part of our therapeutic selection and development efforts, we enter into option agreements with human pharmaceutical companies to access potential candidates. These agreements are for a predetermined period of time and enable us to perform additional due diligence and further evaluate the potential candidate prior to entering into a license. We negotiate the terms of the license at the time of the option agreement and those terms become effective only if we exercise the option. Using this strategy, we have the ability to perform due diligence on multiple molecules in the same therapeutic class. In addition to exploring external candidates in our exclusive option program, we occasionally secure rights to additional candidates in conjunction with licensing deals.  Manufacturing and Supply Chain 
 We manage third-party manufacturers to supply API, drug product and packaged product for the development and commercialization of our small molecule product candidates. To ensure dependable and high quality supply, we have chosen to rely on Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) compliant contract manufacturer organizations (“CMO”) rather than devote capital and manpower toward developing or acquiring internal manufacturing facilities. We utilize CMO that have established track records of quality product supply and significant experience with regulatory requirements of both CVM and EMA. We believe we have or will have sufficient supply to conduct each of our currently contemplated studies and to commercialize our products. 
 As our products move from development-stage to commercial-stage, we work with the relevant CMO to make changes in the manufacturing process as required to complete process validation, scale-up capacity and to implement process improvements. Depending on the nature of the changes, we make supplemental manufacturing filings with the FDA to obtain the required approval to manufacture and sell products. As has been the case with each of our commercialized small molecule products, such transition and supplemental approval process can cause delays in making the first commercial sale following the initial approval.
 For GALLIPRANT, we have completed process validation and received FDA approval to sell the product. GALLIPRANT has been available to customers since January 2017. We continue to explore other potential changes in the manufacturing processes for GALLIPRANT, and if we implement those changes, we will be required to engage in additional interactions and/or make certain filings with the FDA before selling product manufactured under the new conditions.
 As part of the Collaboration Agreement with Elanco, we have agreed to provide commercial supply of GALLIPRANT until Elanco assumes manufacturing responsibility, which we anticipate will take place by the end of 2018. We charge Elanco for bulk API at a fixed price that can be above or below the actual API costs that we incur in manufacturing the product. Hence, depending on the API costs and other costs, we may be allowed to capture a manufacturing margin. We are also working on a technology transfer at our expense to secure redundant supply and capture process improvements for which, if we are successful, we are eligible for a $4.0 million milestone payment. We are generally not in the contract manufacturing business, and providing manufacturing services to Elanco is part of the more comprehensive relationship with Elanco with respect to GALLIPRANT, including the Co-Promotion Agreement.
 As we announced in February 2017, for ENTYCE, we continue to interact with the FDA on our filing in support of the transfer and scale-up of the manufacturing of API and formulated product with our CMO. As part of these regulatory interactions for ENTYCE, we received a response from the FDA on February 2, 2017, in connection with our prior-approval supplement (“PAS”) to transfer the manufacturing of ENTYCE to a new vendor in order to produce ENTYCE at commercial scale. The FDA has requested additional information regarding the proposed transfer in order to complete the review and approve the PAS, and we intend to work with the FDA to address its request. We plan to meet with the FDA in the second quarter of 2017, and we believe this meeting will help clarify the path forward. At this time, we continue to anticipate that ENTYCE will be commercially available by late-2017.
 For NOCITA, Pacira is our exclusive supplier and under our December 2012 supply agreement, Pacira is responsible for supplying us with finished drug product in vials. We are responsible for the labeling, packaging and shipping of NOCITA. We must submit rolling forecasts to Pacira with a portion of each forecast constituting a binding commitment. The term of the supply agreement extends for as long as the license agreement with Pacira continues in force. The license agreement has a term of fifteen years, until December 5, 2027, after which we have the option to renew the term for an additional five years. Pacira may terminate the supply agreement if we fail to make an undisputed payment, if we breach a material provision of the agreement, or if Pacira ceases manufacture of the drug product. Pacira also has the unilateral right to change its manufacturing process for the drug product. In this case, if we cannot reach agreement on the terms of continued supply of NOCITA meeting current specifications and Pacira decides that it is no longer commercially reasonable to supply us with drug product meeting such specifications, then Pacira may terminate the supply agreement. Our initial NOCITA supply is labeled with 24-month shelf life, and to comply with recent FDA guidance affecting our product, subsequent supply will be labeled with 12-month shelf life. We do not expect that this labeling change will impact our ability to market NOCITA.

We manufacture monoclonal antibody candidates and therapeutics at our USDA-licensed facility in San Diego, California. We perform all steps for production, including: cell line development; assay development; production in batch mode; fill and finish; release of products; and packaging. We believe our production capacity will provide modest but sufficient quantities to meet R&D and commercial supply requirements of our programs. Based on the results of the final clinical study and resulting market demand, we do not intend to produce additional TACTRESS, which we anticipate will result in the therapeutic no longer being commercially available when current supply expires in late-2017.
 Regarding our other USDA program, we have started the process to transfer the manufacturing of AT-014 from Advaxis to a third-party USDA-licensed CMO. We have the ability to expand the relationship with the CMO, subject to our needs and growth of current and/or future biologic therapeutics.
 Sales and Marketing
 Once a prescription-based therapeutic is approved by the appropriate regulatory authority and we have established commercial supply, we are allowed to commence selling the product. We focus on reaching the end-customer, the pet owner, through companion animal veterinarians. We reach companion animal veterinarians by utilizing a variety of tactics depending on the specific business situation for a particular product. We can market to companion animal veterinarians directly, which includes utilizing a sales force, telesales and selling to key accounts. Key accounts include corporate veterinary entities and group purchasing organizations. Our products can also reach companion animal veterinarians indirectly, which entails selling our products to independent distributors or commercial collaboration partners who in turn sell to companion animal veterinarians. Typically, direct selling and indirect selling are complementary efforts aimed at raising awareness of the product, generating customer interest and supporting a good customer experience. We may out-license the commercial rights to our product in some or all geographic territories whereby we are no longer involved in the commercialization efforts although in such situations we generally participate in the commercial success of a product through royalties and milestone payments.
 Historically, the companion animal veterinary industry has been focused on wellness needs of dogs and cats, including vaccinations, flea-tick prevention and parasite control. We believe that in recent years, the veterinary industry has begun evolving towards also addressing the medical needs of senior pets. This evolution is evidenced by the creation of more than twenty medical specialties and subspecialties of veterinary medicine, and it is also evidenced by the emergence of the modern, well-equipped pet hospitals providing a high level of medical care. We believe that the evolution of veterinary medicine is also reflected in pet owners’ attitudes: the majority of owners consider pets part of the family. We believe that the availability of new therapeutics can grow the veterinary medicine market. In light of the veterinarian’s goal of improving the health of pets and the ability to generate revenue from the sale of products, we believe veterinarians are motivated to prescribe innovative therapeutics that are safe, effective and supported by clinical data and regulatory approval.  
 In veterinary medicine, the pet owner is typically the payer as third-party insurance is much less common than in human medicine. For example, insurance covers less than 5% of pets in the United States. Because the payments are the responsibility of the pet owner, the pet owner tends to be involved in the purchase decision and is price conscious. We believe that making the pet owners aware of the benefits of a product is an important commercial consideration.
 The focus of our current commercial activities is the United States and its territories, commonwealths and possessions, and we generally attempt to out-license the commercial rights outside the United States. Data suggest that the United States represents one-third of the global animal health market. The pet market in Europe is similar in size to North America, and Latin America, Asia and the rest-of-the world constitutes the final one-third. We are working to complete the clinical and regulatory work required to get several of our products approved in Europe.
 According to independent market research commissioned by us, there are approximately 25,000 to 30,000 veterinary clinics in the United States. The research indicates that to target general practitioners with products like flea and tick medicine and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), a company would need to call on approximately 6,000 to 10,000 clinics to cover 50 percent of the revenue opportunity, whereas for more specialized products like oncology, a company can expect to cover 60 to 70 percent of the revenue opportunity in approximately 100 to 200 clinics across the United States. Therefore, we have evaluated and will continue to assess our approved, licensed therapeutics and late-stage pipeline therapeutic candidates to map the relevance to specialists and to evaluate how likely general practitioners are to adopt the therapeutics or therapeutic candidates, while taking into account the competitive landscape to define the sales strategy. Our strategy is intended to leverage a combination of direct sales, distribution, co-promotion agreements or contract selling agreements, and sales to corporate customers, such as the approximately 1,500 locations of the two largest corporate hospitals, and an eCommerce platform for veterinarians to purchase products directly from us.
 In 2016, to prepare for the expected commercial introduction of our therapeutics, we conducted pre-launch marketing activities, which included: identifying key differentiating features; conducting primary market research with key opinion leaders, veterinarians and pet owners on positioning and pricing; and preparing peer-reviewed journal articles and scientific presentations for delivery at veterinary conferences. Additionally, in 2016 we worked on finalizing the labeling for the therapeutics, developing pet-friendly formulations and user-friendly packaging to meet the needs of veterinarians and pet owners, as well as filing and/or registering trademarks in the key pet health markets.
 Currently, we have approximately 50 employees in our commercial team consisting of a chief operating officer, regional sales leaders, national account managers, therapeutic specialists, a veterinary medical director, veterinary medical liaisons, a sales director, a sales

operations director, a senior marketing director and marketing managers, pharmacovigilance, customer service and other operations personnel. We added approximately 30 sales team members to our team in the second half of 2016.
 In addition to a direct sales organization in the United States, we intend to use distributors and alternative delivery companies to expand our commercial reach in an efficient manner. There are a number of buying groups or group purchasing organizations in the animal health industry that have formed to gain volume-based pricing advantages. These organizations often work through a preferred distributor and these agreements are also set up on an annual contractual basis. We believe we have strategically balanced our direct sales organization with national and regional distributors to optimize our commercial efforts and allow us to provide coverage to a more expansive group of veterinary practices while incrementally growing our field sales organization.
 NOCITA (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension), a local post-operative analgesia for cranial cruciate ligament surgery in dogs, was made commercially available to veterinarians in the United States in October 2016 through our direct sales organization. In January 2017, GALLIPRANT (grapiprant tablets) to treat pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs was made commercially available to veterinarians in the United States through our commercial collaborator, Elanco, our sales organization, and distributors. We anticipate commercial availability of ENTYCE through our direct sales organization and distributors by late-2017. Outside the United States, Elanco has agreed to commercialize Grapiprant Products as part of our strategic collaboration and we plan to continue to explore similar opportunities for our other therapeutics outside the United States. Additionally, we continue to seek collaborations with companies where we can commercialize their approved pet therapeutics in the United States.
 GALLIPRANT (grapiprant tablets)
 GALLIPRANT is an EP4 prostaglandin receptor antagonist to treat pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs. See “Development Programs at the FDA-GALLIPRANT” for additional information.
 Market opportunity
 Analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs are often necessary to control pain in dogs with osteoarthritis. The currently approved products for control of the pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs are NSAIDs from the class of cyclooxygenase (“COX”) inhibitors. The arachidonic acid pathway constitutes the main mechanism for the production of pain and inflammation in osteoarthritis. This pathway also controls other important body functions such as kidney regulation, gastrointestinal mucosal protection, thrombosis and blood flow through the enzymatic synthesis of mediators in multiple steps along the pathway. Three COX isoenzymes have been identified—COX-1, COX-2 and COX-3. COX-2 initiates the biosynthesis of prostaglandin-I 2 or PGI 2 and prostaglandin-E 2 or PGE 2. PGI 2 affects gastrointestinal mucosa, kidney function and blood flow. PGE 2 also affects gastrointestinal mucosa and is a key mediator of pain and inflammation. The inhibition of COX enzymes to provide relief from pain and inflammation is the mode of action of NSAIDs. While side effects of the COX-inhibiting NSAID class in most dogs are generally mild and typical, some dogs have an idiosyncratic sensitivity that results in hepatic and/or gastrointestinal toxicity and, in extreme cases, death. As a result, COX-inhibiting NSAID label language contains bolded warnings and specifies that baseline blood tests should be conducted, and pets should be periodically monitored using blood tests to check for any toxic effects.
 We believe that GALLIPRANT will be used by veterinarians looking for alternatives to COX-inhibiting NSAIDs especially in dogs who do not tolerate COX-inhibiting NSAIDs or might otherwise be treated with nutritional supplements or alternative therapies. According to our market research, 94% of surveyed veterinarians stated that they were extremely likely or very likely to use GALLIPRANT assuming competitive pricing. A large majority of veterinarians surveyed indicated that they would adopt this product within the first year of it becoming available, and more than half of veterinarians said they would use GALLIPRANT earlier in the disease process versus the current marketed COX-inhibiting NSAIDs.
 We believe there is a significant market opportunity for treatment of osteoarthritis in dogs. According to market research, 14.7 million dogs are diagnosed with osteoarthritis each year. Of those dogs, 9.7 million are being treated for the condition, and 2.4 million are treated with NSAIDs for more than 20 days. According to market research, the total NSAID ex-manufacturer market in the United States is $357 million per year, $177 million of which represents treatment for acute pain and $180 million of which represents treatment for chronic pain.
 Commercial results
 As part of our Collaboration Agreement with Elanco on Grapiprant Products, Elanco has the lead responsibility for all commercial activities globally. Our commercial organization will participate in the commercial activities in the United States via our Co-Promotion Agreement. Elanco, rather than we, will record customer-level Grapiprant Products revenues, but we will record revenues related to our supply arrangement with Elanco, certain co-promotion fees and certain royalties and, if achieved, certain regulatory, manufacturing and commercial milestones. Hence, the commercial success of Grapiprant Products is very meaningful to us. See “GALLIPRANT Collaboration, License, Development and Commercialization and Co-Promotion Agreements with Elanco” for additional information.  
 ENTYCE (capromorelin oral solution)
 ENTYCE is a ghrelin receptor agonist for appetite stimulation in dogs. See “Development Programs at the FDA-ENTYCE” for additional information.

Medical need
 The control of hunger and satiety involves a complex system in mammals. In many acute and chronic disease states, as well as with aging, lack of appetite is a problem and can fuel a downward spiral. Malnutrition and decreased muscle mass can result from inadequate food intake regardless of the underlying condition. In humans, doctors can rationalize with the patients the importance of maintaining nutrition despite the lack of natural appetite and there are medical therapeutics approved in humans to treat inappetence. Veterinarians and pet owners cannot successfully rationalize with pets about the importance of maintaining nutrition and until recently there were no FDA approved medical therapeutics specifically designed to treat inappetence in pets. This can be a frustrating clinical situation for the veterinarian and pet owner and often contributes to the decision to euthanize a pet. In a recent survey of veterinarians 81% believed that stimulation of appetite and weight gain in dogs represented a significant unmet need. Fear, pain, stress, trauma, organic disease, dental disease, oral fractures and cancer are all possible causes of inappetence in pets. For example, in pets undergoing cancer treatment, the cancer therapy is commonly stopped when the pet loses appetite and body weight.
 According to our market research, inappetence is seen in approximately 23% of dogs who receive chemotherapy, although in clinical studies we observe inappetence rates to be lower but still clinically meaningful. We believe that, if approved for such indications, ENTYCE could be an important potential medicine in managing inappetence and weight in dogs with cancer. As a second example, inappetence and weight loss commonly occurs in conjunction with chronic renal failure (“CRF”). Dietary therapy with a diet that is designed for dogs with renal insufficiency is recommended regardless of the severity of disease. Unfortunately, many of the therapeutic diets that are prescribed may be less palatable to pets than normal diets. We believe that, if approved for such indication, ENTYCE could be an important medicine in managing inappetence and weight loss that occurs in connection with CRF. Other possible uses include inappetence associated with liver disease, cardiac disease, pancreatitis and gastrointestinal disorders.
 Currently available treatments and their limitations
 One of the first goals of therapy for inappetence is to correct the underlying cause. Often veterinarians will begin treatment of inappetence by recommending a change to a highly palatable diet such as tuna for cats and chicken or beef for dogs. Depending on the severity of the condition, the animal may be supported with fluids and electrolytes until the diagnosis of the underlying condition is made and effective treatment is initiated where possible. Prolonged or severe inappetence may require hospitalization and feeding tube placement. Drug therapy to address inappetence has focused primarily on human drugs affecting the central nervous system control of feeding such as benzodiazepines, cyproheptadine and mirtazapine. However, these drugs are not approved for veterinary use, have limited effectiveness and are contraindicated for cats with hepatic lipidosis. We have seen veterinarians using Cerenia (maropitant), which is indicated for the control of vomiting to determine whether the dog is inappetent due to nausea. We believe a significant number of veterinarians are not prescribing these therapies due to their limited safety and efficacy.
 Market opportunity
 We believe there is a significant market opportunity for a therapeutic that is safe and can effectively stimulate appetite in pets. According to market research, 9.8 million dogs in the United States are inappetent each year and 4.1 million of such dogs are treated for the condition (2.3 million dogs are being treated for acute inappetence and 1.8 million dogs are being treated for chronic inappetence). The large majority of veterinarians (87%) surveyed stated that they are extremely likely or very likely to use ENTYCE in chronic conditions, which is 40 days of therapy per year, assuming competitive pricing. By contrast 63% of veterinarians said they would use the product in acute conditions, which is 4 days of therapy per year, assuming competitive pricing. 
 NOCITA (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension)
 NOCITA provides local post-operative analgesia for up to 72 hours following cranial cruciate ligament surgery in dogs. See “Development Programs at the FDA-NOCITA” for additional information.
 Medical need
 Veterinarians perform approximately 20 million dog surgeries each year. Approximately 50% of dog surgeries are spays and neuters, while other common surgeries include cruciate repairs, fracture repairs, and cancer surgery. There is no established protocol for the use of pain medications in these surgeries and pain management practices have traditionally been based on the veterinarian’s views on the level of pain associated with a specific surgical procedure and the perceived pain tolerance of the pets. Recently, as pet owners have begun requesting analgesia for their pets’ painful conditions, veterinarians have made advances in treating pain in pets. Furthermore, animal research demonstrates that pain can have a detrimental effect on healing, and pain experts in academia and specialty practices are advocating more use of local anesthesia for pain control.
 Currently available treatments and their limitations
 The most widely used drugs approved for treatment of post-operative pain are COX-inhibiting NSAIDs and opioids in dogs and COX-inhibiting NSAIDs and buprenorphine and butorphanol in cats. In surgeries associated with the most severe post-operative pain, opioids including fentanyl are commonly used. Fentanyl is a controlled narcotic drug, and pets are often kept in the hospital while receiving fentanyl. In our experience, the majority of fentanyl is dispensed as fentanyl patches, although such use in pets has not been approved. In 2012, Nexcyon received FDA approval for a transdermal fentanyl solution, and Elanco launched the product in 2013 under the tradename Recuvyra. Use has been limited due to a number of label requirements relating to human safety and application. We believe that there are unmet needs in pets undergoing these more painful surgeries, especially if effective and extended pain relief 

 

9

 

could be achieved with a non-narcotic medicine. Among the drugs used for post-operative pain, some have been approved by the CVM, while others are used off label. The most commonly used post-operative pain medications in dogs are COX-inhibiting NSAIDs, which have been approved by the CVM for this use. COX-inhibiting NSAIDs have demonstrated significant side effects that result in prescribed monitoring of dog health during their use. Consequently, we believe veterinarians would appreciate a drug for post-operative use that was effective, but also safe on the liver, gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
 Market opportunity
 We believe that there is a significant market opportunity for the treatment of post-operative pain in dogs. According to market research, approximately 20 million dogs in the United States undergo surgery per year and of such dogs, 5.8 million have very painful expensive surgeries. Of the 5.8 million very painful surgeries in dogs, approximately 0.5 million are cranial cruciate ligament knee surgery. Our initial product indication covered in the product label for NOCITA is for post-operative analgesia for cranial cruciate ligament surgery, and we are not allowed to promote the use of NOCITA in surgeries other than those covered in our product label. However, our strategy is to complete additional clinical studies with NOCITA that we believe could result in FDA approval to extend our product label to cover other surgeries in cats and dogs.
 Commercial results
 In October 2016, in conjunction with our attendance at the American College of Veterinary Surgeons Surgery Summit in Seattle we commercially launched NOCITA. In the initial months since launch, the Company is focused on gaining access to the several hundred surgeons who frequently perform these procedures. To date, the access has been very good, and approximately 200 customers have placed initial orders for NOCITA. The next immediate commercial objective is to secure re-orders from customers that placed an initial order. Over the longer term, the commercial objective will be to expand the number of customers and establish the use of NOCITA as the standard of care. This effort has required, and the Company expects it will continue to require, significant effort by its sales force given the longer sales cycle than what the Company would expect with a general practice product.
 BLONTRESS (canine lymphoma monoclonal antibody, B-cell) and TACTRESS (canine lymphoma monoclonal antibody, T-cell)
 BLONTRESS and TACTRESS are currently available to all veterinary oncologists. Feedback from our oncology advisors and oncologists is that while improvements in median progression-free survival would have been important for broad use, there is interest to explore the product in individual dogs. Hence, we expect that some oncologists will continue to use BLONTRESS and TACTRESS in certain, limited settings.
 We believe the revenue and gross margin opportunity for the first generation monoclonal antibodies are very modest. However, given that there are not alternative monoclonal antibodies available to veterinary oncologists, we intend to maintain product availability and build awareness of lymphoma and monoclonal antibody therapy with BLONTRESS and TACTRESS during 2017 while we pursue second generation monoclonal antibodies and other product concepts in lymphoma. See “Manufacturing and Supply Chain” for additional information.
 Competition
 The development and commercialization of new animal health medicines is highly competitive, and we expect considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty animal health medicines companies. As a result, there are, and likely will continue to be, extensive research and substantial financial resources invested in the discovery and development of new animal health medicines. Our potential competitors include large animal health companies, such as Zoetis; Merck Animal Health, the animal health division of Merck & Co., Inc.; Elanco, the animal health division of Eli Lilly and Company; Bayer Animal Health, the animal health division of Bayer AG; Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, the animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; Virbac Group; Ceva Animal Health; Vetoquinol and Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC. We are also aware of several smaller early stage animal health companies, such as Nexvet, Jaguar Animal Health, Parnell Pharmaceuticals, VetDC and Kindred Bio that are developing products for use in the pet therapeutics market.
 Osteoarthritis is a competitive marketplace and Elanco will take the lead on commercial activities for Grapiprant Products. We expect ENTYCE to enter a new market where it is the only product approved for veterinary use to stimulate appetite. However, we are aware that some veterinarians utilize mirtazapine, a human generic antidepressant with known side effects and limited effectiveness, to treat inappetence, and we are aware that a company is pursuing FDA approval of mirtazapine for weight gain in cats. We expect NOCITA in dogs and cats will compete primarily with existing analgesics that are part of multi-modal pain protocols, including local anesthetics, opioids and cox-inhibiting NSAIDs. Regarding AT-014, we are aware of investigational candidates for osteosarcoma. For AT-016, we believe there are no approved allogenic stem cell treatments, however there are autologous procedures currently available.
 We are an emerging commercial company with a limited history of operations and many of our competitors have substantially more resources than we do, including both financial and technical resources. In addition, many of our competitors have more experience than we have in the development, manufacture, regulation and worldwide commercialization of animal health medicines. We are also competing with academic institutions, governmental agencies and private organizations that are conducting research in the field of animal health medicines. 
 Our competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which our products are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. Additionally, the timing of market introduction of some of our potential products or of competitors’ products 

 

10

 

may be an important competitive factor. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop our compounds, complete target animal studies and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities to market are expected to be important competitive factors. We expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based on various factors, including product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price and patent position.    Intellectual Property and License Agreements
 We seek to protect our products and technologies through a combination of patents, regulatory exclusivity, and proprietary know-how. Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current compounds and any future compounds for development, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. 
 We depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and inventions for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we generally require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. 
 Exclusive License Agreements with RaQualia 
 In December 2010, we entered into two agreements with RaQualia pursuant to which we exclusively licensed intellectual property rights relating to AT-001 and AT-002 in the animal health field. Pursuant to these agreements we obtained the rights to certain patents in the United States and other jurisdictions. The patents relating to AT-001 include composition of matter claims as well as claims to methods of use of AT-001. The patent rights relating to the use of AT-001 further include methods of preparing the compounds of interest and salts, polymorphs and intermediates thereof, as well as certain combination therapies. Additionally, we licensed from RaQualia additional patent rights relating to AT-002 that include composition of matter claims as well as claims to methods of use of AT-002. Under these agreements, we were granted exclusive, worldwide licenses to develop, manufacture and commercialize AT-001 and AT-002 in the field of animal health, except that we cannot develop, manufacture or commercialize injectable AT-001 products in Japan, South Korea, China or Taiwan. We have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties under these agreements. Under our agreement with RaQualia, we are responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize AT-001 and AT-002. The patent that we believe covers the crystalline form of the AT-001 compound to be marketed expires on February 21, 2027 and is expected to be eligible for a patent term extension of 2.5 to 3 years to 2029-2030. There are also two patents on methods of producing the AT-002 compound which expire on February 1, 2020 and February 13, 2020, respectively, with potential term extension of about 2.5 years to 2022 or early 2023. Each of these potential patent term extensions are dependent on certain FDA approval dates of commercial use of the corresponding product. The patents and applications licensed under these agreements are expected to expire between 2017 and 2034. 
 We are responsible for contingent milestone payments upon achievement of development and regulatory milestones and royalties on net sales of licensed products, subject to certain potential offsets and deductions, under each of the AT-001 and AT-002 agreements, and the royalty percentage is in the mid-single digits. We must also pay to RaQualia a portion of royalties we receive from any sublicensees, subject to a minimum royalty on net sales by such sublicensees. Our royalty obligations apply on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, and end upon the expiration or abandonment of all patents with valid claims covering a licensed product in a given country. 
 Each of the AT-001 and AT-002 agreements continues until terminated. RaQualia may terminate the AT-001 agreement or the AT-002 agreement if we fail to pay any undisputed fee under the relevant agreement and do not cure such failure within 60 days after RaQualia notifies us of such failure. We may terminate the AT-001 agreement or the AT-002 agreement, or any license granted under either agreement, on a patent-by-patent and country-by-country basis at will, upon 30 days’ prior written notice to RaQualia. Once all of the patents licensed under the AT-001 agreement or the AT-002 agreement have expired or been abandoned, the licenses granted under the relevant agreement become fully-paid and irrevocable. 
 Exclusive License Agreement with Pacira 
 In December 2012, we entered into an exclusive license agreement and related exclusive supply agreement with Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Pacira. Under the license agreement, we were granted an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize, but not to manufacture, AT-003 in the veterinary field. Pursuant to this agreement we obtained the rights to certain patent rights relating to AT-003 including composition of matter claims and methods of use thereof. The patents and applications relating to AT-003 are expected to expire between 2015 and 2031. 
 We have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties outside the United States upon Pacira’s approval. Any sublicenses we wish to grant to third parties within the United States must be discussed with Pacira and approved by Pacira in its sole discretion and good 

 

11

 

faith reasonable business judgment. We are responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize AT-003, and for launching AT-003 within a specified time period following regulatory approval in certain countries. 
 We paid Pacira an upfront fee and are responsible for contingent milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones and for royalties on net sales of AT-003 by us and our affiliates, with a tiered royalty percentage in the low- to mid-20s. We must pay Pacira a royalty on net sales of AT-003 by us and our affiliates, subject to certain reductions. We must also pay to Pacira a percentage of all payments we receive from any sublicensee, subject to certain offsets, and under certain circumstances, share a portion of Pacira’s royalty payment obligations to its third-party licensors. We are responsible for meeting minimum annual revenue requirements for AT-003 beginning the fifth year after the first commercial sale of AT-003. If we fail to meet these requirements, either we or Pacira may terminate the license agreement. 
 The term of the license agreement extends for 15 years, until December 5, 2027, after which we have the option to renew the term for an additional five years. Pacira may terminate the agreement in its entirety if we fail to pay any amount due within a specified time period, or on a country-by-country basis if we fail to achieve certain regulatory, clinical and commercial milestones within certain timeframes. We may terminate the agreement on a country-by-country basis either upon the entry of a generic competitor, or at will outside the United States or the European Union. Either we or Pacira may terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches or files for bankruptcy and fails to cure such breach within a specified time period, or if we do not pay the minimum annual revenue requirements referenced above. The agreement automatically terminates if Pacira terminates the related supply agreement and if certain circumstances involving a United States sublicensee occur and we do not meet certain financial obligations to Pacira. 
 Vet Therapeutics 
 As part of our Vet Therapeutics acquisition, we acquired a patent family related to the speciesization of antibodies that cover all Vet Therapeutics products with an issued patent expiring in 2029. We also acquired a patent family related to antibody constant domain regions and uses thereof, which also covers all Vet Therapeutics products and has an issued United States patent expiring in 2032. Finally, we acquired patent filings that cover specific canine monoclonal antibodies directed to various targets, including an issued United States patent directed to the canine CD 52 development antibody, which will expire in 2029. 
 Aratana NV
 As part of our January 2014 acquisition of Okapi Sciences, we acquired certain patent rights that cover formulations of AT-006 and methods of making the active ingredient of AT-006. These applications, if granted into patents, would expire in 2032 and 2031, respectively. We also have a license to certain patent rights that covers composition and methods of use of AT-008. These patent rights, if the patent applications included therein issue, will expire between 2024 and 2027.
 GALLIPRANT Collaboration, License, Development and Commercialization and Co-Promotion Agreements with Elanco
 On April 22, 2016, we entered into a Collaboration, License, Development and Commercialization Agreement (“Collaboration Agreement”) with Elanco that granted Elanco rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Grapiprant Products, an FDA-approved therapeutic for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs. Elanco will have exclusive rights globally outside the United States and co-promotion rights with us in the United States during the term of the Collaboration Agreement.    Elanco paid us an upfront payment of $45.0 million. Elanco has also agreed to pay us a $4.0 million milestone related to European approval of Grapiprant Products for the treatment of pain and inflammation, a $4.0 million milestone related to the manufacturing of Grapiprant Products and up to $75 million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. The sales milestone payments are subject to a one third reduction for each year the occurrence of the milestone is not achieved beyond December 31, 2021, with any non-occurrence beyond December 31, 2023 cancelling out the applicable milestone payment obligation entirely.
 Elanco will also pay us royalty payments on a percentage of net sales in the mid-single to low-double digits. In addition, we and Elanco have agreed to pay 25% and 75%, respectively, of all third-party development fees and expenses through December 31, 2018, in connection with preclinical and clinical trials necessary for any registration or regulatory approval of the products (“Registration”), provided that our contribution to such development fees and expenses is capped at mid-single digit millions. We are responsible for all development activities required to obtain the first Registration for Grapiprant Products for use in dogs in each of the European Union and the United States, and Elanco is responsible for all other development activities.
 The term of the collaboration will continue throughout the development and commercialization of the product candidates, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest of (i) the date on which no valid claim of certain issued or granted patents specified in the Collaboration Agreement in the respective country exists, (ii) the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity in such country covering such Grapiprant Product, and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
 The Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by Elanco at any time upon 90 days’ written notice to us. The Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by either party (i) for the other party’s material breach, where such breach is not cured within the timeframe specified by the agreement, (ii) upon the bankruptcy, insolvency or dissolution of the other party, or (iii) for certain activities involving the challenge of certain patents licensed by us to Elanco. Upon Elanco’s voluntary termination or termination for Elanco’s breach, among other things, (a) all licenses and rights granted to Elanco will terminate and revert to us, and (b) Elanco has 

 

12

 

agreed to assign to us all registrations and trademarks obtained in connection with the Grapiprant Products. Upon termination for our breach, among other things, Elanco may elect to retain its rights to the licenses granted by us under the Collaboration Agreement subject to specified payment obligations.
 Elanco paid us an upfront fee and is responsible for contingent milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory, development and commercial milestones and for royalties on net sales of Grapiprant Products by themselves and their affiliates, with a tiered royalty percentage in the mid-single to low-double digits. In addition, we and Elanco have agreed to pay 25% and 75%, respectively, of all third-party development fees and expenses through December 31, 2018. 
 On April 22, 2016, in connection with the Collaboration Agreement, we entered into a Co-Promotion Agreement (“Co-Promotion Agreement”) with Elanco to co-promote the Grapiprant Products in the United States.
 Under the terms of the Co-Promotion Agreement, Elanco has agreed to pay us, as a fee for services performed and expenses incurred by us under the Co-Promotion Agreement, (i) 25% of the gross margin on net sales of Product sold in the United States under the Collaboration Agreement prior to December 31, 2018 (unless extended by mutual agreement), and (ii) a mid-single digit percentage of net sales of the Product in the United States after December 31, 2018 through 2028 (unless extended by mutual agreement).
 The Co-Promotion Agreement expires on December 31, 2028, unless extended by mutual agreement. In addition, the Co-Promotion Agreement provides that it will automatically terminate if the Collaboration Agreement is terminated early.
 Regulatory 
 The development, approval and sale of animal health products are governed by the laws and regulations of each country in which we intend to sell our products. To comply with these regulatory requirements, we have established processes and resources to provide oversight of the development and launch of our products and their maintenance in the market. Requirements for Approval of Veterinary Pharmaceuticals for Pets
 As a condition to regulatory approval for sale of animal products, regulatory agencies worldwide require that a product to be used for pets be demonstrated to:
﻿ | | 
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | • | be safe for the intended use in the intended species; 
﻿ | | 
 | • | have substantial evidence of effectiveness for the intended use; 
﻿ | | 
 | • | have a defined manufacturing process that ensures that the product can be made with high quality consistency; and
﻿ | | 
 | • | be safe for humans handling the product and for the environment. 

  Safety. To determine that a new veterinary drug is safe for use, regulatory bodies will require us to provide data from a safety study generated in laboratory cats and dogs tested at doses higher than the intended label dose, over a period of time determined by the intended length of dosing of the product. In the case of the CVM, the design and review of the safety study and the study protocol are completed prior to initiation of the study to help assure that the data generated will meet FDA requirements. These studies are conducted under rigorous quality control, including Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”), to assure integrity of the data. They are designed to clearly define a safety margin, identify any potential safety concerns, and establish a safe dose for the product. This dose and effectiveness is evaluated in the pivotal field effectiveness study where the product is studied in the animal patient population in which the product is intended to be used. Field safety data, obtained in a variety of breeds and animals kept under various conditions, are evaluated to assure that the product will be safe in the target population. Safety studies are governed by regulations and regulatory pronouncements that provide the parameters of required safety studies and are utilized by regulatory bodies in the United States, the European Union, Japan and other countries.
 Effectiveness. Early pilot studies may be done in laboratory cats or dogs to establish effectiveness and the dose range for each product. Data on how well the drug is absorbed when dosed by different routes and the relationship of the dose to the effectiveness are studied. When an effective dose is established, a study protocol to test the product in real world conditions is developed prior to beginning the study. In the case of the CVM, the pivotal effectiveness field study protocol is submitted for review and concurrence prior to study initiation, to help assure that the data generated will meet requirements. The pivotal field effectiveness study must be conducted with the formulation of the product that is intended to be commercialized, and is a multi-site, randomized, controlled study, generally with a placebo control. To reduce bias in the study, individuals doing the assessment are not told whether the subject is in the group receiving the treatment being tested or the placebo group. For pharmaceuticals, in both the United States and the European Union, the number of patients enrolled in the pivotal field effectiveness studies is required to be approximately 100 to 150 animal subjects treated with the test product and a comparable number of subjects in the control group that receive the placebo. In many cases, a pivotal field study may be designed with clinical sites in both the European Union and the United States, and this single study may satisfy regulatory requirements in both the European Union and the United States.
 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls. To assure that the product can be manufactured consistently, regulatory agencies will require us to provide documentation of the process by which the API is made and the controls applicable to that process that assure the API and the formulation of the final commercial product meet certain criteria, including purity and stability. For FDA and EMA approvals, both pharmaceutical API and commercial formulations are required to be manufactured at facilities that practice cGMP. After a product is approved, we will be required to communicate with the regulatory bodies any changes in the procedures or manufacturing 

 

13

 

site. For example, with regard to FDA-regulated products, different reporting requirements apply depending on the scope and extent of post-approval changes to the CMC. Generally, “major changes” (as defined in the FDA’s guidance documents) require a PAS filing, which has a 120-day review period by the FDA and must be approved by the FDA before distribution or sale of the product. “Moderate changes” (as defined in the FDA’s guidance documents) can be filed as a Supplement Changes Being Effected in 30 Days (“CBE30”) or as a Supplement Changes Being Effected (“CBE0”). Products manufactured involving changes filed as a CBE30 can be distributed and/or sold within 30 days of receipt of the CBE30 by the FDA or immediately if filed with the FDA as a CBE0. No affirmative approval is required by the FDA for those categories of changes. Finally, “minor changes” (as defined in the FDA’s guidance documents) are simply required to be provided to the FDA by companies in their annual reports on CMC application matters titled Minor Changes and Stability Reports. 
 Environmental and Human Safety. We will not be required under United States law to provide an environment impact statement for products currently in development if the products are given at the home of the pet’s owner or in a veterinary hospital. If products might result in some type of environmental exposure or release, the environmental impact must be assessed. For approval in the EU, a risk assessment for potential human exposure will be required.
 Labeling, All Other Information, and Freedom of Information Summary. We also will be required to submit the intended label for the product, and also any information regarding additional research that has been conducted with the drug, to the CVM and other regulatory bodies for review. We will draft, and submit for regulatory review, the Freedom of Information Summary for use in the United States. This summary outlines the studies and provides substantial information that CVM uses to assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness and then publishes on its website.
 United States
 Three federal regulatory agencies regulate the health aspects of animal health products in the United States: the FDA; the USDA; and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”).
 The CVM at the FDA regulates animal pharmaceuticals under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. The CVB at the USDA regulates veterinary vaccines and some biologics pursuant to the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act. The EPA regulates veterinary pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. Many topical products used for treatment of flea and tick infestations are regulated by the EPA.
 Our current product candidates are animal pharmaceuticals regulated by the CVM and animal biologics regulated by the USDA. Manufacturers of animal health pharmaceuticals, including us, must show their products to be safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture. The CVM’s basis for approving a drug application is documented in a Freedom of Information Summary. We will be required to conduct post-approval monitoring of FDA- and EMA-approved pharmaceutical products and to submit reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results to the CVM’s Surveillance and Compliance group.
 Regulatory Process at the FDA
 To begin the development process for our products in the United States, we establish an INAD, file with the CVM. We then hold a pre-development meeting with the CVM to reach a general agreement on the plans for providing the data necessary to fulfill requirements for an NADA. During development, we submit pivotal protocols to the CVM for review and concurrence prior to conducting the required studies. We gather and submit data on manufacturing, safety and effectiveness to the CVM for review, and this review is conducted according to timelines specified in the ADUFA. Once all data have been submitted and reviewed for each technical section – safety, effectiveness and CMC – the CVM issues us a technical section complete letter as each section review is completed, and when the three letters have been issued, we compile a draft of the Freedom of Information Summary, the proposed labeling, and all other relevant information, and submit these as an administrative NADA for CVM review. Generally, if there are no deficiencies in the submission, the NADA is issued within 60 days after submission of the administrative NADA. After approval, we will be required to collect reports of adverse events and submit them on a regular basis to the CVM.
 The CVM has an alternative approval process for drugs used in minor species, or for drugs that are used for a ‘minor use’ in a major species. This process is called MUMS which stands for minor use, minor species. For example, if it can be documented that the population of cats or dogs that contract a specific condition is below a specified number, a company can apply to the CVM for MUMS designation. Once designation has been granted, then we must submit the same safety and CMC data as required for a full NADA, and also submit some evidence of effectiveness. After a review period, the CVM can then grant a conditional approval. This approval allows for the commercialization of the product, while completing the pivotal effectiveness study required for a full NADA. Because in many cases the CMC section of the submission takes the longest, MUMS conditional approval may not shorten the time to commercialization. Following submission, review and approval of the pivotal field effectiveness study, the CVM may grant a full NADA.
 Requirements for Approval of Certain Veterinary Biologics for Pets
 There are many parallels between the requirements to receive approvals for a veterinary pharmaceutical product candidates and certain veterinary biologics product candidates. The terminology differs, but the three main components are the same: efficacy, manufacturing, and safety. USDA regulations are designed to ensure that veterinary biologics are pure, safe, potent 

 

14

 

and effective. The differences compared to pharmaceutical product regulations are based on the immunological nature of the mode of action of the product and the manufacturing process involving living organisms.
 Efficacy. Documentation requirements depend significantly on product type and typically include data from preliminary dose determination studies and master seed immunogenicity/efficacy studies.
 Safety. Typical safety documentation includes safety data from laboratory animal studies, typically rodents, studies in host animals, typically laboratory dogs or cats, in biocontainment, and field safety studies conducted in client-owned animals.
 Manufacturing. The required documentation must include an Outline of Production, Master Seed Reports, and Summary Information Formats, or SIFs, for novel live biological products and products based on recombinant DNA technology. SIFs contain additional safety and identity data to establish proper biocontainment requirements and to conduct confirmatory testing. Other supportive documentation is product-type specific and includes in-process procedures and corresponding validation reports, potency test development report, stability reports, and veterinary biologics production and test for satisfactory three consecutive prelicensing serials (numbered lots) of product.
 Other information. This includes labels or label sketches.
 A unique requirement for veterinary biologics in the United States is that manufacturers must hold a United States Veterinary Biologics Establishment License to produce licensed veterinary biologicals. An establishment license will only be issued if at least one biological product qualifies for a license. Applications for veterinary biologics establishments include articles of incorporation for the applicant, qualifications of veterinary biologics personnel for key employees, water quality statement, facility blueprints, plot plans, and legends.
 Regulatory Process at the USDA
 Applicants are encouraged to contact the CVB early in the product development process. A licensing reviewer will be assigned to help with the regulatory process. Initially, the CVB will confirm that the proposed product meets the definition of a veterinary biologic and is subject to regulation by the CVB. The CVB then recommends that applicants submit a licensing plan, including pivotal study protocols, to the CVB for review and comment prior to initiating work that will be used to support product licensure. The USDA provides a complete list of guidance documents named “Veterinary Services Memorandums” that lay out the data requirements and regulatory process. Applicants that do not hold a United States Veterinary Biologics Establishment License need to submit the required documentation for the establishment and the product concurrently.
 Study protocols and reports can be submitted any time after the initial applications have been made. The administrative process is facilitated by forms (APHIS Forms) that accompany the submissions and capture regulatory actions. There is no requirement to submit parts of dossiers or entire dossiers. The CVB provides official responses to submissions in hard copy mail indicating if more data are needed or that the submission was satisfactory to support licensure. When master seed and master cell reports have been found to be satisfactory, samples have to be submitted to the CVB laboratory for confirmatory testing. Once all requirements have been satisfactorily met, the CVB will issue a veterinary biological product license.
 In cases of emergencies, which means there is no approved product available, the USDA will issue a time-limited conditional license after the manufacturing and safety requirements have been substantially fulfilled and a reasonable expectation of efficacy has been established. The applicant has to continue the pivotal efficacy program and product testing validation. The conditional license can be extended if reasonable progress towards full licensure can be demonstrated.
 There are no statutory review times. Submissions enter the review queue in chronological order. Hence predictions of development timelines and time to approval are difficult to make. However, we believe the typical time to achieve conditional licensure is approximately three years and the typical time to achieve full licensure is approximately five years.
 Furthermore, while the CVB regulates certain biologics (for instance, based on the immunological nature of the mode of action) the CVM regulates other biologics in a manner described under “Regulatory Process at the FDA.”
 European Union
 The EMA regulates the scientific evaluation of applications for marketing authorizations via the centralized procedure for medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU. Its veterinary review section is distinct from the review section for human drugs. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (“CVMP”), is responsible for scientific review of the submissions for animal pharmaceuticals and vaccines. However, the European Commission is responsible for the grant of EU marketing authorizations. Once a centralized marketing authorization is granted by the European Commission, it is valid throughout the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (meaning the 28 member states of the EU plus, by extension pursuant to the EEA Agreement, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). The centralized procedure is mandatory for approval of certain veterinary medicines, including those derived from biotechnology processes and veterinary medicines for use as growth or yield enhancers. Other veterinary medicines may be approved centrally if the product contains a new active substance or if the applicant can demonstrate to the CVMP that the product is sufficiently innovative. We believe our current product candidates contain new active substances or are sufficiently innovative and thus will be subject to central approval.

For all other products, the competent authorities of the EU Member States are responsible for granting marketing authorizations for products that are sold in their markets. Applicants who intend to market such products in more than one Member State may seek marketing authorizations under the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure, which are procedures designed to streamline and harmonize approval in multiple EU Member States. If the product has already been authorized in one Member State, the mutual recognition procedure facilitates mutual recognition of the existing authorization, so called reference Member State approval, in another Member State. The decentralized procedure, on the other hand, may be used in cases where the product has not received a marketing authorization in any Member State. Under this procedure, the applicant submits an identical dossier to each relevant Member State, and one, known as the reference Member State, takes the lead in reviewing the application. Under both procedures, other Member States are required to accept the reference Member State’s view on the approvability of the product unless they can identify significant public health reasons not to do so.
 In general, the requirements for regulatory approval of an animal health product in the EU are similar to those in the United States, requiring demonstrated evidence of purity, safety, efficacy and consistency of manufacturing processes.
 European Regulatory Process
 The EMA is responsible for coordinating scientific evaluation of applications for marketing approval via the centralized procedure for pet therapeutics in the EU. To perform these evaluations, the EMA established a specific scientific committee, the CVMP. The CVMP considers applications submitted by companies for the marketing approval of individual pet therapeutics and evaluates whether or not the medicines meet the necessary quality, safety and efficacy requirements. Assessments conducted by the CVMP are based on scientific criteria and are intended to ensure that pet therapeutics reaching the marketplace have a positive benefit-risk balance in favor of the pet population they are intended for. Based on the CVMP’s recommendation, a centralized marketing authorization is granted by the European Commission, which allows the product to be marketed throughout the EEA. The CVMP is also responsible for various post-authorization and maintenance activities, including the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization.
 To obtain a centralized marketing authorization from the European Commission, we must submit a marketing authorization application called a dossier. The dossier is the EMA’s equivalent of the FDA’s NADA and includes data from studies showing the quality, safety and efficacy of the product. The CVMP reviews and evaluates the dossier. For any dossier, a rapporteur and co-rapporteur are appointed from the members of the CVMP. Their role is to lead the scientific evaluation and prepare the assessment report. The rapporteur can utilize experts to assist it in performing its assessment. The report is critiqued by the co-rapporteur and other members of the CVMP before the CVMP makes its determination. The final opinion of the CVMP is generally given within 210 days of the submission of a dossier.
 For products that are not eligible for centralized approval, the competent authorities of the EU Member States are responsible for granting marketing authorizations for products that are sold in their markets. Such products may be approved nationally in one Member State, or in multiple Member States via the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure.
 In the EU, products for MUMS are eligible for regulatory incentives such as free scientific advice and fee reductions. These incentives may apply, for example, if it can be documented that the population of cats or dogs that contract a specific condition is below a specified number in Europe. However, the EMA recently announced that fee reductions are only applicable to products indicated for food-producing species. An applicant may apply to the EMA for MUMS classification for any product irrespective of the intended route of approval (i.e. centralized, decentralized or national approval) and incentives may be requested for all routes of authorization. The CVMP has established guidelines specific to MUMS for data requirements, which apply to all sections of the application, i.e. quality, safety and efficacy. Consequently, there may be scope for a reduced quality data package. Similarly, the safety and efficacy sections might be abridged to a certain extent (more flexibility for the combination of dose-determination, dose-confirmation and field studies) provided reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness are submitted. However, the CVMP and national veterinary medicines regulators have significant discretion in this respect. Overall, data requirements for demonstrating quality, efficacy and safety in the target species for minor use indications of a new medicine will be determined on a case-by-case basis and any potential applicant should seek scientific advice on specific data requirements to guide its research and development activities.
 There are three different procedures to receive a marketing authorization (regulatory approval) in Europe, the decentralized procedure (“DCP”), the mutual recognition procedure (“MRP”), and the centralized procedure (“CP”). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain products and technologies, for example biopharmaceuticals, gene therapy products, somatic cell therapeutic products or certain therapeutic areas, for example oncology or neurodegenerative disorders. Otherwise the sponsor can opt between CP and DCP.
 An application for CP is submitted to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) which coordinates the scientific evaluation. To perform these evaluations, the EMA established a specific scientific committee, the CVMP. The CVMP evaluates whether the medicines meet the necessary quality, safety and efficacy requirements. Assessments conducted by the CVMP are based on scientific criteria and are intended to ensure that pet therapeutics reaching the marketplace have a positive benefit-risk balance in favor of the pet population they are intended for. Based on the CVMP’s recommendation, a centralized marketing authorization is granted by the European Commission, which allows the product to be marketed in any 

 

16

 

of the EU states. The CVMP is also responsible for various post-authorization and maintenance activities, including the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization.
 To obtain authorization from the EMA through CP, we must submit a marketing authorization application called a dossier, which consists of four parts. Part 1 includes administrative information, part 2 quality documentation, part 3 safety documentation, and part 4 efficacy documentation. For any dossier, a rapporteur and co-rapporteur are appointed from the members of the CVMP. Their role is to lead the scientific evaluation and prepare the assessment report. The rapporteur can utilize experts to assist it in performing its assessment. The entire regulatory assessment period is limited to 210 days, which is divided in three periods. After an initial review period of 120 days the sponsor receives a list of questions and the clock is stopped. With the submission on the response the clock starts again and after a 60-days review period the CVMP discusses a draft opinion and the clock is stopped. If felt necessary, an oral explanation is offered. In the last 30 days of the review period the CVMP finalizes the opinion and the assessment report. 
 A DCP can be used for products that have not been approved in any of the EU member states and do not fall under mandatory CP. The sponsor selects one Reference Member State (“RMS”) and one or more Concerned Member States (“CMS”). The RMS leads the scientific evaluation and with the input from CMS issues the initial and final assessment report. The regulatory assessment period is similar to the CP and divided into two periods of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The procedure ends with a consensus decision and leads to products approval in the RMS and CMS.
 The MRP must be used for products that have been approved in at least one EU member state either by national procedure or DCP. The MRP uses an existing and if needed updated assessment report to extend marketing authorizations to more EU member states.
 Rest of World
 Each other country has its own regulatory requirements for approving and marketing veterinary pharmaceuticals. For example, in Brazil, the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Products and Supply (“MAPA”), is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and feed additives for animal use. MAPA’s regulatory activities are conducted through the Secretary of Agricultural Defense and its Livestock Products Inspection Department. In addition, regulatory activities are conducted at a local level through the Federal Agriculture Superintendence. These activities include the inspection and licensing of both manufacturing and commercial establishments for veterinary products, as well as the submission, review and approval of pharmaceuticals, biological and feed additives.
 In Australia, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (“APVMA”), is the Australian government statutory authority for the registration of all agricultural and veterinary products. The APVMA assesses applications from manufacturers of veterinary pharmaceuticals and related products.
 Many country specific regulatory laws contain provisions that include requirements for labeling, safety, efficacy and manufacturers’ quality control procedures to assure the consistency of the products, as well as company records and reports. With the exception of the EU, the regulatory agencies of most other countries generally refer to the FDA, USDA, EMA, and other international animal health entities, including the World Organization for Animal Health and the Codex Alimentarius Commission, in establishing standards and regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines.
 Other Regulatory Considerations
 Regulatory rules relating to human food safety, food additives, or drug residues in food will not apply to the products we currently are developing because our products are not intended for use in food production animals.
 Advertising and promotion of animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries. These rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those claims and uses that have been reviewed and endorsed by the applicable agency. We will conduct a review of advertising and promotional material for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell pet therapeutics.
