Item 1.    Description of Business.
General Overview
State Bank Financial Corporation (the "Company") is a bank holding company that was incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia in January 2010 to serve as the holding company for State Bank and Trust Company (the "Bank" or "State Bank"). State Bank is a Georgia state-chartered bank that opened in October 2005 in Pinehurst, Georgia, which initially operated as a small community bank with two branch offices located in Dooly County, Georgia. Between July 24, 2009 and December 31, 2016, we successfully completed 16 bank acquisitions totaling $5.1 billion in assets and $4.5 billion in deposits. State Bank principally operates through 31 full-service branches throughout seven of Georgia's eight largest metropolitan statistical areas, or MSAs. 
 In this report, unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to "we," "us," and "our" refer to State Bank Financial Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary, State Bank. Additionally, we refer to each of the financial institutions we have acquired collectively as the "Acquired Banks."
As a result of our acquisitions, we have transformed from a small community bank to a much larger commercial bank. We offer a variety of community banking services to individuals and businesses within our markets. Our product lines include loans to small and medium-sized businesses, residential and commercial construction and development loans, commercial real estate loans, farmland and agricultural production loans, residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, consumer loans and a variety of commercial and consumer demand, savings and time deposit products. We also offer online banking and bill payment services, online cash management, safe deposit box rentals, debit card and ATM card services and the availability of a network of ATMs for our customers. In addition to the banking services noted above, we offer payroll and insurance services, through Altera Payroll and Insurance, a division of State Bank, to small and medium-size businesses. These services include fully automated human resources information system, payroll, benefits and labor management.
At December 31, 2016, our total assets were approximately $4.2 billion, our total loans receivable were approximately $2.8 billion, our total deposits were approximately $3.4 billion and our total shareholders' equity was approximately $613.6 million. The Company is headquartered at 3399 Peachtree Road, N.E., Suite 1900, Atlanta, Georgia 30326. State Bank's main office is located at 4219 Forsyth Road, Macon, Georgia 31210.
Our History and Growth
On July 24, 2009, State Bank raised approximately $292.1 million in gross proceeds (before expenses) from investors in a private offering of its common stock. Since that date and through October 2011, State Bank has acquired $3.9 billion in total assets and assumed $3.6 billion in deposits from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), as receiver, in 12 different failed bank acquisition transactions.

Concurrent with each of our failed bank acquisitions, we entered into loss share agreements with the FDIC that covered certain of the acquired loans and other real estate owned. Historically, we have referred to loans subject to loss share agreements with the FDIC as “covered loans” and loans that are not subject to loss share agreements with the FDIC as “noncovered loans.” However, with the early termination of all of our loss share agreements as discussed below, we now segregate our loan portfolio into the following three categories:
(1) organic loans, which refers to loans not purchased in the acquisition of an institution or credit impaired portfolio,
(2) purchased non-credit impaired loans ("PNCI"), which refers to loans acquired in our acquisitions that did not show 
signs of credit deterioration at acquisition, and
(3) purchased credit impaired loans ("PCI"), which refers to loans we acquired that, at acquisition, we determined it was 
probable that we would be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest payments due.
All of the loans we acquired in our 12 FDIC assisted transactions, which we refer to as our failed bank transactions, and all of the loans acquired in our purchase of a loan portfolio from the FDIC in July 2014, were deemed purchased credit impaired loans at acquisition. The indemnification asset previously associated with the FDIC loss share agreements related to our failed bank transactions is referred to as the "FDIC receivable." The FDIC receivable was eliminated with the early termination of our loss share agreements discussed below.
 On October 1, 2014, we closed on our acquisition of Atlanta Bancorporation, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary bank, Bank of Atlanta. Atlanta Bancorporation, Inc. was immediately merged into the Company followed by the merger of Bank of Atlanta with and into State Bank. We paid approximately $25.2 million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of Atlanta Bancorporation. With the acquisition of Bank of Atlanta, we acquired one branch in midtown Atlanta and one branch in Duluth, Georgia. Simultaneously with the acquisition, State Bank announced that our existing midtown Atlanta branch would be closed and merged into Bank of Atlanta's midtown Atlanta branch. 
On January 1, 2015, we completed our merger with Georgia-Carolina Bancshares, Inc., the holding company for First Bank of Georgia ("First Bank"). We paid approximately $88.9 million for all of the outstanding shares of Georgia-Carolina Bancshares, Inc. consisting of $31.8 million in cash and $57.0 million of our common stock. Immediately following the merger, First Bank, a Georgia state-chartered bank, became a wholly-owned subsidiary bank of the Company. With the acquisition of First Bank, we acquired three branches in Augusta, Georgia, two branches in Martinez, Georgia, one branch in Evans, Georgia and one branch in Thomson, Georgia. Additionally with the First Bank acquisition, we acquired four mortgage origination offices in Aiken, South Carolina, Augusta, Georgia, Savannah, Georgia and Pooler, Georgia. On July 24, 2015, First Bank merged with and into State Bank.
On May 21, 2015, we entered into an agreement with the FDIC to terminate our loss share agreements for all 12 of our FDIC-assisted acquisitions, resulting in a one-time after-tax charge of approximately $8.9 million, or $14.5 million pre-tax. All rights and obligations of the parties under the FDIC loss share agreements, including the clawback provisions and the settlement of historical loss share expense reimbursement claims, were eliminated under the early termination agreement. All future charge-offs, recoveries, gains, losses and expenses related to assets previously covered by FDIC loss share agreements will now be recognized entirely by us since the FDIC will no longer be sharing in such charge-offs, recoveries, gains, losses and expenses. Despite the termination of the loss share agreements, the terms of the purchase and assumption agreements for our FDIC-assisted acquisitions continue to provide for the FDIC to indemnify us against certain claims, including claims with respect to assets, liabilities or any affiliate not acquired or otherwise assumed by us and with respect to claims based on any action by directors, officers or employees of the failed banks for the term provided in the agreements.
On October 22, 2015, we closed on the acquisition of the equipment finance origination platform of Patriot Capital Corporation ("Patriot Capital"). Patriot Capital, which now operates as a division of State Bank, is a leading provider of equipment financing to the retail petroleum industry. Patriot Capital originates loans throughout the United States. 
On December 31, 2016, we closed on our acquisition of NBG Bancorp, Inc. ("NBG Bancorp") and its wholly-owned subsidiary bank, The National Bank of Georgia ("National Bank of Georgia"). NBG Bancorp was immediately merged into the Company followed by the merger of National Bank of Georgia with and into State Bank. We paid approximately $77.9 million for all of the outstanding shares of NBG Bancorp consisting of $34.2 million in cash and $43.7 million of our common stock. With the acquisition of National Bank of Georgia, we acquired one branch in Athens, Georgia, one branch in Gainesville, Georgia, and a mortgage office in Athens, Georgia.

On December 31, 2016, we also closed on our acquisition of S Bankshares, Inc. ("S Bankshares") and its wholly-owned subsidiary bank, S Bank. S Bankshares was immediately merged into the Company followed by the merger of S Bank with and into State Bank. We paid approximately $12.6 million for all of the outstanding shares of S Bankshares consisting of $4.3 million in cash and $8.3 million of our common stock. With the acquisition of S Bank, we acquired four branches located in Savannah, Glennville, Reidsville and Hinesville, Georgia. 
Strategic Plan
As a result of our 12 FDIC-assisted acquisitions since July 2009, and the fair value discounts associated with each such acquisition, we anticipate that a significant portion of our earnings over the next year or two will continue to be derived from the realization of accretable discounts on the loans that we purchased. (See below "Lending Activities-General" for an explanation of "accretable discounts"). We also plan to continue growing our loan portfolio organically over the coming year and to add additional clients to our cash management and payments business, including our payroll processing services. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had organic loan growth of $316.2 million, or 17.8%, from 2015.
In addition to organic growth, we plan to seek other strategic opportunities, such as acquisitions of select loan portfolios, whole loans and loan participations from correspondent banks and specialty lenders, open bank acquisitions and acquisitions that leverage our expertise in failed bank transactions and distressed debt resolutions. We will also consider the purchase of select lines of business that we believe will complement our existing operations.
To achieve our goals, we have assembled an experienced senior management team, combining extensive market knowledge with an energetic and entrepreneurial culture. The members of our management team have close ties to, and are actively involved in, the communities in which we operate, which is critical to our relationship banking focus. 
Our Market Area
Our primary market areas are Middle Georgia (including Macon), Metropolitan Atlanta, Greater Savannah, Athens, Gainesville and Augusta, Georgia. In addition to our administrative office, located at 3399 Peachtree Road, N.E., Suite 1900, Atlanta, Georgia 30326, at December 31, 2016, we operated 31 full-service banking offices in the following counties in Georgia: Bibb, Chatham, Clarke, Cobb, Columbia, Dooly, Fulton, Gwinnett, Hall, Houston, Jones, Liberty, McDuffie, Richmond and Tattnall. We also operated eight mortgage production offices.

Competition
The banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition in our market areas from many other financial institutions. We offer a competitive suite of products coupled with personalized service. Delivery of customized product sets specifically designed to meet the needs of middle market businesses give us a competitive advantage with our target customers. Competition among financial institutions is based on interest rates offered on deposit accounts, structure, terms and interest rates charged on loans, other credit and service charges relating to loans, the quality and scope of products and services rendered, the convenience of banking facilities, and, in the case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, as well as super-regional, national and international financial institutions that operate in our market areas and elsewhere. In addition, we compete with payroll processing businesses in providing payroll services. 
6

We compete with financial institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. Many of our competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions, such as SunTrust, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and BB&T. These institutions offer some services, such as extensive and established branch networks and more complex financial products, which we do not provide. In addition, many of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive governmental regulations applicable to bank holding companies and federally insured banks such as ours.
Lending Activities
General
We offer a range of lending services, including commercial and residential real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, commercial and industrial loans, agriculture and consumer loans. Our customers are generally individuals, owner-managed businesses, farmers, professionals, real estate investors, home builders, counties and municipalities within our market areas. We also offer equipment finance agreements and certain Small Business Administration loan programs to customers nationally. At December 31, 2016, we had net total loans of $2.8 billion, representing 71.2% of our total earning assets. 
We recorded the loans we acquired in each of our acquisitions at their estimated fair values on the date of each acquisition. We calculated the fair value of loans by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity date of the loan, using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit risk inherent in the loan. We refer to the excess cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value as the "accretable discount." The accretable discount for purchased non-credit impaired loans is recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the loan. The accretable discount for purchased credit impaired loans is recognized as accretion income over the remaining life of the loan. The "nonaccretable discount" is the difference, calculated at acquisition, between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected. We re-estimate our cash flow expectations for purchased credit impaired loans on a quarterly basis, which involves estimates of expected cash flows and significant judgment on timing of loan resolution. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our current allowance for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient, and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio.
        Real Estate Loans
Loans secured by real estate are the principal component of our loan portfolio. Real estate loans are subject to the same general risks as other loans and are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the value of real estate. Increases in interest rates, declines in occupancy rates, fluctuations in the value of real estate, as well as other factors arising after a loan has been made, could negatively affect a borrower's cash flow, creditworthiness and ability to repay the loan. When we make loans, we obtain a security interest in real estate whenever possible, in addition to any other available collateral, to increase the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan. To control concentration risk, we monitor collateral type and industry concentrations within this portfolio.

• | Other Commercial Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2016, other commercial real estate loans amounted to $1.0 billion, or 36.4%, of our loan portfolio. These loans generally have terms of five years or less, although payments may be structured on a longer amortization. We evaluate each loan on an individual basis and attempt to determine the business risks and credit profile of each borrower. 


• | Residential Real Estate Loans. We generally originate and hold certain first mortgage and traditional second mortgage residential real estate loans, adjustable rate mortgages and home equity lines of credit. We also originate fixed and adjustable rate residential real estate loans with terms of up to 30 years for third-party investors. At December 31, 2016, residential real estate loans amounted to $343.4 million, or 12.2%, of our loan portfolio, of which home equity loans totaled $77.9 million, or 22.7%, of the residential real estate loan portfolio. 

7

Real Estate Construction and Development Loans
At December 31, 2016, real estate construction and development loans amounted to $567.8 million, or 20.2%, of our loan portfolio. We offer fixed and adjustable rate residential and commercial construction loans to builders and developers and to consumers who wish to build their own homes. Construction and development loans generally carry a higher degree of risk than long-term financing of existing properties because repayment depends on the ultimate completion of the project and usually on the subsequent leasing and/or sale of the property. Specific risks include:

• | cost overruns;


• | mismanaged construction;


• | inferior or improper construction techniques;


• | economic changes or downturns during construction;


• | a downturn in the real estate market;


• | rising interest rates which may prevent sale of the property; and


• | failure to lease or sell completed projects in a timely manner.

We attempt to reduce the risks associated with construction and development loans by obtaining personal guarantees, as appropriate, monitoring the construction process, and by keeping the loan-to-value ratio of the completed project within regulations as promulgated by both the FDIC and the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance.
We make residential land loans to both commercial entities and consumer borrowers for the purpose of financing land upon which to build a residential home. Residential land loans are reclassified as residential construction loans once construction of the residential home commences. These loans are further categorized as:

• | pre-sold commercial, which is a loan to a commercial entity with a pre-identified buyer for the finished home;


• | owner-occupied consumer, which is a loan to an individual who intends to occupy the finished home; and


• | nonowner-occupied commercial (speculative), which is a loan to a commercial entity intending to lease or sell the finished home.

We make commercial land loans to commercial entities for the purpose of financing land on which to build a commercial project. These loans are for projects that typically involve small-and medium-sized single and multi-use commercial buildings.
We make commercial construction loans to borrowers for the purpose of financing the construction of a commercial development. These loans are further categorized depending on whether the borrower intends (a) to occupy the finished development (owner-occupied) or (b) to lease or sell the finished development (nonowner-occupied). At issuance of the certificate of occupancy these loans are no longer considered construction loans.
Commercial, Financial and Agricultural and Owner-Occupied Real Estate Loans

• | Commercial, Financial and Agricultural. At December 31, 2016, commercial, financial and agricultural loans amounted to $368.1 million, or 13.1%, of our total loan portfolio. We make loans for commercial purposes in various lines of businesses, including the manufacturing, professional service, and crop production industries. Commercial, financial and agricultural loans also includes loans to states and political subdivisions, as well as equipment finance agreements originated through Patriot Capital, a division of State Bank. While these loans may have real estate as partial collateral, many are secured by various other assets of the borrower including but not limited to accounts receivable, inventory, furniture, fixtures, and equipment. Our underwriting and management of the credit take into consideration the fluid nature of receivables and inventory collateral, where appropriate. Our repayment analysis includes a consideration of the cash conversion cycle, historical cash flow coverage, the predictability of future cash flows, together with the overall capitalization of the borrower. We also participate in loan syndications of senior secured commercial loans either directly with the lead bank or through purchases in the secondary market. These loans are primarily to large publicly traded companies throughout the United States and are secured by all assets of the issuing company. These loans are underwritten to the same standards as our organic portfolio. 


• | Owner-Occupied Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2016, owner-occupied real estate loans amounted to $395.9 million, or 14.1%, of our loan portfolio. These loans are underwritten based on the borrower’s ability to service the debt from income from the business, as cash flow from the business is considered the primary source of repayment. 

8

Leases
At December 31, 2016 leases amounted to $71.7 million, or 2.5%, of our loan portfolio. Leases include purchased commercial, business purpose and municipal leases. For purchased leases, the stream of payments and a first security interest in the collateral is assigned to us. Our lease funding is based on a present value of the lease payments at a discounted interest rate, which is determined based on the credit quality of the lessee, the term of the lease compared to expected useful life, and the type of collateral. Types of collateral include, but are not limited to, medical equipment, rolling stock, franchise restaurant equipment and hardware/software. Servicing of purchased leases is primarily retained by the loan originator, as well as ownership of all residuals, if applicable. Lease financing is underwritten by our Specialized Finance Group using similar underwriting standards as would be applied to a secured commercial loan requesting high loan-to-value financing. Risks that are involved with lease financing receivables are credit underwriting and borrower industry concentrations.
Consumer
At December 31, 2016, consumer loans amounted to $42.6 million, or 1.5%, of our loan portfolio. We make a variety of loans to individuals for personal and household purposes, including secured and unsecured installment loans and revolving lines of credit. We underwrite consumer loans based on the borrower's income, current debt level, personal financial statement composition, past credit history and the availability and value of collateral. Consumer loan interest rates are both fixed and variable. Although we typically require monthly payments of interest and a portion of the principal on our loan products, we may offer consumer loans with a single maturity date when a specific source of repayment is available. Consumer loans not secured by real estate are generally considered to have higher risk because they may be unsecured, or, if they are secured, the value of the collateral may be more difficult to assess, more likely to decrease in value, and is more difficult to control, than real estate. During 2015, we began emphasizing the underwriting of consumer loans secured by cash value life insurance policies which presents a lower collateral risk than other non-real estate secured consumer loans. We also purchase pools of retail installment contracts which are underwritten by our Specialized Finance Group. Servicing of purchased retail installment contracts is primarily retained by the loan originator. These loans are underwritten to the same standards as our organic portfolio. 
Loan Approval
Certain credit risks are inherent in making loans. These credit risks include repayment risks, risks resulting from uncertainties in the future value of collateral, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers. We attempt to mitigate repayment risks by adhering to internal credit policies and procedures. We employ consistent analysis and underwriting to examine credit information and prepare underwriting documentation. We monitor and approve exceptions to policy as required, and we also track and address document exceptions.
Our loan approval policy generally provides for all consumer and commercial relationship exposures less than $500,000 to be handled through a centralized underwriting group. We also have specific officer lending limits entrusted to senior sales leadership. Approval concurrence from experienced credit risk managers is required as the size of the transaction increases. Loans underwritten outside of our Centralized Underwriting group are required to be post reported to our Loan Committees. Our Loan Committees include the Enterprise Risk Officer, President of State Bank, Chief Credit Officer, Senior Credit Officer, Regional Credit Officers, Director of Credit Administration, Retail Credit Manager and Director of The Commercial Financial Group. State Bank maintains an internal single borrower lending limit of $20.0 million and no more than $5.0 million may be unsecured. Internal policy has established lending authority up to $40.0 million for any relationship, of which no more than $10.0 million may be unsecured. During Credit Steering Committee meetings all (i) single transaction requests greater than $10.0 million, (ii) non-recourse single transaction requests $5.0 million or greater, (iii) single transaction requests greater than $1.0 million resulting in total credit exposure greater than $20.0 million, or (iv) transaction requests resulting in unsecured total credit exposure of $5.0 million or greater are post reported to our executive officers. 
State Bank maintains a policy not to originate loans to any director, employee (officer or non-officer), or principal shareholder, or the related interests (as defined in Regulation O) of each. This prohibition does not apply to residential mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market to employees not designated as Regulation O officers. Certain of the Acquired Banks previously extended loans from time to time to certain of their directors, their related interests and members of the immediate families of the directors, executive officers and employees of the Acquired Banks. These loans were made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates, collateral and repayment terms, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the Acquired Banks, and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. All loans made to previous Acquired Bank directors or executive officers, their related interests and members of the immediate families of the directors and executive officers who continued in a similar role at State Bank were paid off.

Credit Administration and Loan Review
Organic loans are rated at inception according to our credit grading system. Purchased credit impaired loans and purchased non-credit impaired loans are rated at acquisition date. Purchased non-credit impaired loans are subsequently managed and monitored in the same manner as organic loans. The credit rating for consumer loans and commercial loans with relationship debt less than $500,000 is determined by our Centralized Underwriting group. The credit rating for commercial loans is recommended by the relationship manager and ultimately determined by the applicable approval authority of the loan. It is the responsibility of the relationship manager to assess the accuracy of the credit ratings assigned to relationships with total credit exposure greater than $100,000 on a quarterly basis. The credit rating on loans less than $100,000 will remain unchanged unless the loan is part of a larger relationship or payment issues arise. As such, the primary review mechanism for managing these loans is the past due report. In our quarterly analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses on organic and purchased non-credit impaired loans, loans that are less than $100,000 and are over 60 days past due are reclassified and are treated as substandard and are reserved for as a homogeneous pool, subject to the appropriate loss factor. A reassessment of a loan's credit rating may also be triggered by the noncompliance with financial or reporting covenants, review of financial information, or changes in the primary collateral securing the loan.
Our Credit Administration and Risk Departments assess portfolio trends, concentration risk, and other loan portfolio measurements to gauge the systemic risk that may be inherent in our lending practices and procedures. Our loan review activity is primarily coordinated by the Internal Loan Review Department. Our internal loan review is risk-based, concentrating on those areas with the highest perceived risk. For the year ended December 31, 2016, loans reviewed totaled $1.0 billion, representing 41.0% of recorded investment balances at year-end excluding the loans acquired in our acquisitions of National Bank of Georgia and S Bank. The objective of each review was to assess the accuracy of our internal risk ratings; adherence to applicable regulations and bank policies; documentation exceptions; and potential loan administration deficiencies. 
Lending Limits
Our lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by federal and state law. In general, State Bank is subject to a legal limit on loans to a single borrower equal to 15% of the bank's capital and unimpaired surplus, or 25% if the loan is fully secured. This limit increases or decreases as the bank's capital increases or decreases. Based upon the capitalization of State Bank at December 31, 2016, our legal lending limits were approximately $59.5 million (15%) and $99.2 million (25%), and we maintained a relationship internal lending limit of $10.0 million (if unsecured) and $40.0 million (if secured). We may seek to sell participations in our larger loans to other financial institutions, which will allow us to manage the risk involved in these loans and to meet the lending needs of our customers requiring extensions of credit in excess of these limits. 
Mortgage Banking Activity 
We engage in mortgage banking as part of an overall strategy to deliver fixed and variable rate residential real estate loan products to customers. The loans are primarily originated for sale into the secondary market with servicing released, and are approved for purchase by a third party investor prior to closing. We also operate wholesale lending to facilitate the purchase of loans from qualified brokers and correspondents for resale in the secondary market. We bear minimal interest rate risk on these loans and only hold the loans temporarily until documentation can be completed to finalize the sale to the investor. In addition, we originate and hold certain first mortgage and traditional second mortgage residential real estate loans and adjustable rate mortgages in our residential real estate loan portfolio.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
State Bank Financial Corporation, and our subsidiary bank, State Bank are subject to extensive state and federal banking regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of their operations. These laws generally are intended to protect depositors and not shareholders. The following summary is qualified by reference to the statutory and regulatory provisions discussed. Changes in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects. Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and the policies of various regulatory authorities. We cannot predict the effect that fiscal or monetary policies, economic conditions or new federal or state legislation may have on our business and earnings in the future.
The following discussion is not intended to be a complete list of all of the activities regulated by the banking laws or of the impact of those laws and regulations on our operations. It is intended only to briefly summarize some material provisions.
Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives to Address the Financial Crisis
Although the financial crisis has now passed, two legislative and regulatory responses - the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Basel III-based capital rules - will continue to have an impact on our operations.
11

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
On July 21, 2010, The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was signed into law, which, among other things, changed the oversight and supervision of banks, bank holding companies, and other financial institutions, revised minimum capital requirements, created a new federal agency to regulate consumer financial products and services and implemented changes to corporate governance and compensation practices. Several provisions affect us, including:

• | Deposit Insurance Modifications. The Dodd-Frank Act modified the FDIC's assessment base upon which deposit insurance premiums are calculated. The new assessment base equals our average total consolidated assets minus the sum of our average tangible equity during the assessment period. The FDIC has continued to modify some of the rules on assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently raised the standard maximum federal deposit insurance limits from $100,000 to $250,000. 


• | Creation of New Governmental Authorities. The Dodd-Frank Act created various new governmental authorities such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), an independent regulatory authority housed within the Federal Reserve. The CFPB has broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products. The CFPB officially came into being on July 21, 2011, and rulemaking authority for a range of consumer financial protection laws (such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, among others) transferred from the Federal Reserve and other federal regulators to the CFPB on that date. The act gives the CFPB authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets for compliance with these federal consumer laws. The authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with $10 billion or less in assets for compliance with federal consumer laws will remain largely with those institutions’ primary regulators. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations of these smaller institutions on a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. The CFPB may participate in examinations of our subsidiary bank, which currently has assets of less than $10 billion, and could supervise and examine our other direct or indirect subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products or services. In addition, the act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than the regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB against certain institutions. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. Under the act, financial institutions may not make a residential mortgage loan unless they make a “reasonable and good faith determination” that the consumer has a “reasonable ability” to repay the loan. The act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure but provides a full or partial safe harbor from such defenses for loans that are “qualified mortgages.” CFPB rules now in effect specify the types of income and assets that may be considered in the ability-to-repay determination, the permissible sources for verification, and the required methods of calculating a loan’s monthly payments. The rules also extend the requirement that creditors verify and document a borrower’s income and assets to include all information that creditors rely on in determining repayment ability. The rules also define “qualified mortgages,” imposing both underwriting standards - for example, a borrower’s debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43% - and limits on the terms of such loans. Points and fees are subject to a relatively stringent cap, and payments that may be made in the course of closing a loan are limited as well. Certain loans, including interest-only loans and negative amortization loans, cannot be qualified mortgages.

• | Executive Compensation and Corporate Governance Requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies, including the Company. The Dodd-Frank Act (1) grants shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation; (2) enhances independence requirements for compensation committee members; (3) requires the SEC to adopt rules directing national securities exchanges to establish listing standards requiring all listed companies to adopt incentive-based compensation clawback policies for executive officers; and (4) provides the SEC with authority to adopt proxy access rules that would allow shareholders of publicly traded companies to nominate candidates for election as a director and have those nominees included in a company's proxy materials. The SEC has completed the bulk (although not all) of the rulemaking necessary to implement these provisions. 

12

Separately, the Dodd-Frank Act requires several federal agencies, including the banking agencies and the SEC, to jointly issue a rule restricting incentive compensation arrangements at financial institutions, including bank holding companies and banks. The agencies proposed a rule in 2011, which was replaced with a new proposed rule in May 2016, but the rule has not yet been finalized.
Basel Capital Standards
Regulatory capital rules released in July 2013 to implement capital standards referred to as Basel III and developed by an international body known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, impose higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with more than $1 billion in total consolidated assets. More stringent requirements are imposed on “advanced approaches” banking organizations-those organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures, or that have opted in to the Basel II capital regime. The requirements in the rule began to phase in on January 1, 2015 for us. The requirements in the rule will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019.
The rule includes certain new and higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously in place. Specifically, the following minimum capital requirements apply to us:

• | a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;


• | a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the former 4% requirement);


• | a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from the former requirement); and


• | a leverage ratio of 4% (also unchanged from the former requirement).

Under the rule, Tier 1 capital is redefined to include two components: Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that currently qualify in Tier 2 capital plus instruments that the rule has disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock, formerly includable in Tier 1 capital, is now included only in Tier 2 capital. Accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") is presumptively included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. The rule provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. We made this opt-out election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of our investment securities portfolio.

In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally over time, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019, and will consist of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. As of January 1, 2017, we are required to hold a capital conservation buffer of 1.25%, increasing by 0.625% each successive year until 2019.
In general, the rules have had the effect of increasing capital requirements by increasing the risk weights on certain assets, including high volatility commercial real estate, certain loans past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status, mortgage servicing rights not includable in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, equity exposures, and claims on securities firms, that are used in the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios.
13

Volcker Rule
Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the “Volcker Rule,” prohibits any bank, bank holding company, or affiliate (referred to collectively as “banking entities”) from engaging in two types of activities: “proprietary trading” and the ownership or sponsorship of private equity or hedge funds that are referred to as “covered funds.” Proprietary trading is, in general, trading in securities on a short-term basis for a banking entity's own account. Funds subject to the ownership and sponsorship prohibition are those not required to register with the SEC because they have only accredited investors or no more than 100 investors. In 2013, the federal banking agencies together with the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, issued the final Volcker Rule regulations. The Volcker rule does not have a material effect on our operations as we do not engage in proprietary trading or own or sponsor covered funds.  The Company may incur costs to adopt additional policies and systems to ensure compliance with the Volcker Rule, but any such costs are not expected to be material.
State Bank Financial Corporation
We own 100% of the outstanding capital stock of State Bank, and therefore we are required to be registered as a bank holding company under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "Bank Holding Company Act"). As a result, we are primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the "Federal Reserve") under the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations promulgated under it. As a bank holding company located in Georgia, the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance also regulates and monitors our operations.
Permitted Activities
Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in, the following activities:

• | banking or managing or controlling banks;


• | furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries; and


• | any activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking.

Activities that the Federal Reserve has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include:

• | factoring accounts receivable;


• | making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities;


• | leasing personal or real property;


• | operating a nonbank depository institution, such as a savings association;


• | trust company functions;


• | financial and investment advisory activities;


• | conducting discount securities brokerage activities;


• | underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments;


• | providing specified management consulting and counseling activities;


• | performing selected data processing services and support services;


• | acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions; and


• | performing selected insurance underwriting activities.

14

Our only subsidiary is State Bank. Additionally, we do not currently engage in other activities other than the management and control of State Bank, although we may choose to engage in other activities in the future. As a bank holding company, we also can elect to be treated as a "financial holding company," which would allow us to engage in a broader array of activities. In sum, a financial holding company can engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to financial activities, including insurance underwriting, sales and brokerage activities, providing financial and investment advisory services and underwriting services, and engaging in limited merchant banking activities. We have not sought financial holding company status, but we may elect that status in the future as our business matures. If we were to elect in writing for financial holding company status, we would be required to be well capitalized and well managed, and each insured depository institution we control would also have to be well capitalized, well managed and have at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (discussed below).
The Federal Reserve has the authority to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company's continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries.
Change in Control
Two statutes, the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with regulations promulgated under them, require some form of regulatory review before any company acquires “control” of a bank or a bank holding company. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, control is deemed to exist if a company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company; controls the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors; or exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of a bank or bank holding company. In guidance issued in 2008, the Federal Reserve has stated that it would not expect control to exist if a person acquires, in aggregate, less than 33% of the total equity of a bank or bank holding company (voting and nonvoting equity), provided such person’s ownership does not include 15% or more of any class of voting securities. Prior Federal Reserve approval is necessary before an entity acquires sufficient control to become a bank holding company. Natural persons, certain non-business trusts, and other entities are not treated as companies (or bank holding companies), and their acquisitions are not subject to review under the Bank Holding Company Act. State laws generally, including Georgia law, require state approval before an acquirer may become the holding company of a state bank.
Under the Change in Bank Control Act, a person or company is required to file a notice with the Federal Reserve if it will, as a result of the transaction, own or control 10% or more of any class of voting securities or direct the management or policies of a bank or bank holding company and either if the bank or bank holding company has registered securities or if the acquirer would be the largest holder of that class of voting securities after the acquisition. For a change in control at the holding company level, both the Federal Reserve and the subsidiary bank's primary federal regulator must approve the change in control; at the bank level, only the bank's primary federal regulator is involved. Transactions subject to the Bank Holding Company Act are exempt from Change in Control Act requirements. For state banks, state laws, including that of Georgia, typically require approval by the state bank regulator as well.
Source of Strength
The Dodd-Frank Act confirmed a longstanding Federal Reserve policy that a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support the bank in circumstances in which the bank holding company might not otherwise do so. If State Bank was to become "undercapitalized," we would be required to provide a guarantee of the Bank's plan to return to capital adequacy. (See "Bank Regulation-Prompt Corrective Action" below.) Additionally, under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary, other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank, upon the Federal Reserve's determination that the activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any depository institution subsidiary of the bank holding company. Federal bank regulatory authorities have additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or nonbank subsidiaries if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution's financial condition. Further, any loans by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank at a certain level would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority payment.
15

Dividends and Capital Requirements
The Federal Reserve imposes certain capital requirements on bank holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act, including a minimum leverage ratio and minimum ratios of capital to risk-weighted assets. These requirements are essentially the same as those that apply to State Bank and are described above under “Basel Capital Standards” and below under "Bank Regulation-Prompt Corrective Action." Subject to our capital requirements and certain other restrictions, including the consent of the Federal Reserve, we are able to borrow money to make capital contributions to State Bank, and these loans may be repaid from dividends paid from State Bank to the Company. 
Our ability to pay dividends depends on State Bank's ability to pay dividends to us, which is subject to regulatory restrictions as described below in "Bank Regulation-Dividends." The Federal Reserve imposes limits on dividends paid by a bank holding company, but because we have no operations apart from management of State Bank, the bank-level restrictions dictate our ability to make capital distributions. We are also able to raise capital for contribution to State Bank by issuing securities without having to receive regulatory approval, subject to compliance with federal and state securities laws. 
Bank Regulation
State Bank operates as a state bank incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia and is subject to examination by the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance and the FDIC. The deposits of State Bank are insured by the FDIC up to a maximum amount of $250,000.
The Georgia Department of Banking and Finance and the FDIC regulate or monitor virtually all areas of State Bank's operations, including:

• | security devices and procedures;


• | adequacy of capitalization and loss reserves;


• | loans;


• | investments;


• | borrowings;


• | deposits;


• | mergers;


• | issuances of securities;


• | payment of dividends;


• | interest rates payable on deposits;


• | interest rates or fees chargeable on loans;


• | establishment of branches;


• | corporate reorganizations;


• | maintenance of books and records; and


• | adequacy of staff training to carry on safe lending and deposit gathering practices.

These agencies and the federal and state laws applicable to State Bank’s operations extensively regulate various aspects of our banking business, including, among other things, permissible types and amounts of loans, investments and other activities, capital adequacy, branching, interest rates on loans and on deposits, the maintenance of reserves on demand deposit liabilities, and the safety and soundness of our banking practices.
All insured depository institutions must undergo regular on-site examinations by their appropriate banking agency. The cost of examinations of insured depository institutions and any affiliates may be assessed by the appropriate agency against each institution or affiliate as it deems necessary or appropriate. Insured depository institutions file quarterly call reports with their federal regulatory agency and their state supervisor, when applicable. The FDIC has developed a method for insured depository institutions to provide supplemental disclosure of the estimated fair market value of assets and liabilities, to the extent feasible and practicable, in any balance sheet, financial statement, report of condition or any other report of any insured depository institution. The FDIC and the other federal banking regulatory agencies also have issued standards for all insured depository institutions relating, among other things, to the following:
16


• | internal controls;


• | information systems and audit systems;


• | loan documentation;


• | credit underwriting;


• | interest rate risk exposure; and


• | asset quality.

Prompt Corrective Action
As an insured depository institution, State Bank is required to comply with the capital requirements promulgated under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the regulations under it, which set forth five capital categories, each with specific regulatory consequences. The following is a list of the criteria for each prompt corrective action category:

• | Well Capitalized - The institution exceeds the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. A well capitalized institution:


• | has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater; and


• | has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater; and


• | has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater; and


• | has a leverage capital ratio of 5% or greater; and


• | is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.


• | Adequately Capitalized - The institution meets the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. The institution may not make a capital distribution if it would result in the institution becoming undercapitalized. An adequately capitalized institution:


• | has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater; and


• | has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater; and


• | has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater; and


• | has a leverage capital ratio of 4% or greater.


• | Undercapitalized - The institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. An undercapitalized institution:


• | has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%; or


• | has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%; or


• | has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5% or greater; or


• | has a leverage capital ratio of less than 4%.


• | Significantly Undercapitalized - The institution is significantly below the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. A significantly undercapitalized institution:


• | has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%; or


• | has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%; or


• | has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or greater; or


• | has a leverage capital ratio of less than 3%.


• | Critically Undercapitalized - The institution fails to meet a critical capital level set by the appropriate federal banking agency. A critically undercapitalized institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.

17

If the FDIC determines, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition, the FDIC is authorized to reclassify the institution to the next lower capital category (other than critically undercapitalized) and require the submission of a plan to correct the unsafe or unsound condition.
If the institution is not well capitalized, it cannot accept brokered deposits without prior FDIC approval. Even if approved, the rates the institution may pay on the brokered deposits will be limited. In addition, a bank that is undercapitalized cannot offer an effective yield in excess of 75 basis points over the "national rate" paid on deposits (including brokered deposits, if approval is granted for the bank to accept them) of comparable size and maturity. The "national rate" is defined as a simple average of rates paid by insured depository institutions and branches for which data are available and is published weekly by the FDIC. Institutions subject to the restrictions that believe they are operating in an area where the rates paid on deposits are higher than the "national rate" can use the local market to determine the prevailing rate if they seek and receive a determination from the FDIC that it is operating in a high-rate area. Regardless of the determination, institutions must use the national rate to determine conformance for all deposits outside their market areas.
Moreover, if the institution becomes less than adequately capitalized, it must adopt a capital restoration plan acceptable to the FDIC. The institution also would become subject to increased regulatory oversight, and is increasingly restricted in the scope of its permissible activities. Each company having control over an undercapitalized institution also must provide a limited guarantee that the institution will comply with its capital restoration plan. Except under limited circumstances consistent with an accepted capital restoration plan, an undercapitalized institution may not grow. An undercapitalized institution may not acquire another institution, establish additional branch offices or engage in any new line of business unless it is determined by the appropriate federal banking agency to be consistent with an accepted capital restoration plan, or unless the FDIC determines that the proposed action will further the purpose of prompt corrective action. The appropriate federal banking agency may take any action authorized for a significantly undercapitalized institution if an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails in any material respect to implement a plan accepted by the agency. A critically undercapitalized institution is subject to having a receiver or conservator appointed to manage its affairs and the loss of its charter to conduct banking activities.
An insured depository institution may not pay a management fee to a bank holding company controlling that institution or any other person having control of the institution if, after making the payment, the institution would be undercapitalized. In addition, an institution cannot make a capital distribution, such as a dividend or other distribution that is in substance a distribution of capital, to the owners of the institution if following such a distribution the institution would be undercapitalized.
At December 31, 2016, State Bank's regulatory capital surpassed the levels required to be considered "well capitalized."
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from State Bank. Various legal limitations restrict State Bank from lending or otherwise supplying funds to the Company or its nonbank subsidiaries, if any. The Company and State Bank are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation W. 
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act places limits on the amount of loans or extensions of credit by a bank to any affiliate, including its holding company, and on a bank's investments in, or certain other transactions with, affiliates and on the amount of advances by a bank to third parties that are collateralized by the securities or obligations of any affiliates of the bank. Section 23A also applies to derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions that cause a bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate. The aggregate of all covered transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of State Bank's capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of State Bank's capital and surplus. Furthermore, within the foregoing limitations as to amount, each extension of credit or certain other credit exposures must meet specified collateral requirements. These limits apply to any transaction with a third party if the proceeds of the transaction benefit an affiliate of a bank. State Bank is forbidden to purchase low quality assets from an affiliate.
Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, among other things, prohibits a bank from engaging in certain transactions with certain affiliates unless the transactions are on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to such bank or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated companies. If there are no comparable transactions, a bank’s (or one of its subsidiaries’) affiliate transaction must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to, or would apply to, nonaffiliated companies. These requirements apply to all transactions subject to Section 23A as well as to certain other transactions.
18

The affiliates of a bank include any holding company of the bank, any other company under common control with the bank (including any company controlled by the same shareholders who control the bank), any subsidiary of the bank that is itself a bank, any company in which the majority of the directors or trustees also constitute a majority of the directors or trustees of the bank or holding company of the bank, any company sponsored and advised on a contractual basis by the bank or an affiliate, and any mutual fund advised by a bank or any of the bank's affiliates. Regulation W generally excludes all nonbank subsidiaries of banks from treatment as affiliates, except for subsidiaries engaged in certain nonbank financial activities or to the extent that the Federal Reserve decides to treat these subsidiaries as affiliates. 
State Bank is also subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, certain principal shareholders, and their related interests. Extensions of credit include derivative transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions to the extent that such transactions cause a bank to have credit exposure to an insider. Any extension of credit to an insider:

• | must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties; and


• | must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.

In some circumstances, approval of an extension of credit to an insider must be approved by a majority of the disinterested directors. Extensions of credit to any one insider are capped at 10% of a bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, with an additional 10% for loans secured by readily marketable collateral. Extensions of credit to all insiders are capped at 100% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. State Bank has a policy not to extend credit to its employees, directors, certain principal shareholders and their related interests.
In addition, State Bank may not purchase an asset from or sell an asset to an insider unless the transaction is on market terms and, if representing more than 10% of capital, is approved in advance by the majority of disinterested directors.
Branching
Under current Georgia and federal law, we may open branch offices throughout Georgia with the prior approval of the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance and the FDIC. In addition, with prior regulatory approval, we will be able to acquire branches of existing banks located in Georgia. Furthermore, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes a state or national bank to branch into any state as if they were chartered in that state. 
Anti-Tying Restrictions
Under amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act and Federal Reserve regulations, a bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers. In general, a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property, or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these on the condition that:

• | the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or services from or to the bank, the bank holding company or its subsidiaries; or


• | the customer may not obtain some other credit, property, or services from a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to ensure the soundness of the credit extended.

Certain arrangements are permissible: a bank may offer combined-balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products, and certain foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule. A bank holding company or any bank affiliate also is subject to anti-tying requirements in connection with electronic benefit transfer services.
19

Community Reinvestment Act
The Community Reinvestment Act requires a financial institution's primary regulator, which is the FDIC for State Bank, to evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of the communities within the institution's assessment area, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and individuals. This record is considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately address the needs for bank products and services in low- and moderate-income communities and by low- and moderate-income individuals could result in the imposition of additional requirements and limitations on the institution. Additionally, the institution must publicly disclose the terms of various Community Reinvestment Act-related agreements. In its most recent CRA examination, State Bank was rated Satisfactory.
Financial Subsidiaries
Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the "GLBA"), subject to certain conditions imposed by their respective banking regulators, national and state-chartered banks are permitted to form "financial subsidiaries" that may conduct financial or incidental activities, thereby permitting bank subsidiaries to engage in certain activities that previously were impermissible. The GLBA imposes several safeguards and restrictions on financial subsidiaries, including that the parent bank's equity investment in the financial subsidiary be deducted from the bank's assets and tangible equity for purposes of calculating the bank's capital adequacy. In addition, the GLBA imposes restrictions on transactions between a bank and its financial subsidiaries similar to restrictions applicable to transactions between banks and nonbank affiliates. State Bank has no financial subsidiaries
Consumer Protection Regulations
Activities of State Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by State Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The loan operations of State Bank are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as:

• | the Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, governing disclosures of credit and servicing terms to consumer borrowers and including substantial new requirements for mortgage lending and servicing, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act;


• | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 and Regulation C, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the communities they serve;


• | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, or other prohibited factors in extending credit;


• | the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and Regulation V, as well as the rules and regulations of the FDIC governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies, certain identity theft protections and certain credit and other disclosures;


• | the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Regulation F, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and


• | the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, which governs aspects of the settlement process for residential mortgage loans.

The deposit operations of State Bank are also subject to federal laws, such as:

• | the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which, among other things, limits the amount of deposit insurance available per account to $250,000 and imposes other limits on deposit-taking;


• | the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;


• | the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers' rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and


• | the Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, which requires depository institutions to provide disclosures so that consumers can make meaningful comparisons about depository institutions and accounts.

Enforcement Powers
State Bank and its respective "institution-affiliated parties," including its respective managements, employees, agents, independent contractors and consultants, such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution's affairs, are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law, regulations or written orders of a government agency. These practices can include the failure of an institution to timely file required reports or the filing of false or misleading information or the submission of inaccurate reports. Civil penalties may be as high as $1,375,000 a day for certain violations. Criminal penalties for some financial institution crimes have been increased to 20 years. 
In addition, regulators have considerable flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution-affiliated parties. Possible enforcement actions include the termination of deposit insurance. Furthermore, banking agencies have expansive power to issue cease-and-desist orders. These orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts or take other actions as determined by the ordering agency to be appropriate.
The number of government entities authorized to take action against State Bank has expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC continues to have primary enforcement authority. The CFPB has back-up enforcement authority with respect to the consumer protection statutes above. Specifically, the CFPB may request reports from and conduct limited examinations of State Bank in conducting investigations involving the consumer protection statutes. Further, state attorneys general may bring civil actions or other proceedings under the Dodd-Frank Act or regulations against state-chartered banks, including State Bank. Prior notice to the CFPB and the FDIC would be necessary for a state civil action against State Bank.
Anti-Money Laundering
Financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs governed by the Bank Secrecy Act, that include established internal policies, procedures and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. Financial institutions are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and "knowing your customer" in their dealings with foreign financial institutions, foreign customers and other high risk customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions. Recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks. Anti-money laundering obligations have been substantially strengthened as a result of the USA PATRIOT Act, enacted in 2001 and renewed through 2019, as described below. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required immediately to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications. In recent years, several merger and acquisition transactions have been held up because of regulatory concerns about compliance with anti-money laundering requirements. The regulatory authorities have been active in imposing "cease and desist" orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions that have not complied with these requirements.
USA PATRIOT Act
The USA PATRIOT Act became effective on October 26, 2001, and amended the Bank Secrecy Act. The USA PATRIOT Act provides, in part, for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering by enhancing anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, as well as enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanisms for the U.S. government, including:

• | standards for verifying customer identification at account opening;


• | rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering;


• | reports of nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for transactions exceeding $10,000; and


• | filing suspicious activities reports by brokers and dealers if they believe a customer may be violating U.S. laws and regulations.

21

The USA PATRIOT Act requires financial institutions to undertake enhanced due diligence of private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons that they administer, maintain or manage. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications.
Under the USA PATRIOT Act, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) can send State Bank lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities or money laundering. State Bank may be requested to search its records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists. If State Bank identifies any such relationships or transactions, it must report those relationships or transactions to FinCEN.
The Office of Foreign Assets Control
The Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), which is an office in the U.S. Department of the Treasury, is responsible for helping to ensure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with "enemies" of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts. If a bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze or block the transaction on the account. State Bank has appointed an OFAC compliance officer to oversee the inspection of its accounts and the filing of any notifications. State Bank actively checks high-risk OFAC areas such as new accounts, wire transfers and customer files. These checks are performed using software that is updated each time a modification is made to the lists provided by OFAC and other agencies of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.
Privacy, Data Security and Credit Reporting
Financial institutions are required to protect the confidentiality of the nonpublic personal information of individual customers and to disclose their policies for doing so. Customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except under narrow circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly sponsoring a product or service with a nonaffiliated third party. Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. State Bank's policy is not to disclose any personal information unless permitted by law.
Recent cyber attacks against banks and other institutions that resulted in unauthorized access to confidential customer information have prompted the Federal banking agencies to issue several warnings and extensive guidance on cyber security. The agencies are likely to devote more resources to this part of their safety and soundness examination than they have in the past.
Like other lending institutions, State Bank uses credit bureau data in its underwriting activities. Use of that data is regulated under the Federal Credit Reporting Act on a uniform, nationwide basis. The act and its implementing regulation, Regulation V, cover credit reporting, prescreening, sharing of information between affiliates, and the use of credit data. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 allows states to enact identity theft laws that are not inconsistent with the conduct required by the provisions of the act. 
Payment of Dividends
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary, State Bank. While there are various legal and regulatory limitations under federal and state law on the extent to which State Bank can pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to the Company, the principal source of the Company's cash revenues is dividends from State Bank. The relevant federal and state regulatory agencies also have authority to prohibit a bank or bank holding company, which would include the Company and State Bank, from engaging in what, in the opinion of the regulatory body, constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business. The payment of dividends could, depending upon the financial condition of the subsidiary, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business.
22

Under Georgia law, the prior approval of the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance is required before any cash dividends may be paid by a state bank if:

• | total classified assets at the most recent examination of the bank exceed 80% of the equity capital (as defined, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses) of the bank;


• | the aggregate amount of dividends declared or anticipated to be declared in the calendar year exceeds 50% of the net profits (as defined) for the previous calendar year; and


• | the ratio of equity capital to adjusted total assets is less than 6%.

Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies
Our earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary policies of the United States Government and its agencies. The Federal Open Market Committee's monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important effect on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have major effects on the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its open market operations in United States government securities and through its regulation of the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits. We cannot predict the nature or effect of future changes in monetary policies. In December 2016, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, and indicated the potential for further gradual increases in the federal funds rate depending on the economic outlook.
Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC
The deposits of State Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. The Dodd Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings associations and credit unions to $250,000 per account. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the insurance fund.
FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay a Financing Corporation assessment to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the 1980s. These assessments, which may be revised based upon the level of deposits, will continue until the bonds mature in the years 2017 through 2019.
The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines after a notice and hearing that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, remain insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC.
Limitations on Incentive Compensation
In June 2010, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization's incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization's ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors.
23

The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not "large, complex banking organizations." These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization's activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization's supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization's ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization's safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
The Dodd-Frank Act required the federal banking agencies, the SEC, and certain other federal agencies to jointly issue a regulation on incentive compensation. The agencies proposed such a rule in 2011, which reflected the 2010 guidance. However, the 2011 proposal was replaced with a new proposed rule in May 2016, which makes explicit that the involvement of risk management and control personnel includes not only compliance, risk management and internal audit, but also legal, human resources, accounting, financial reporting, and finance roles responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring or controlling risk-taking. A final rule had not been adopted as of December 31, 2016.
Proposed Legislation and Regulatory Action
New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide-ranging provisions for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of the nation's financial institutions. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute.
