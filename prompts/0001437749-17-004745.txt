ITEM 1. Business
GENERAL BUSINESS
 Our Company
 
GulfMark Offshore, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 1996. We provide offshore marine support and transportation services primarily to companies involved in the offshore exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Our vessels transport materials, supplies and personnel to offshore facilities, and also move and position drilling and production facilities. The majority of our operations are conducted in the North Sea, offshore Southeast Asia and offshore the Americas. We currently operate a fleet of 69 owned or managed offshore supply vessels, or OSVs, in the following regions: 28 vessels in the North Sea, 10 vessels offshore Southeast Asia, and 31 vessels offshore the Americas. Our fleet is one of the world’s youngest, largest and most geographically balanced, high specification OSV fleets. Our owned vessels have an average age of approximately ten years. 
 
We have three operating segments: the North Sea, Southeast Asia and the Americas. Our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial information about each of these operating segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate our performance. Our operations within each of these geographic regions have similar economic characteristics, services, distribution methods and regulatory concerns. All of the operating segments are considered reportable segments under Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, No. 280, “Segment Reporting,” or ASC 280. For financial information about our operating segments and geographic areas, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Segment Results” included in Part II, Item 7, and Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.

Offshore Marine Services Industry Overview
 
We utilize our vessels to provide services to our customers supporting the construction, positioning and ongoing operation of offshore oil and natural gas drilling rigs and platforms and related infrastructure, and substantially all of our revenue is derived from providing these services. The offshore marine services industry employs various types of OSVs that are used to transport materials, supplies and personnel, and to move and position drilling and production facilities. Offshore marine service providers are employed by companies that are engaged in the offshore exploration and production of oil and natural gas and related services. Services provided by companies in this industry are performed in numerous locations worldwide. The major markets that employ a large number of vessels include the North Sea, offshore Southeast Asia, offshore West Africa, offshore the Middle East, offshore Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. Vessel usage is also significant in other international markets, including offshore India, offshore Australia, offshore Trinidad, the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean Sea, offshore Russia and offshore East Africa. The industry is fragmented with many multi-national and regional competitors. 
 
Our business is directly impacted by the level of activity in worldwide offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, which in turn is influenced by trends in oil and natural gas prices. In addition, oil and natural gas prices are affected by a host of geopolitical and economic forces, including the fundamental principles of supply and demand. In particular, the oil price is significantly influenced by actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC. Beginning in late 2014, the oil and gas industry experienced a significant decline in the price of oil causing an industry-wide downturn that continued into 2017. The decline was in part a result of an OPEC decision to increase production. The price of oil declined significantly from over $100 per barrel in July 2014 to below $30 per barrel in February 2016. The downturn of the last few years has significantly impacted the operational plans for oil companies, resulting in reduced expenditures for exploration and production activities, and consequently has adversely affected the drilling and support service sector. These changes in industry dynamics decreased demand for OSV services and led to an excess number of vessels in all of our operating regions. Although OPEC met in November 2016 and agreed to limit production going forward, day rates have not recovered. In many regions, day rates for OSV services have fallen below the levels needed to sustain our business. Assuming the industry cost structure remains at current levels, many industry observers believe that sustained oil price levels in excess of $60 per barrel are required to return the OSV business to profitability.

The characteristics and current marketing environment in each operating segment are discussed below in greater detail. Each of the major geographic offshore oil and natural gas production regions has unique characteristics that influence the economics of exploration and production and, consequently, the market demand for vessels in support of these activities. While there is some vessel interchangeability between geographic regions, barriers such as mobilization costs, vessel suitability and cabotage restrict migration of some vessels between regions. This is most notable in the North Sea, where vessel design requirements dictated by the harsh operating environment may restrict relocation of vessels into that market and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where entry into the market is subject to the Jones Act restrictions. Conversely, these same design characteristics make North Sea capable vessels unsuitable for other areas where draft restrictions and, to a lesser degree, higher operating costs, restrict migration. 
 
WORLDWIDE FLEET
 
In addition to the vessels we own, we manage vessels for third-party owners, providing support services ranging from chartering assistance to full operational management. Although these managed vessels provide limited direct financial contribution, the added market presence can provide a competitive advantage for the manager. In addition, as a result of the industry downturn, we have removed some vessels from active service (also called stacking) to preserve cash flow. The following table summarizes our overall owned, managed and total fleet changes since December 31, 2015 and our stacked vessels as of March 16, 2017:

Vessel Classifications
 
OSVs generally fall into one or more of seven functional classifications derived from their primary or predominant operating characteristics or capabilities. These classifications are not rigid, however, and it is not unusual for a vessel to fit into more than one of the categories. These functional classifications are:

● | Anchor Handling, Towing and Support Vessels, or AHTSs, are used to set anchors for drilling rigs and to tow mobile drilling rigs and equipment from one location to another. In addition, these vessels typically can be used in supply roles when they are not performing anchor handling and towing services. They are characterized by shorter aft decks and special equipment such as towing winches. Vessels of this type with less than 10,000 brake horsepower, or BHP, are referred to as small AHTSs, or SmAHTSs, while AHTSs in excess of 10,000 BHP are referred to as large AHTSs, or LgAHTSs. The most powerful North Sea class AHTSs have up to 25,000 BHP. All of our AHTSs can also function as platform supply vessels.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Platform Supply Vessels, or PSVs, serve drilling and production facilities and support offshore construction and maintenance work. They are differentiated from other OSVs by their cargo handling capabilities, particularly their large capacity and versatility. PSVs utilize space on deck and below deck and are used to transport supplies such as fuel, water, drilling fluids, equipment and provisions. PSVs typically range in size from 150 to 300 feet. Large PSVs, or LgPSVs, generally range from 210 to 300 feet in length, with a few vessels somewhat larger, and are particularly suited for supporting large concentrations of offshore production locations because of their large, clear after deck and below deck capacities. The majority of the LgPSVs we operate function primarily in this classification but are also capable of servicing construction support.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fast Supply or Crew Vessels, or FSVs or crewboats, transport personnel and cargo to and from production platforms and rigs. Older crewboats (early 1980s build or earlier) are typically 100 to 120 feet in length, and are designed for speed and to transport personnel. Newer crewboat designs are generally larger, 130 to 185 feet in length, and can be longer with greater cargo carrying capacities. Vessels in the larger category are also called fast supply vessels. They are used primarily to transport cargo on a time-sensitive basis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Specialty Vessels, or SpVs, generally have special features to meet the requirements of specific jobs. The special features can include large deck spaces, high electrical generating capacities, slow controlled speed and varied propulsion thruster configurations, extra berthing facilities and long-range capabilities. These vessels are primarily used to support floating production storing and offloading; diving operations; remotely operated vehicles; survey operations and seismic data gathering; as well as oil recovery, oil spill response and well stimulation. Some of our owned vessels frequently provide specialty functions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Standby Rescue Vessels perform a safety patrol function for a particular area and are required for all manned locations in the North Sea and in some other locations where oil and natural gas exploitation occurs. These vessels typically remain on station to provide a safety backup to offshore rigs and production facilities and carry special equipment to rescue personnel. They are equipped to provide first aid, shelter and, in some cases, function as support vessels.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Construction Support Vessels are vessels such as pipe-laying barges, diving support vessels or specially designed vessels, such as pipe carriers, used to transport the large cargos of material and supplies required to support the construction and installation of offshore platforms and pipelines. A large number of our LgPSVs also function as pipe carriers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Utility Vessels are typically 90 to 150 feet in length and are used to provide limited crew transportation, some transportation of oilfield support equipment and, in some locations, standby functions.

Vessel Construction, Acquisitions and Divestitures
 
During 2016, we sold one older vessel from our North Sea fleet and three vessels from our Southeast Asia fleet for combined proceeds of $6.5 million. The sales of these vessels generated a combined loss on sales of assets of $8.6 million. In March 2017, we sold two of our fast supply vessels and will record a first quarter 2017 combined loss on sales of assets of $5.3 million. 
 
At December 31, 2015, we had two vessels under construction in the U.S. that were significantly delayed. In March 2016, we resolved certain matters under dispute with the shipbuilder and reset the contract schedules so that we would take delivery of the first vessel in mid-2016 and the second vessel in mid-2017, at which time a final payment of $26.0 million would be due. We took delivery of the first of these vessels during the second quarter of 2016. Under the settlement, we can elect not to take delivery of the second vessel and forego the final payment, in which case the shipbuilder will retain the vessel.
 
We had a vessel under construction in Norway that was scheduled to be completed and delivered during the first quarter of 2016; however, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we amended our contract with the shipbuilder to delay delivery of the vessel until January 2017. Concurrently, in order to delay the payment of a substantial portion of the construction costs, we agreed to pay monthly installments through May 2016 totaling 92.2 million NOK (or approximately $11.0 million) and to pay a final installment on delivery in January 2017 of 195.0 million NOK (or approximately $23.3 million at delivery). We paid such final installment and took delivery of this vessel in January 2017.

Maintenance of Our Vessels and Drydocking Obligations
 
In addition to repairs, we are required to make expenditures for the certification and maintenance of our actively marketed vessels, and those expenditures typically increase with the age of the vessels. We have determined that generally we will not maintain stacked vessels in class until they are likely to achieve positive cash flow in a return to market. However, we will determine the need to perform drydocks in some circumstances such as the ability to easily maintain class or a potential sale. The deferred drydocks will eventually be required prior to returning the vessels to active service. The demands of the market, management judgment as to which vessels to market and which vessels to stack, the expiration of existing contracts, the commencement of new contracts, and customer preferences influence the timing of drydocks. Our drydocking expenditures for 11 drydocks in 2016 totaled $4.7 million. Future drydock costs will depend on vessel activity and vessel class requirements.

Market and Segment Overview
 
We define the North Sea market as offshore Norway, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Faeroe Islands, Greenland and the Barents Sea. Historically, this market has been the most demanding of all exploration frontiers due to harsh weather, erratic sea conditions, significant water depth and some long sailing distances. Exploration and production operators in the North Sea market have typically been large and well-capitalized entities (major and state-owned oil and natural gas companies and large independents) in large part because of the significant financial commitment required. Projects in the North Sea tend to be large in scope with long planning horizons. As a result, vessel demand in the North Sea has historically been more stable and less susceptible to abrupt swings than in other regions. 
 
The North Sea market can be broadly divided into three service segments: exploration support; production platform support; and field development and construction (which includes subsea services). The exploration support services market represents the primary demand for AHTSs and has historically been the most volatile segment of the North Sea market. While PSVs support the exploration segment, they also support the production platform and field development and construction segments, which generally are not affected significantly by the volatility in demand for the AHTSs. Our North Sea-based fleet is oriented toward supply vessels that work production platform support and field development and construction which are the more stable segments of the market. 
 
Unless deployed to one of our other operating segments under long-term contract, vessels based in the North Sea but operating temporarily out of the region are included in our North Sea operating segment statistics, and all vessels based out of the region are supported through our onshore bases in Aberdeen, Scotland and Sandnes, Norway. The region typically has weaker periods of demand for vessels in the winter months of December through February primarily due to lower construction activity and harsh weather conditions affecting the movement of drilling rigs. 
 
Market Development
 
Vessel demand in the North Sea is directly related to drilling and development activities in the region and construction work required in support of these activities. Geopolitical events, the demand for oil and natural gas in both mature and emerging countries, commodity prices and a host of other factors influence the expenditures of both independent and major oil and gas companies.
 
Exploration and development spending in the North Sea continued to decrease in 2016, as operators reacted to the decline in commodity prices. Continued depressed commodity pricing through 2016 and future commodity price uncertainty have put long-term planning and significant commitments to future spending on hold as operators focus on cost savings, efficiencies and cash preservation.

Market and Segment Overview
 
The Southeast Asia market is defined as offshore Asia bounded roughly on the west by the Indian subcontinent and on the north by China, then south to Australia and east to the Pacific Islands. This market includes offshore Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea and Vietnam. Traditionally, the design requirements for vessels in this market were generally similar to the requirements of the shallow water U.S. Gulf of Mexico. However, advanced exploration technology and rapid growth in energy demand among many Pacific Rim countries have led to more remote drilling locations, which has increased both the overall demand and the technical requirements for vessels. All vessels based out of the region are supported through our primary onshore base in Singapore.
 
Southeast Asia’s customer environment is broadly characterized by national oil companies of smaller nations and a large number of mid-sized companies, in contrast to many of the other major offshore exploration and production areas of the world, where a few large operators dominate the market. Affiliations with local companies are generally necessary to maintain a viable marketing presence. Our management has been involved in the region for many years and we currently maintain long-standing business relationships with a number of local companies.
 
Market Development
 
Vessels in this market are often smaller than those operating in areas such as the North Sea. However, the varying weather conditions, annual monsoons, severe typhoons and long distances between supply centers in Southeast Asia have allowed for a variety of vessel designs to compete, each suited for a particular set of operating parameters. Vessels designed for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and other areas, where moderate weather conditions prevail, historically made up the bulk of the vessels in the Southeast Asia market. However, over the last several years Southeast Asian and Chinese shipyards have been focusing on larger, newer and higher specification vessels for deepwater projects and inclusion in the larger vessel fleet.
 
Changes in supply and demand dynamics have led to an excess number of vessels. It is possible that vessels currently located in the Arabian/Persian Gulf area, offshore Africa or the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could relocate to the Southeast Asia market; however, not all vessels currently located in those regions would be able to operate in Southeast Asia and oil and natural gas operators in this region are continuing to demand newer, higher specification vessels. Some countries have specified age limitations for vessels to operate in territorial waters, which limitations could adversely affect our ability to work in those markets. In addition, speculative building at Southeast Asian and Chinese yards as described above has led to a significant overhang of new build vessels, particularly in the mid-size PSV class and smaller AHTSs. Southeast Asia is a dynamic market and from time to time certain types of vessels may be subject to more intense competition.

Market and Segment Overview
 
We define the Americas market as offshore North, Central and South America, specifically including the United States, Mexico, Trinidad and Brazil. All vessels based in the Americas are supported from our onshore bases in the United States, Mexico, Trinidad, and Brazil. During 2016, due to the continued decline in the commodities market and the resulting negative impact on demand for OSVs, we experienced further significant downward pressure on our utilization and day rates in all areas in which we operate. In response, we have taken a number of our vessels out of active service (and stacked them) to reduce operating expenses, preserve cash through deferred drydockings and improve the supply/demand balance in the market. We had 22 vessels stacked in the Americas at the end of 2016. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Markets – Americas” included in Part II, Item 7.
Market Development 
 
U.S. Gulf of Mexico
 
Drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico can be divided into three sectors: the shallow waters of the continental shelf, the deepwater and the ultra-deepwater areas. The continental shelf has been explored since the late 1940s and the existing infrastructure and knowledge of this sector allows for incremental drilling costs to be on the lower end of the range of worldwide offshore drilling costs. A surge of deepwater drilling in this sector began in the 1990s as advances in technology made this type of drilling economically feasible. Deepwater and ultra-deepwater drilling is on the higher end of the cost range, and the substantial costs and long lead times required in these types of drilling historically have made it less susceptible to short-term fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas, although all offshore drilling sectors have been dramatically impacted by the current market downturn. We do not expect significant recovery in deepwater or ultra-deepwater drilling until there is some stability in oil prices for several consecutive quarters. Most of our active vessels operate in the deepwater and ultra-deepwater areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
 
At the end of 2016, industry reports indicate that there were 32 “floater” rigs (semi-submersibles and drillships) supporting deepwater drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico with 24 in working locations. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Gulf of Mexico federal offshore oil production accounts for 17% of total U.S. crude oil production.
 
In general, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico remains a protected market. United States law requires that all vessels engaged in Coastwise Trade in the U.S. (which includes vessels servicing rigs and platforms in U.S. waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone), must be owned and managed by U.S. citizens, and be built in and registered under the laws of the United States. “Coastwise Trade”, as defined under the U.S. maritime and vessel documentation laws commonly referred to as the Jones Act, allows only those vessels that are owned and managed by U.S. citizens (as determined by those laws) and built in and registered under the laws of the United States to transport merchandise and passengers for hire between points in U.S. territorial waters. 
 
We are currently actively marketing 11 DP-2 class OSVs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. These vessels support the shelf, deepwater and ultra-deepwater activities of the oil and gas industry including, but not limited to, seismic operations, oil and gas exploration, field development, production, offshore pipeline inspection and survey, subsea installation and oil recovery activities. We believe that drilling operators in the Gulf of Mexico generally prefer DP-2 class vessels. All 23 of our U.S. flagged OSVs that are operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are DP-2 class vessels. 
 
 
13


   Mexico

Since 2005, we have operated Small AHTSs and other OSVs in Mexico. During the past several years, we have from time to time moved various vessels into and out of the area from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In December 2013, Mexico’s Congress approved a constitutional reform to allow private investment in Mexico’s energy sector which effectively ended the state controlled (Petroleos Mexicanos) 75-year monopoly on oil and natural gas extraction and production. Mexico’s recent deepwater oil auction was reported to have surpassed expectations with 8 of 10 blocks awarded by the National Hydrocarbons Commission in the Perdido and Salina Basins to some of the world’s top oil and gas companies. We currently operate two vessels offshore Mexico.
Trinidad          
 
Over the past five years we mobilized several vessels between Trinidad and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea. Given recent licensing and exploration activity in nearby locations, including Suriname and Guyana, we anticipate OSVs operating in Trinidad for the foreseeable future. We currently operate two vessels offshore Trinidad. 
Brazil
 
Brazil, which was once considered a key market for stable, long term PSV charters, continues to feel the effects of low oil prices which have resulted in the cancellation or renegotiation of numerous PSV charters as Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras) defers capital expenditures.  Also, many Brazilian PSV owners have asserted their rights to challenge foreign flagged vessels on their charters. In 2016, we began to wind down our operations in Brazil, and mobilized all but one vessel out of the region. This Brazilian flagged vessel is currently on bareboat charter in Brazil.
 
Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for segment and geographical revenue data during our last three fiscal years.
 
OTHER
 
Seasonality 
 
Operations in the North Sea are generally at their highest levels from April through August and at their lowest levels from December through February primarily due to lower construction activity and harsh weather conditions during the winter months which reduces the demand for movement of drilling rigs and deliveries to offshore platforms. Vessels operating offshore Southeast Asia are generally at their lowest utilization rates during the monsoon season, which moves across the Asian continent between September and early March. The monsoon season for a specific Southeast Asian location is generally about two months. Activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is often lower during the North Atlantic hurricane season of June through November. Operations in any market may, however, be affected by seasonality often related to unusually long or short construction seasons due to, among other things, abnormal weather conditions, as well as market demand associated with increased or decreased drilling and development activities. 
Other Markets 
 
From time to time, we have contracted our vessels outside of our operating segment regions principally on short-term charters offshore Africa and in the Mediterranean region. We look to our core markets for the bulk of our term contracts; however, when the economics of a contract are attractive, or we believe it is strategically advantageous, we may operate our vessels in markets outside of our core regions. The operations of vessels in those markets are generally managed through our offices in the North Sea region. 
Customers, Contract Terms and Competition
 
Our principal customers are major integrated oil and natural gas companies, large independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies working in international markets, and foreign government-owned or controlled oil and natural gas companies. Additionally, our customers also include companies that provide logistic, construction and other services to such oil and natural gas companies and foreign government organizations. Generally, our contracts are industry standard time charters for periods ranging from a few days or months up to ten years. Contract terms vary and often are similar within geographic regions with certain contracts containing cancellation provisions (in some cases permitting cancellation for any reason including, without limitation, convenience) and others containing non-cancellable provisions except in the case of unsatisfactory performance by the vessel. For the year ended December 31, 2016, no customer accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had revenue from BG Group and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation in our North Sea and Americas regions totaling $32.4 million and $31.9 million, respectively, each accounting for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we had revenue from Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and British Petroleum, or BP, in our Americas and North Sea regions totaling $88.7 million and $50.8 million, respectively, each accounting for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenue.

Contract or charter durations vary from single-day to multi-year in length, based upon many different factors that vary by market. Additionally, there are “evergreen” charters (also known as “life of field” or “forever” charters), and at the other end of the spectrum, there are “spot” charters and “short duration” charters, which can vary from a single voyage to charters of less than six months. Longer duration charters are more common where equipment is not as readily available or specific equipment is required. In the North Sea region, multi-year charters are more common and historically have constituted a significant portion of that market. Term charters in the Southeast Asia region have historically been less common than in the North Sea and generally have terms of less than two years. In addition, charters for vessels in support of floating production are typically life of field or “full production horizon” charters. In the Americas, particularly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, charters vary in length from short-term to multi-year periods, many with thirty day cancellation clauses. In Brazil, Mexico and Trinidad contracts are generally multi-year term contracts. As a result of options and frequent renewals, the stated duration of charters may have little correlation with the length of time the vessel is actually contracted to provide services to a particular customer. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Fleet Commitments and Backlog” included in Part II, Item 7. 
 
Managed vessels add to the market presence of the manager but provide limited direct financial contribution. Management fees consist of a fixed annual management fee plus a monthly percentage of the charterhire day rate. The manager is typically responsible for disbursement of funds for operating the vessel on behalf of the owner. Currently, we have three vessels under management, all of which are stacked. 
 
Substantially all of our charters are fixed in British Pounds, or GBP; Norwegian Kroner, or NOK; Euros; or U.S. Dollars. We attempt to reduce currency risk by matching each vessel’s contract revenue to the currency in which its operating expenses are incurred. 
 
We have numerous mid-size and large competitors in the North Sea, Southeast Asia and Americas markets, some of which have significantly greater financial resources than we have. We compete principally on the basis of suitability of equipment, price and service. In the Americas region, we benefit from the provisions of the Jones Act which limits vessels that can operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to those with U.S. ownership. Also, in certain foreign countries, preferences given to vessels owned by local companies may be mandated by local law or by national oil companies. We have attempted to mitigate some of the impact of such preferences through affiliations with local companies.
 
Government and Environmental Regulation
 
We must comply with extensive government regulation in the form of international conventions, federal, state and local laws and regulations in jurisdictions where our vessels operate and/or are registered. These conventions, laws and regulations govern matters of environmental protection, worker health and safety, vessel and port security, and the manning, construction, ownership and operation of vessels. Our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the United States Coast Guard, the National Transportation Safety Board and the United States Custom and Border Protection, or CBP, and their foreign equivalents, and to regulation by private industry organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping and Det Norske Veritas. The Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board set safety standards and are authorized to investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards, while the CBP is authorized to inspect vessels at will. We are also subject to international laws and conventions and the laws of international jurisdictions where we operate. We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable laws and regulations. 
Maritime Regulations
 
We are subject to the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, which provides that, upon proclamation by the President of the United States of a national emergency or a threat to the security of the national defense, the Secretary of Transportation may requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by United States citizens (which includes United States corporations), including vessels under construction in the United States. If one of the vessels in our fleet were purchased or requisitioned by the federal government under this law, we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a requisition, the fair market value of charter hire. However, we would not be entitled to be compensated for any consequential damages we suffer as a result of the requisition or purchase of any of our vessels.
 
Under the Jones Act, the privilege of transporting merchandise or passengers for hire in Coastwise Trade in U.S. territorial waters is restricted to only those Jones Act qualified vessels that are owned and managed by U.S. citizens and are built in and registered under the laws of the United States. A corporation is not considered a U.S. citizen unless:
 

● | the corporation is organized under the laws of the U.S. or of a state, territory or possession thereof;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the chief executive officer, by whatever title, and the chairman of the board of directors are U.S. citizens;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | directors representing not more than a minority of the number of directors of such corporation necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business are non-U.S. citizens; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | at least a majority, or in the case of an endorsement for operating in Coastwise Trade, 75 percent of the ownership and voting power of the shares of the capital stock is owned by, voted by and controlled by U.S. citizens, free from any trust or fiduciary obligations in favor of, or any contract or understanding under which voting power or control may be exercised directly or indirectly on behalf of non-U.S. citizens.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
 
15



We are currently a U.S. citizen under these requirements, eligible to engage in Coastwise Trade. If we fail to comply with these U.S. citizen requirements, however, we would likely no longer be considered a U.S. citizen under the applicable laws. Such an event could result in our ineligibility to engage in Coastwise Trade, the imposition of substantial penalties against us, including seizure and forfeiture of our vessels, and the inability to flag our vessels in the United States and maintain a coastwise endorsement, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Environmental Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations regarding the emission or discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. As some environmental laws impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances, we could be subject to liability even if we were not negligent or at fault. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, including charterers.
 
Numerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, analogous state agencies, and, in certain instances, citizens’ groups, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, revocation of permits, issuance of corrective action orders and suspension or termination of our operations. Environmental laws and regulations may change in ways that substantially increase costs, or impose additional requirements or restrictions which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental laws and regulations, but failure to comply could have material adverse consequences. Environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, including the suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. As such, there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not be incurred in the future.
 
International Safety Management Code
 
The International Maritime Organization, or IMO, has made the regulations of the International Safety Management Code, or ISM Code, mandatory through the adoption by flag states of the ISM Code under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. The ISM Code provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships, pollution prevention and certain crew and vessel certifications. IMO has also adopted the International Ship & Port Facility Security Code, or ISPS Code. The ISPS Code provides that owners or operators of certain vessels and facilities must provide security and security plans for their vessels and facilities and obtain appropriate certification of compliance. We believe all of our vessels presently are certificated in accordance with ISPS Code. The risks of incurring substantial compliance costs, liabilities and penalties for non-compliance are inherent in offshore marine operations. 
International Labour Organization’s Maritime Labour Convention
 
The International Labour Organization’s Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, or the Convention, mandates globally, among other things, seafarer living and working conditions (accommodations, wages, conditions of employment, health and other benefits) aboard ships that are engaged in commercial activities. Since its initial entry into force on August 20, 2013, 79 countries have now ratified the Convention, making for a diverse geographic footprint of enforcement.
 
Accordingly, we continue prioritizing certification of our vessels to Convention requirements based on the dates of enforcement by countries in which we have operations, perform maintenance and repairs at shipyards, or may make port calls during ocean voyages. Once obtained, vessel certifications are maintained, regardless of the area of operation. Additionally, where possible, we continue to work with operationally identified flag states to seek substantial equivalencies to comparable national and industry laws that meet the intent of the Convention, but allow us to maintain our long-standing operational protocols and mitigate changes to our business processes. As ratifications continue, we continue to assess our global seafarer labor relationships and fleet operational practices not only to undertake compliance with the Convention but also to gauge the impact of effective enforcement, the effects of which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
 
MARPOL
 
The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978, or MARPOL, is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by vessels from operational or accidental causes. It has been updated by amendments through the years and is implemented in the United States by the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships. MARPOL has six specific annexes; Annex I governs oil pollution, Annex V governs garbage pollution, and Annex VI governs air pollution.
 
 
16



MARPOL Annex VI, which addresses air emissions from vessels, requires the use of low sulfur fuel worldwide in both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel engines on ships. Annex VI also specifies requirements for Emission Control Areas, or ECAs, with stricter limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas. Historically, ships operating in the Baltic Sea ECA, the North Sea/English Channel ECA and the North American ECA were required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 1% or use alternative emission reduction methods rather than the current 3.5% global (non-ECA) limit. Beginning in January 2015, the fuel sulfur content limit in ECAs was reduced to 0.1%. The MARPOL global limit on fuel sulfur content outside of ECAs will be reduced to 0.5% on and after January 2020. We may incur additional compliance costs as part of our efforts to comply with Annex VI and other provisions of MARPOL. In addition, we could face fines and penalties for failure to meet requirements imposed by MARPOL and similar laws related to the operation of our vessels.
 
The Clean Water Act
 
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act, or CWA, imposes strict controls on the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters of the United States. The CWA also provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharge of oil or other hazardous substances in reportable quantities and imposes liability for the costs of removal and remediation of an unauthorized discharge. Many states have laws that are analogous to the CWA and also require remediation of accidental releases of petroleum in reportable quantities. Our vessels routinely transport diesel fuel to offshore rigs and platforms and also carry diesel fuel for their own use. We maintain response plans as required by the Clean Water Act to address potential oil and fuel spills from either our vessels or our shore-based facilities.
 
In addition, the CWA established the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, permitting program, which governs discharges of pollutants into navigable waters of the United States from point sources, such as vessels operating in the navigable waters. Pursuant to the NPDES permitting program, the EPA issued a Vessel General Permit, or VGP. Beginning in December 2013, the EPA implemented the Phase II VGP Regime, or 2013 VGP, which covers 27 types of discharges. The 2013 VGP applies to U.S. and foreign-flag commercial vessels that are at least 79 feet in length, and therefore applies to our vessels. The 2013 VGP requires vessel owners and operators to adhere to “best management practices” to manage the covered discharges, including ballast water, which occur normally in the operation of a vessel. In addition, the 2013 VGP requires vessel owners and operators to implement various training, inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, as well as corrective actions upon identification of each deficiency. The purpose of these limitations is to reduce the number of living organisms discharged via ballast water into waters regulated by the 2013 VGP. The 2013 VGP also contains requirements for oil-to-sea interfaces, which seeks to improve environmental protection of U.S. waters, by requiring all vessels to use an Environmentally Acceptable Lubricant in all oil-to-sea interfaces, unless not technically feasible. These regulations may increase the costs of compliance for our operations. In addition, failure to comply with the requirements of the 2013 VGP and other provisions of the CWA could result in the imposition of substantial fines and penalties.
 
The Oil Pollution Act
 
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, establishes a comprehensive regulatory and liability regime designed to increase pollution prevention, ensure better spill response capability, increase liability for oil spills, and facilitate prompt compensation for cleanup and damages. OPA is applicable to owners and operators whose vessels trade with the United States or its territories or possessions, or whose vessels operate in the navigable waters of the United States (generally three nautical miles from the coastline) and the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone of the United States. Under OPA, vessel owners, operators and bareboat charterers are “responsible parties” and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless it is subsequently determined by the Coast Guard or a court of competent jurisdiction that the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for removal costs and damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels up to their limits of liability, unless the limits are broken as described below. “Damages” are defined broadly under OPA to include:

● | natural resources damages and the costs of assessment thereof;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | damages for injury to, or economic losses resulting from the destruction of, real or personal property;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees and profits by the United States government, and any state or political subdivision thereof;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to property or natural resources damage;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the net costs of providing increased or additional public services necessitated by a spill response, such as protection from fire, safety or other hazards; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the loss of subsistence use of natural resources.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 
OPA, through implementing regulations, currently limits the liability of responsible parties for discharges from non-tank vessels to $1,100 per gross ton or $939,800, whichever is greater. These limits are subject to increase. OPA’s liability limits do not apply: (1) if an incident was proximately caused by violation of applicable federal safety, construction or operating regulations or by a responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (2) if the responsible party fails or refuses to report the incident, fails to provide reasonable cooperation and assistance requested by a responsible official in connection with oil removal activities, or without sufficient cause fails to comply with an order issued under OPA. If an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge were to occur, we may be liable for costs and damages, which costs and liabilities could be material to our results of operations and financial position.
 
 
17



Hazardous Wastes and Substances
 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, also known as CERCLA or Superfund, and similar laws, impose liability for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. CERCLA currently exempts crude oil from the definition of hazardous substances for purposes of the statute, but our operations may involve the use or handling of other materials that may be classified as hazardous substances. CERCLA assigns strict liability to each responsible party for all response costs, as well as natural resource damages. CERCLA also imposes liability similar to OPA and provides compensation for cleanup, removal and natural resource damages. Liability per vessel under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5 million, unless the release is the result of willful misconduct or willful negligence, the primary cause of the release was a violation of applicable safety, construction or operating standards or regulations, or the responsible person fails to provide reasonable cooperation and assistance in connection with response activities, in which case liability is unlimited. A responsible person may be liable to the United States for punitive damages up to three times the amount of any costs incurred by the federal Hazardous Substances Superfund as a result of such person’s failure to take proper action. We could be held liable for releases of hazardous substances that resulted from operations by third parties not under our control or for releases associated with practices performed by us or others that were standard in the industry at the time. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment.
 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, regulates the generation, transportation, storage, treatment and disposal of onshore hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of wastes. We generate non-hazardous wastes and small quantities of hazardous wastes in connection with routine operations. We believe that all of the wastes that we generate are handled in all material respects in compliance with the RCRA and analogous state statutes.
 
Insurance
 
   We review our insurance coverages annually.  In particular, we assess our coverage levels and limits for possible marine liabilities, including pollution, personal injury or death, and property damage.  Our most recent review did not result in any substantial adjustments to our coverages or limits.
Litigation
 
We are not a party to any material pending regulatory litigation or other proceeding and we are unaware of any threatened litigation or proceeding, which, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
Employees
 
We have approximately 900 employees located principally in the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway and Southeast Asia. Through our contract with a crewing agency, we participate in the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements for approximately 450 contract crew members, approximately half of our labor force, who are members of two North Sea unions. Wages are renegotiated annually in the second half of each year for the North Sea unions. We have no other collective bargaining agreements; however, we do employ crew members who are members of national unions but we do not participate in the negotiation of those collective bargaining agreements. We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory. To date, our operations have not been interrupted by strikes or work stoppages. In addition, our obligations to our crew members are governed by the International Labour Organization’s Maritime Labour Convention which has been adopted in varying degrees by different flag states. We have adopted proactive procedures to ensure that we comply with or are entitled to an exemption from the Convention.
