Overview 
 We are a leading provider of temporary mechanical circulatory support devices, and we offer a continuum of care to heart failure patients. We develop, manufacture and market proprietary products that are designed to enable the heart to rest, heal and recover by improving blood flow to the coronary arteries and end-organs and/or temporarily assisting the pumping function of the heart. Our products are used in the cardiac catheterization lab, or cath lab, by interventional cardiologists, the electrophysiology lab, the hybrid lab and in the heart surgery suite by cardiac surgeons. A physician may use our devices for patients who are in need of hemodynamic support prophylactically, urgently or emergently before, during or after angioplasty or heart surgery procedures. We believe that heart recovery is the optimal clinical outcome for a patient experiencing heart failure because it enhances the potential for the patient to go home with their own heart, facilitating the restoration of quality of life. In addition, we believe that, for the care of such patients, heart recovery is often the most cost-effective solution for the healthcare system.
 Our strategic focus and the driver of our revenue growth is the market penetration of our family of Impella® heart pumps. The Impella device portfolio, which includes the Impella 2.5®, Impella CP®, Impella RP®, Impella LD® and Impella 5.0® devices, has supported numerous patients worldwide. All of our product and service revenue in the near future will be from our Impella devices. 
 In March 2015, we received FDA approval of a PMA for use of the Impella 2.5 device during elective and urgent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, procedures. In December 2016, the FDA expanded this PMA approval in the U.S. to include the Impella CP device. With these approved indications, the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP devices provide the only minimally invasive treatment options indicated for use during high-risk PCI procedures in the U.S. In April 2016, the FDA approved a PMA supplement for our Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices to provide treatment for ongoing cardiogenic shock that occurs following a heart attack or open heart surgery. The intent of our Impella system therapy is to reduce ventricular work and to provide the circulatory support necessary to allow heart recovery and early assessment of residual myocardial function.
 In September 2017, we received FDA approval of a PMA for the Impella RP heart pump. The Impella RP heart pump is indicated for providing temporary right ventricular support for up to 14 days in patients with a body surface area ≥1.5 m², who develop acute right heart failure or decompensation following left ventricular assist device implantation, myocardial infarction, heart transplant, or open-heart surgery. With this approval, the Impella RP heart pump is the only percutaneous temporary ventricular support device that is FDA-approved as safe and effective for right heart failure as stated in the indication.
 In February 2018, we received two expanded PMA approvals from the FDA for our Impella heart pumps. The first expanded approval is for use of Impella 2.5, CP, 5.0 and LD heart pumps on patients with cardiogenic shock associated with cardiomyopathy, including peripartum and postpartum cardiomyopathy.  The second expanded PMA approval is for use of the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP heart pumps during elective and high-risk PCI procedures.  This expanded PMA approval confirms Impella support as appropriate in patients with severe coronary artery disease, complex anatomy and extensive comorbidities, with or without depressed ejection fraction.  
 In April 2018, we received FDA approval for Impella CP with SmartAssist and Optical Sensor which is intended to provide enhanced monitoring capability, reduce setup time and improve ease of use for physicians.  The optical sensor technology is also approved under CE Mark in the European Union.
 In September 2016, we received Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour & Welfare, or MHLW, for our Impella 2.5 and Impella 5.0 heart pumps to provide treatment of drug-resistant acute heart failure in Japan. In July 2017, we received approval from the MHLW for reimbursement for the Impella 2.5 and 5.0 heart pumps. Reimbursement in Japan for the Impella 2.5 and 5.0 is equivalent to our average Impella sales price in the U.S. We commenced commercialization in Japan during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and have begun a slow commercial launch of Impella in Japan. The first Japanese patient was treated with the Impella device in October 2017. 
 Our Impella 2.5, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella CP and Impella RP devices also have CE Mark approval and Health Canada approval, which allows us to market these devices in the European Union and Canada.
 In April 2018, we announced that we have received CE marking approval in the European Union for the Impella 5.5 heart pump and the first patient was treated at University Heart Center in Hamburg, Germany.  The Impella 5.5 heart pump is not approved for use or sale in the U.S.

In May 2017, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in the FDA approved prospective multi-center feasibility study, STEMI Door to Unloading with Impella CP system in acute myocardial infarction. The trial focuses on the feasibility and safety of unloading the left ventricle using the Impella CP heart pump prior to primary PCI in patients presenting with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, or STEMI, without cardiogenic shock with the hypothesis that this will potentially reduce infarct size. The study, which received FDA approval in October 2016, will enroll up to 50 patients at 10 sites. We expect to complete enrollment in the first half of fiscal 2019.
 We expect to continue to make additional PMA supplement submissions for our Impella portfolio of devices for additional indications.

 Our Existing Products 
 Impella 2.5®
 The Impella 2.5 device is a percutaneous micro heart pump with an integrated motor and sensors. The device is designed primarily for use by interventional cardiologists to support patients in the cath lab who may require assistance to maintain circulation. The Impella 2.5 heart pump can be quickly inserted via the femoral artery to reach the left ventricle of the heart, where it is directly deployed to draw blood out of the ventricle and deliver it to the circulatory system. This function is intended to reduce ventricular work and provide blood flow to vital organs. The Impella 2.5 heart pump is introduced with normal interventional cardiology procedures and can pump up to 2.5 liters of blood per minute.
 The Impella 2.5 device received 510(k) clearance from the FDA in June 2008 for partial circulatory support for up to six hours. In March 2015, we received PMA approval from the FDA for the use of the Impella 2.5 device during elective and urgent high-risk PCI procedures. With this PMA approval, the Impella 2.5 device became the first FDA approved hemodynamic support device for use during high-risk PCI procedures. Under this first PMA, the Impella 2.5 is a temporary (up to six hours) ventricular support device indicated for use during high-risk PCI performed in elective or urgent hemodynamically stable patients with severe coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, when a heart team, including a cardiac surgeon, has determined high-risk PCI is the appropriate therapeutic option. Use of the Impella 2.5 device in these patients may prevent hemodynamic instability that may occur during planned temporary coronary occlusions and may reduce periprocedural and post-procedural adverse events. The product labeling allows for the clinical decision by physicians to leave the Impella 2.5 device in place beyond the intended duration of up to six hours should unforeseen circumstances arise.
 In April 2016, the FDA approved a supplement to our March 2015 PMA for the use of our Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices to provide treatment for ongoing cardiogenic shock. This PMA supplement covers a set of indications related to the use of the Impella devices in patients suffering cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery and allows for a longer duration of support.

Pursuant to the April 2016 PMA approval, the Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD catheters, in conjunction with the Automated Impella Controller, or AIC, were approved as temporary ventricular support devices intended for short term use (≤ 4 days for the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP, and ≤ 6 days for the Impella 5.0 and LD) and indicated for the treatment of ongoing cardiogenic shock that occurs immediately (< 48 hours) following acute myocardial infarction or open heart surgery as a result of isolated left ventricular failure that is not responsive to optimal medical management and conventional treatment measures. The intent of the Impella system therapy is to reduce ventricular work and to provide the circulatory support necessary to allow heart recovery and early assessment of residual myocardial function.  Optimal medical management and convention treatment measures include volume loading and use of pressors and inotropes, with or without an intraortic balloon pump, or IABP.
 The Impella 2.5 device has CE Mark approval in the European Union for up to five days of use and is approved for use in up to 40 countries. The Impella 2.5 device also has Health Canada approval which allows us to market the device in Canada.
 In September 2016, we received PMDA approval from the Japanese MHLW for our Impella 2.5 and Impella 5.0 heart pumps to provide treatment of drug-resistant acute heart failure in Japan. In July 2017, we received approval from the MHLW for reimbursement of the Impella 2.5 and 5.0 heart pumps. Reimbursement in Japan for the Impella 2.5 and 5.0 is equivalent to our average Impella sales price in the U.S. and we commenced commercialization in Japan during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The first Japanese patient was treated with the Impella device in October 2017.
 In February 2018, we received two expanded PMA approvals from the FDA for our Impella heart pumps. The first expanded PMA approval is for use of Impella 2.5, CP, 5.0 and LD heart pumps on patients with cardiogenic shock associated with cardiomyopathy, including peripartum and postpartum cardiomyopathy.  The second expanded PMA approval was for use of the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP heart pumps during elective and high-risk PCI procedures.  This expanded PMA approval confirms Impella support as appropriate in patients with severe coronary artery disease, complex anatomy and extensive comorbidities, with or without depressed ejection fraction.  
 Impella CP®
 The Impella CP device provides blood flow of approximately one liter more per minute than the Impella 2.5 device and is primarily used by either interventional cardiologists to support patients in the cath lab or by cardiac surgeons in the heart surgery suite.
 In September 2012, we announced that the Impella CP device received 510(k) clearance from the FDA. In April 2016, the FDA approved the PMA supplement for certain of our devices, including our Impella CP device to provide treatment for ongoing cardiogenic shock.
 In February 2018, we received two expanded PMA approvals from the FDA for our Impella heart pumps. The first expanded PMA approval is for use of Impella 2.5, CP, 5.0 and LD heart pumps on patients with cardiogenic shock associated with cardiomyopathy, including peripartum and postpartum cardiomyopathy.  The second expanded PMA approval is for use of the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP heart pumps during elective and high-risk PCI procedures.  This expanded PMA approval confirms Impella support as appropriate in patients with severe coronary artery disease, complex anatomy and extensive comorbidities, with or without depressed ejection fraction.  
 These PMA approvals allow the Impella CP to be used as a temporary (≤ 6 hours) ventricular support system indicated for use during high risk PCI procedures performed in elective or urgent hemodynamically stable patients with severe coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, when a heart team, including a cardiac surgeon, has determined that high-risk PCI is the appropriate therapeutic option. The product labeling allows for the clinical decision by physicians to leave the Impella CP device in place beyond the intended duration of up to six hours should unforeseen circumstances arise.
 The Impella CP device has CE Mark approval in the European Union for up to five days of use and is approved for use in up to 40 countries.
 In April 2018, we received FDA approval for Impella CP with SmartAssist and Optical Sensor which is intended to provide enhanced monitoring capability, reduce setup time and improve ease of use for physicians.  The optical sensor technology is also approved under CE Mark in the European Union.

In May 2017, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in the FDA approved prospective multi-center feasibility study, STEMI Door to Unloading with Impella CP system in acute myocardial infarction. The trial focuses on the feasibility and safety of unloading the left ventricle using the Impella CP heart pump prior to primary PCI in patients presenting with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, or STEMI, without cardiogenic shock with the hypothesis that this will potentially reduce infarct size. The study, which received FDA investigational device approval to proceed in October 2016, will enroll up to 50 patients at 10 sites. We expect to complete enrollment in the first half of fiscal 2019.
 The primary endpoints of the feasibility study will focus on safety, including major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, or MACCE, at 30 days. All patients will undergo cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to assess infarct size as a percent of left ventricular mass at 30 days post-PCI. Patients will be randomized to Impella CP placement with immediate primary PCI, or to Impella CP placement with 30 minutes of unloading prior to primary PCI. The hypothesis of this novel approach to treating STEMI patients, based on extensive mechanistic research, is that unloading the left ventricle prior to PCI reduces myocardial work load, oxygen demand and also initiates a cardio-protective effect at the myocardial cell level, which may alleviate myocardial damage caused by reperfusion injury at the time of revascularization. This feasibility study will help refine the protocol and lay the groundwork for a future pivotal study with more sites and patients and will be designed for statistical significance.
 Impella 5.0® and Impella LD®
 The Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices are percutaneous micro heart pumps with integrated motors and sensors for use primarily in the heart surgery suite. These devices are designed to support patients who require higher levels of circulatory support as compared to the Impella 2.5.
 The Impella 5.0 device can be inserted into the left ventricle via femoral cut down or through the axillary artery. The Impella 5.0 device is passed into the ascending aorta, across the valve and into the left ventricle. The Impella LD device is similar to the Impella 5.0 device, but it is implanted directly into the ascending aorta through an aortic graft.  Both of these procedures are normally performed with the assistance of cardiac surgeons in the surgery suite. The Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices can pump up to five liters of blood per minute, potentially providing full circulatory support.
 The Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices originally received 510(k) clearance in April 2009, for circulatory support for up to six hours.  In April 2016, the FDA approved the PMA supplement for certain of our devices, including the Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices to provide treatment for ongoing cardiogenic shock following a heart attack or open heart surgery. In February 2018, we received an expanded FDA PMA approval for use of Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0, and Impella LD heart pumps to provide treatment for heart failure associated with cardiomyopathy leading to cardiogenic shock.  This approval expands the previous indication for acute myocardial infarction, or AMI, cardiogenic shock and post-cardiotomy shock, or PCCS, received in April 2016.  
 The Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices have CE Mark approval in the European Union for up to ten days’ duration and are approved for use in over 40 countries.
 In July 2017, we received approval from the Japanese MHLW for reimbursement for the Impella 2.5 and 5.0 heart pumps. Reimbursement in Japan of the Impella 2.5 and 5.0 is equivalent to our average Impella sales price in the U.S. and we commenced commercialization in Japan during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The first Japanese patient was treated with the Impella device in October 2017. 
 Impella RP®
 The Impella RP is a percutaneous catheter-based axial flow pump that is designed to allow greater than four liters of blood flow per minute and is intended to provide the flow and pressure needed to compensate for right side heart failure. The Impella RP is the first percutaneous single access heart pump designed for right heart support to receive FDA approval. The Impella RP device is approved to provide support of the right heart during times of acute failure for certain patients who have received a left ventricle assist device or have suffered heart failure due to AMI, a failed heart transplant, or following open heart surgery.
 In November 2012, the Impella RP device received U.S. investigational device exemption, or IDE, approval from the FDA for use in RECOVER RIGHT, a pivotal clinical study in the U.S. This was a study of 30 patients who presented signs of right side heart failure, required hemodynamic support, and were capable of being treated in the catheterization lab or cardiac surgery suite. The study was completed in March 2014 and collected safety and effectiveness data on the percutaneous use of the Impella RP device and was submitted to the FDA in support of a Humanitarian Device Exemption, or HDE. An HDE is similar to a PMA application but is intended for patient populations of 8,000 or less per year in the U.S. and is subject to certain profit and use restrictions. In January 2015, we received HDE approval for the Impella RP device from the FDA.

In September 2017, we received FDA approval of a PMA for the Impella RP heart pump. This latest approval follows the prior FDA HDE received in January 2015 and adds the Impella RP heart pump to our platform of PMA approved devices. The Impella RP heart pump is indicated for providing temporary right ventricular support for up to 14 days in patients with a body surface area ≥1.5 m², who develop acute right heart failure or decompensation following left ventricular assist device implantation, myocardial infarction, heart transplant, or open-heart surgery. With this approval, the Impella RP heart pump is the only percutaneous temporary ventricular support device that is FDA-approved as safe and effective for right heart failure as stated in the indication.
 In April 2014, the Impella RP device received CE Mark approval which allows for commercial sales of the Impella RP device in the European Union and other countries that require a CE Mark approval for commercial sales.

 The Impella 5.5 device is designed to be a percutaneous micro heart pump with integrated motors and sensors. The Impella 5.5 device is designed to be smaller, provide months of hemodynamic support and is expected to allow for greater than five liters of blood flow per minute. In April 2018, we announced that we received CE mark approval in the European Union for the Impella 5.5 heart pump and the first patient was treated at University Heart Center in Hamburg, Germany. We anticipate conducting a first-in-man trial outside of the U.S. in calendar year 2018. The Impella 5.5 pump has not been approved for commercial use or sale in the U.S.
 Impella ECP™
 The Impella ECP pump is designed for blood flow of greater than three liters per minute. It is intended to be delivered on a standard sized catheter and will include an expandable inflow in the left ventricle. We anticipate conducting a first-in-human trial outside of the U.S. in fiscal 2019. The Impella ECP pump is still in development and has not been approved for commercial use or sale.
 In July 2014, we acquired all of the issued shares of ECP Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH, or ECP, a German limited liability company based in Berlin, Germany, for $13.0 million in cash, with additional potential payments up to a maximum of $15.0 million based on the achievement of certain technical, regulatory and commercial milestones. In connection with our acquisition of ECP, ECP acquired all of the issued shares of AIS GmbH Aachen Innovative Solutions, or AIS, a German limited liability company, for $2.8 million in cash which was provided by us. AIS, based in Aachen, Germany, holds certain intellectual property useful to ECP’s business, and, prior to being acquired by ECP, had licensed such intellectual property to ECP.

 Summary of Recent Financial Performance 
 For fiscal 2018, we recognized net income of $112.2 million, or $2.54 per basic share and $2.45 per diluted share, compared to $52.1 million, or $1.21 per basic share and $1.17 per diluted share for the prior fiscal year. For fiscal year 2018, total revenue was $593.7 million, up 33% compared to revenue of $445.3 million in fiscal year 2017. The increase in our net income for fiscal 2018 was driven primarily by higher Impella product revenue due to greater utilization of our Impella devices in the U.S. and Germany. We also received regulatory approval in Japan during September 2017 and we began a limited commercial launch in Japan during fiscal 2018. Further, the adoption of ASU 2016-09 (defined below) resulted in an increase of net income of $31.0 million, or $0.70 per basic and $0.68 per diluted share for the year ended March 31, 2018.  Additionally, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Reform Act resulted in a decrease in net income of $21.4 million, or $0.48 per basic and $0.47 per diluted share for the year ended March 31, 2018. Information regarding our total assets are contained within our consolidated financial statements in this Report.

Our Markets 
 According to the AHA’s Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics 2018 Update Report, coronary heart disease, or CHD, causes approximately one of every seven deaths in the U.S. CHD is a condition of the coronary arteries that causes reduced blood flow and insufficient oxygen delivery to the affected portion of the heart. CHD leads to acute myocardial infarction, or AMI, commonly known as a heart attack, which may lead to heart failure, a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the body’s major organs. 
 A broad spectrum of therapies exists for the treatment of patients in early stages of CHD. Angioplasty procedures and stents are commonly used in the cath lab to restore and increase blood flow to the heart. These treatments are often successful in slowing the progression of heart disease, extending life, and/or improving the quality of life for some period of time. Patients presenting with acute cardiac injuries potentially have recoverable hearts. Treatment for these patients in pre-shock in the cath lab is primarily focused on hemodynamic stabilization. Acute heart failure patients in profound shock typically require treatment in the surgery suite. These are patients suffering from cardiogenic shock after a heart attack, post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock or myocarditis complicated with cardiogenic shock. Chronic heart failure patients have hearts that are unlikely to be recoverable due to left and/or right-side heart failure and their conditions cause their hearts to fail over time. Limited therapies exist today for patients with severe, end-stage, or chronic heart failure. 
 In more severe cases of heart failure, patients are sent directly to the surgery suite for coronary bypass or valve replacement surgery. The most severe acute heart failure patients are in profound cardiogenic shock, including those suffering from myocarditis (a viral attack of the heart), or from those suffering from an impaired ability of the heart to pump blood after a heart attack or heart surgery. These patients typically require treatments involving the use of mechanical circulatory support devices that provide increased blood flow and reduce the stress on the heart. Many less severe patients in the cath lab could also benefit from circulatory support devices or other clinical treatment, which could potentially prevent them from entering into profound shock. 
 There are a few primary types of devices used in the cath lab and surgery suite in the U.S. for circulatory support for pre-shock and profound shock patients: intra-aortic balloons, or IABs, percutaneous assist devices, and surgical ventricular assist devices, or VADs. 
 An IAB is an inflatable balloon inserted via a catheter into a patient’s circulatory system and is inflated and deflated in the aorta. This is used as an initial line of therapy in the cath lab or the surgery suite for patients with diminished heart function. However, IABs typically provide only limited enhancement and depend on the patient’s own heart to generate the majority of the patient’s blood flow. In addition, IABs are often required to be used in conjunction with inotropes or other drugs to stimulate heart muscle ejection. The use of these drugs, however, increases the risk of mortality. Further, the clinical efficacy of IABs has been challenged due to the conclusions of the randomized, prospective, open-label, multicenter “SHOCK II” Trial. The conclusion of the trial was that the use of IAB counterpulsation did not significantly reduce 30-day mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction for whom an early revascularization strategy was planned. Further, IABs have limited effectiveness in patients that are arrhythmic and/or in cardiogenic shock and published reports have indicated that IABs do not reduce mortality for patients in cardiogenic shock. 
 Percutaneous assist devices and VADs are mechanical devices that help the failing heart pump blood or take over the pumping function of the failing heart. Historically, VADs have been highly invasive and require implantation in the surgery suite. Percutaneous assist devices allow for less invasive placement and removal, and can be done through a small puncture in the leg in the cath lab, electrophysiology lab, or operating room. The use of surgically placed VADs generally falls into three sub-categories: recovery, bridge-to-transplant and destination therapy. 
 Recovery VADs are designed to enable the patient’s heart to rest and potentially recover so that the patient can return home with his or her own heart. Because recovery is the goal, these devices are designed to minimize damage to heart tissue and are removed once the patient’s heart has recovered. If possible, recovery of a patient’s heart is generally preferred to transplantation or prolonged device implantation, both of which have significant side effects for the patient and increase the risk of mortality. We believe heart recovery is a preferred clinical outcome for patients, since it generally lowers the overall relative cost to the healthcare system versus alternative therapies and treatment paths that may require multiple surgeries, lengthy or repeated hospital stays, chronic therapeutic and immunosuppressant drugs and other related healthcare costs.

Research and Product Development 
 Since our founding in 1981, we have gained substantial expertise in circulatory support through the development of many product platforms to support heart patients. This includes our Impella platform that we currently market and other technologies that we have supported, and sold in the past, which we do not actively market currently. We also continue to work on developing new technologies as well, such as the optical sensor technology for the Impella CP device. Our current strategy is to develop a complete portfolio of products across the continuum of care in heart recovery, primarily focused in the area of circulatory care. We intend to continue to use this experience to develop additional circulatory support products as well as making enhancements to our existing products. In addition, we have a number of new products at various stages of development, some of which integrate the Impella technology platform including the Impella 5.5, Impella ECP and Impella BTR devices. 
 As of March 31, 2018, our research and development staff consisted of 208 full-time employees. We expended $75.3 million, $66.4 million and $49.8 million on research and development in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our research and development expenditures include costs related to clinical trials and studies for our Impella devices. 
 Sales, Clinical Support, Marketing and Field Service 
 As of March 31, 2018, our worldwide sales, clinical support, marketing and field service teams included 482 full-time employees, 406 of whom are in the U.S. and Canada and 76 of whom are in Europe and Asia. In recent years, we have significantly increased the number of our direct sales and clinical support personnel in the U.S and Germany. 
 Our clinical support personnel consist primarily of registered nurses and other personnel with considerable experience in either the surgery suite or the cath lab, and they play a critical role in training physicians in the use of our products. 
 International sales (sales outside the U.S., primarily in Europe) accounted for 11%, 9% and 8% of total revenue during fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 Manufacturing 
 We manufacture our products in Danvers, Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany. Our Aachen facility performs final assembly and manufactures most of our disposable Impella devices, including the Impella 2.5, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella CP and Impella RP devices. Our Danvers facility also manufactures and performs final assembly for the Impella CP device and certain Impella subsystems and accessories, including our Automated Impella Console, or AIC, our console for our Impella devices. In addition, we rely on third-party suppliers to provide us with components used in our existing products and products under development. For example, we outsource some of the manufacturing for components and circuit cards within our consoles. 
 We believe our existing manufacturing facilities give us the necessary physical capacity to produce sufficient quantities of products to meet anticipated demand for at least the next twelve months based on our current revenue forecast. We have recently expanded our manufacturing capacity in both our Aachen and Danvers facilities to support the growing demand for our Impella devices.  We expect to continue to expand our manufacturing capacity as we support expected growing demand for our Impella devices. Our U.S. and German manufacturing facilities are certified as being in compliance with standards established by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and operate under the FDA’s good manufacturing practice requirements for medical devices set forth in the Quality System Regulation, or QSR. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We have developed significant know-how and proprietary technology, upon which our business depends. To protect our know-how and proprietary technology, we rely on trade secret laws, trademarks, patents, copyrights, and confidentiality agreements and other contracts. However, these methods afford only limited protection. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or technology, gain access to our trade secrets or disclose or use such secrets or technology without our approval. 
 A substantial portion of our intellectual property rights relating to the Impella devices and other products under development, such as the Impella 5.5TM, Impella ECPTM, and Impella BTRTM devices, are in the form of trade secrets, rather than patents. We protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. We cannot assure you that our trade secrets will not become known to or be independently developed by our competitors.

 Our patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. Our pending or future patent applications may not be issued. Others may hold or obtain patents that cover aspects or uses of our innovations. The patents of others may render our patents obsolete, limit our ability to patent or practice our innovations, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business. Because foreign patents may afford less protection than U.S. patents, they may not adequately protect our technology. 
 The medical device industry is characterized by a large number of patents and by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation. Our products and technologies could infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. If third parties successfully assert infringement or other claims against us, we may not be able to sell our products or we may have to pay significant damages and ongoing royalties. In addition, patent or intellectual property disputes or litigation may be costly, result in product development delays, or divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. If any such disputes or litigation arise, we may seek to enter into a royalty or licensing arrangement. However, such an arrangement may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. We may decide, in the alternative, to litigate the claims or seek to design around the patented or otherwise protected proprietary technology, which may also be costly and time consuming. 
 The U.S. government may obtain certain rights to use or disclose technical data developed under government contracts that supported the development of some of our products. We retain the right to obtain patents on any inventions developed under those contracts, provided we follow prescribed procedures and are subject to a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to the U.S. government. 
 Competition 
 
Competition among providers of treatments for the failing heart is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards. We compete with many companies that have substantially greater or broader financial, product development, sales and marketing resources and experience than we do. Furthermore, new product development and technological change characterize the areas in which we compete. Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including drug therapies. We must continue to develop and commercialize new products and technologies to remain competitive in the cardiovascular medical technology industry. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority supported by extensive data, and innovative features that enhance patient benefit, product performance, ease of use and reliability. Customer and clinical support, and data that demonstrate both improvement in a patient's quality of life and a product's cost-effectiveness are additional aspects of competition.
 
The cardiovascular segment of the medical technology industry is dynamic and subject to significant change due to cost-of-care considerations, regulatory reform, industry and customer consolidation and evolving patient needs. The ability to provide products and technologies that demonstrate value and improve clinical outcomes is becoming increasingly important for medical technology manufacturers.
 
We are aware of other heart replacement device research efforts in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan. In addition, there are a number of companies, including Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic, Edwards Lifesciences, Boston Scientific, CardiacAssist (Tandem Life), Terumo Heart, Teleflex, Getinge (Maquet Cardiovascular), and several early-stage companies, that are developing heart assist products, including implantable left ventricular assist devices and miniaturized rotary ventricular assist devices that directly and indirectly compete with our products.
 Third-Party Reimbursement 
 Our products and services are generally purchased by healthcare institutions that rely on third-party payers to cover and reimburse the costs of related patient care. In the U.S., as well as in many foreign countries, government-funded or private insurance programs pay the cost of a significant portion of a patient’s medical expenses. No uniform policy of coverage or reimbursement for medical technology exists among all these payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer and by jurisdiction. 
 8


Third-party payers may include government healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, private insurers or managed care organizations. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, is responsible for administering the Medicare program in the U.S. and, along with its contractors, establishes coverage and reimbursement policies for the Medicare program. Medicare’s coverage and reimbursement policies are particularly significant to our business because a large percentage of the population for which our products are intended includes individuals who are Medicare beneficiaries. In addition, private payers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare. We cannot assure that government or private third-party payers will continue to cover and reimburse the procedures using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates for reimbursement will be adequate. 
 Medicare payment may be made, in appropriate cases, for procedures performed in the in-patient hospital setting using our technology. Medicare generally reimburses healthcare institutions in which the procedures are performed based upon prospectively determined amounts. For hospital in-patient stays, the prospective payment generally is determined by the patient’s condition and other patient data and procedures performed during the in-patient stay, using a classification system known as International Classification of Diseases, or ICD, and medical severity diagnosis-related groups, or MS DRGs. Prospective rates are adjusted for, among other things, regional differences, co-morbidity and complications. Hospitals performing in-patient procedures using our devices generally do not receive separate Medicare reimbursement for the specific costs of purchasing or implanting our products. Rather, reimbursement for these costs is bundled with the MS DRG-based payments made to hospitals for the procedures during which our devices are implanted, removed, or replaced. Because prospective payments are based on predetermined rates and may be less than a hospital’s actual costs in furnishing care, hospitals have incentives to lower their in-patient operating costs by utilizing products, devices and supplies that will reduce the length of in-patient stays, decrease labor or otherwise lower their costs. 
 Coverage and reimbursement for procedures to implant, remove or replace our products are generally established in the U.S. market. For instance, Medicare covers the use of LVADs when used for support of blood circulation post-cardiotomy, as a temporary life-support system until a human heart becomes available for transplant, or as destination therapy for patients who require permanent mechanical cardiac support, when the use is consistent with FDA approval and FDA-approved labeling instructions, as applicable. Coverage and reimbursement for procedures to implant the Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0, Impella LD and Impella RP devices are also established for in-hospital use by Medicare including ICD-10 for procedures and MS DRG coding. Actual coverage and payment may vary by local Medicare fiscal intermediary or third-party insurer. Our Impella devices are also covered by commercial and/or Medicare plans of many third-party insurers including Aetna, Humana, Cigna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and United Healthcare. 
 In October 2017, the American Hospital Association, or AHA Coding Clinic publication confirmed an insertion code for all Impella cases thereby billing out to MS-DRG 215, Heart Assist System Implant, for all percutaneous uni-ventricular Impella insertions.  The Company’s Impella heart pumps are now most commonly reimbursed under three MS-DRG categories including: (1) percutaneous, uni-ventricular insertions in MS-DRG 215; (2) right and left side heart support known as bi-ventricular and removal in MS-DRG 1-2; and (3) hospitals receiving transferred patients with removal of the device in MS-DRG 268-269. The AHA and the CMS have facilitated a system of care around the utilization of percutaneous heart pumps, and transfer of patients to specialized centers. This progress also represents the expansion of Impella FDA indications for High Risk PCI, AMI Cardiogenic Shock, and bi-ventricular support.
 In April 2018, CMS released a proposed set of hospital payment levels for patient discharges after October 1, 2018.  The April 2018 Proposed Rule for the Inpatient Prospective Payment System, or IPPS, update includes ICD-10 coding and assignment of percutaneous Impella implantation to MS-DRG 215 for Other Heart Assist System Implant. The Proposed Rule also maintained bi-ventricular Impella support in MS-DRG 1-2 assignments, and Impella hospital transfer and support in MS-DRG 268-269 for the receiving hospital. Impella related procedures were previously assigned to MS-DRG 216-221 for assistance in the catheterization lab only, and were reimbursed at a lower rate than MS-DRG 215 and MS-DRGs 1-2. A designated DRG 215 code will simplify coding and enable hospitals to receive payment in multiple settings and indications. The MS-DRG 215 proposed rate is lower than the previous year based on the CMS process to evaluate hospital charges, length of stay, patient comorbidities, taking into account hospital efficiencies over the prior year. The proposed rule for IPPS is open for public comment until June 2018. The final rulemaking may differ substantially from this proposal and will take effect October 1, 2018.
 In addition to payments to hospitals for procedures using our technology, Medicare makes separate payments to physicians for their professional services when they perform surgeries to implant, remove, replace or repair our devices or when they perform percutaneous insertion and removal of Impella devices. Physicians generally bill for such services using a coding system known as Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes. Physician services performed in connection with the implantation, removal or repositioning of our approved products are billed using a variety of CPT codes. Generally, Medicare payment levels for physician services are based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and are revised annually by CMS.

In general, third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, whether government-funded or commercially insured, are developing a variety of increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, including prospective reimbursement and capitation programs, group purchasing, reducing benefit coverage, requiring second opinions prior to major surgery, negotiating reductions to charges on patient bills, promoting healthier lifestyle initiatives and exploring more cost-effective methods of delivering healthcare. These types of cost containment programs, as well as legislative or regulatory changes to reimbursement policies, could limit the amount which healthcare providers may be willing to pay for our medical devices. 
 In September 2016, we received PMDA approval from the MHLW for our Impella 2.5 and Impella 5.0 heart pumps to provide treatment of drug-resistant acute heart failure in Japan. In July 2017, we received approval from the MHLW for reimbursement of the Impella 2.5 and 5.0 heart pumps. Reimbursement in Japan for the Impella 2.5 and 5.0 is equivalent to our average Impella sales price in the U.S. and we commenced commercialization in Japan during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
 Government Regulation and Other Matters
 
Our products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA, European Community Notified Bodies, and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, to confirm compliance with the various laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our products. We are also governed by federal, state, local, and international laws of general applicability, such as those regulating employee health and safety, and the protection of the environment. Overall, the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business has increased over time.
United States Regulation

In the U.S., the FDA has responsibility for regulating medical devices under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA. The FDA regulates design, development, testing, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, import, export, sale promotion, and record keeping for medical devices, and reporting of adverse events, recalls, or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Many of the devices that we develop, manufacture and market are in a category for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and pre-market clearance or approval requirements. The process of obtaining FDA clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive, lengthy, and costly. FDA review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products. A number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets. Ultimately, the FDA may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance or approval. Additionally, even if a product is cleared or approved, the FDA may require postmarket testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized.
 
The FDA has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order the repair, replacement, or refund of the costs of such devices, or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear to be violative. The FDA also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the QSR concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and medical device reporting regulations, recall regulations, clinical testing regulations, and other requirements. The FDA may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards, or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval, and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. Additionally, the failure to comply with FDA or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines, delays, or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures, injunctions, recalls, refunds, civil money penalties, or criminal prosecution. Our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review. Moreover, the FDA and several other U.S. agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the U.S. and the import of devices into the U.S., which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance.
 
Premarket Regulation 
 The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the statutory framework described in the FFDCA. Our Impella products are categorized as Class III devices. Class III devices are typically life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or new devices that have not been found to be substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices. Class III devices must generally receive PMA approval from the FDA before they can be marketed. 
 10


The PMA approval pathway requires that the applicant demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction, based on valid scientific evidence, that there is a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. During the PMA process, the FDA examines detailed data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the device. This information includes design, development, manufacture, labeling, advertising, preclinical testing and clinical study data. Prior to approving a PMA, the FDA may conduct an inspection of the manufacturing facilities and the clinical sites where supporting studies were conducted. The facility inspection evaluates the company’s compliance with QSR. An inspection of clinical sites evaluates compliance with good clinical practice standards, including, for studies conducted under an IDE that the studies meet the requirements of FDA’s IDE regulations. Typically, the FDA will convene an advisory panel meeting to review the data presented in the PMA. The panel’s recommendation is given substantial weight, but is not binding on the FDA. Under a set of performance measures that the FDA has committed to achieving in return for the receipt of user fees from manufacturers, FDA attempts to review all PMAs not requiring an advisory panel meeting within 180 “FDA days” and review of a PMA application that does require an advisory panel meeting within 320 “FDA days.” The term “FDA days” excludes the time the applicant spends responding to FDA requests for additional information.  While the FDA has approved PMA applications within the allotted time period, reviews can occur over a significantly longer period. 
 Upon completion of its review, the FDA will either approve or deny the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation is favorable, the PMA is approved and the device may be marketed in the U.S. The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions such as post-market collection of clinical data. Failure to comply with the co
nditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the PMA approval. 
A PMA approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a device may be marketed. The FDA interprets th
e FFDCA as prohibiting the promotion of approved medical devices for unapproved uses. After approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement is required in the event of a significant 
modification to the device, the device 
labeling, 
or the manufacturing proce
ss.  The FDA can initiate proceedings to withdraw a PMA approval for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial marketing.
 In March 2015, we received a PMA approval from the FDA for use of the Impella 2.5 device in the U.S. during elective and urgent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, procedures. In December 2016, the FDA expanded this PMA approval in the U.S. to include the Impella CP device. In April 2016, the FDA approved a PMA supplement for our Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices to provide treatment for ongoing cardiogenic shock, which occurs following heart attack or open heart surgery. In September 2017, we received a PMA approval from the FDA for the Impella RP heart pump. In February 2018, we received an expanded FDA PMA approval for the Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0, and Impella LD heart pumps to provide treatment for heart failure associated with cardiomyopathy leading to cardiogenic shock.  This approval expands the previous indication for AMI cardiogenic shock and post-cardiotomy shock, or PCCS, received in April 2016.  Additionally, in February 2018, we received an expanded FDA PMA approval for the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP heart pumps during elective and urgent high-risk PCI procedures. This expanded indication confirms Impella support as appropriate in patients with severe coronary artery disease, complex anatomy and extensive comorbidities, with or without depressed ejection fraction.
 The intent of the treatment is to reduce ventricular work and to provide the circulatory support necessary to allow heart recovery and early assessment of residual myocardial function.  We expect to make additional PMA supplement submissions for additional indications for use for our Impella devices in the future.
 When clinical trials of a device are required in order to obtain FDA approval, the sponsor of the trial is generally required to file an IDE application before commencing the trials. The FDA reviews and must approve an IDE before a clinical study may begin in the U.S. In addition, the clinical study must be approved by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, at each clinical site. The FDA, the IRB, or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including if information emerges suggesting that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. All clinical studies of investigational devices must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. Following the completion of a study, the data from the study must be collected, analyzed and presented in an appropriate submission to the FDA, either as a report submitted to the IDE file or in a marketing application such as a PMA. 
 In addition, certain medical devices can be approved by the FDA in the U.S. under an HDE rather than a PMA. In order for a device to be eligible for an HDE, there must be a qualifying target patient population of less than 8,000 patients per year for which there is no other comparable device available to treat the condition. The FDA must agree that a device meets these criteria before it can be approved under an HDE. FDA approval of an HDE also requires demonstration that the device is safe for its intended application, that it is potentially effective, and that the probable benefits outweigh the associated risks. If another device receives approval through the PMA process that addresses the same patient population as the HDE device, the HDE device may need to be withdrawn from the U.S. market. An approved HDE authorizes sales of the device to any hospital after review and approval by the hospital’s IRB. Proposed modifications to approved HDE devices, like modifications to approved PMA devices, require FDA approval through a new HDE application or an HDE supplement.

Postmarket Regulation 
 The medical devices that we manufacture and distribute pursuant to regulatory clearances or approvals by the FDA and other countries’ regulatory authorities are subject to continuing regulation by those agencies. The FDA reviews design, manufacturing, and distribution practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experience and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Among other FDA req
uirements, we must comply with the FDA’s good manufacturing practice regulations for medical devices, known as the QSR. These regulations govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, testing, manufacture, packaging, lab
eling, storage, installation, and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use. We must also comply with Medical Device Reporting, or MDR requirements, which require us to report to the FDA any incident in any of our products that may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, including medical intervention to prevent a death or serious injury, or in which any of our products malfunctioned and, if such malfunction were to recur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Labeling, advertising, and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. The FDA’s enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses. We are subject to routine inspection by the FDA for compliance with the QSR and MDR requirements, as well as other applicable regulations. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, and requ
ire us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also seek a judicial injunction enjoining 
certain violations of the FFDCA and imposing operating restrictions and assess civil or criminal fines and penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The FDA may also recommend criminal prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Conduct giving rise to civil or criminal penalties may also form the basis for private civil litigation by third-party payers or other persons allegedly harmed by our conduct. Regulatory authorities outside the U.S. enforce similar laws and regulations within their respective jurisdictions.
 The FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing clearance has not been obtained. If the FDA or another regulatory agency determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off-label promotion of our products, the FDA or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion. 
 The FDA can require post-market surveillance, or PMS, for significant risk devices, such as our medical devices, that require ongoing collection, analysis, and periodic submission to the FDA of clinical data during commercialization over a period of up to several years. The PMS data collection requirements are often burdensome and expensive. The failure to comply with the FDA’s regulations can result in enforcement action, including seizure of products, injunction, prosecution, civil fines and penalties, recall and/or suspension of FDA approval. 
 The FDA, in cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, administers controls over the import and export of medical devices into and out of the U.S. International sales of our medical devices that have not received FDA approval are therefore subject to FDA export requirements. The CBP imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of medical devices, including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance. 
 
We are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations, products, and technologies, including:
  
• | federal, state, and foreign anti-kickback laws and regulations, which generally prohibit payments and other financial benefits to physicians or other purchasers of medical products as an inducement to purchase a product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Stark law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to a provider that bills this program for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician (or a member of the physician's immediate family) has a financial relationship with that provider, subject to numerous specific exemptions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restrict the use and disclosure of such information, in particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or PPSA, which requires public disclosure of the financial relationships of United States physicians and teaching hospitals with applicable manufacturers, including medical device, pharmaceutical, and biologics companies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12


 
• | the False Claims Act, or FCA, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program, and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payer, and may be enforced through whistleblower or ‘qui tam’ lawsuits filed by private individuals; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, which can be used to prosecute companies in the U.S. for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties outside the U.S.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability, significant fines or penalties, negative publicity, and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation enforcement activities, and individual settlement agreements that impose a government monitor for a period of several years. To assist in our compliance efforts, we adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our sales and marketing activities in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, including the ABIOMED Code of Conduct and Compliance Policy. 
 
International Regulation

Internationally, the approval and regulation of medical devices is subject to a variety of laws and regulation. In Europe, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Our Impella 2.5, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella CP, Impella RP and AIC are all approved under CE Mark and are available for sale in the European Union and other markets that recognize CE Mark approval. The European Union requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed, maintained, and used in accordance with their intended purpose. National laws conforming to the European Union's legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system. Although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the European Union Medical Devices Directive, individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions. The European Union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the CE Mark. Manufacturers' quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body. In Europe, particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities. 
 
In May 2017, the European Union implemented a new regulatory requirement for medical devices under the MDR. The MDR becomes fully effective in 2020 and will bring significant new requirements for many medical devices, including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation, increased focus on device identification and traceability, and additional postmarket surveillance and vigilance. Compliance with the MDR will require re-certification of many of our products to the enhanced standards.
 In Japan, pre-market approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices. Clinical studies are subject to a stringent "Good Clinical Practices" standard. Approval time frames from the Japanese MHLW vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years, depending on the complexity and risk level of the device. In addition, importation of medical devices into Japan is subject to the "Good Import Practices" regulations. As with any highly regulated market, significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales. 
 
In many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products, we may be subject to regulations affecting, among other things:
  
• | product standards and specifications;
--+--------------------------------------


• | packaging requirements;
--+------------------------


• | labeling requirements;
--+-----------------------


• | marketing restrictions;
--+------------------------


• | product collection and disposal requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | quality system requirements;
--+-----------------------------


• | import restrictions;
--+---------------------


• | tariffs;
--+---------


• | duties; and
--+------------


• | tax requirements.
--+------------------

Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. In some countries, the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing, which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs. In many countries, the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement.
 
Health Care Initiatives
 
Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews, technology assessments, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia. As a result of these changes, the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies. For example, government programs, private health care insurance, and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments, and some third-party payers require their pre-approval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients. These various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies.
 
The delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the department of Health and Human Services in the U.S. and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services. Foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services. Reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the U.S. government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by Medicare. CMS may also review whether and/or under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for Medicare beneficiaries. Changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility.
 
Health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power and this trend is expected to continue. The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers. As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex, and could likely involve more long-term contracts than in the past. These larger customers, due to their enhanced purchasing power, may attempt to increase pressure on product pricing.
 
Health Care Reform
 
In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or together, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, mandate that all individuals have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes.  In December 2015, the former U.S. President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, which included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax such that medical device sales in 2016 and 2017 are exempt from the medical device excise tax. As part of continuing legislation signed by the U.S. President and passed by the U.S. Congress in January 2018, the medical device excise tax moratorium was further extended until January 1, 2020.
 
Initiatives to repeal the ACA, in whole or in part, to delay implementation or funding, and to offer amendments or supplements to modify its provisions have been persistent and have increased as a result of the 2016 election. Efforts to pass comprehensive repeal legislation have failed, but the outlook for ACA-compliant insurance plans is still uncertain. The current U.S. executive administration has recently begun to encourage certain alternative health plans that are not required to comply with ACA coverage standards, including short-term and association health plans. If these plans become more widespread, premiums for the more comprehensive plans required by the ACA may increase, which could result in a decrease in the number of Americans with comprehensive health care insurance.

Other Regulations 
 Our business requires us to use and store personally identifiable information of our customers, vendors, employees and business partners and, in certain instances patients treated with our products in the clinical setting. We are subject to various domestic and international privacy and security regulations, including but not limited to HIPAA and the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR. HIPAA mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, many states have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA. The GDPR is a comprehensive update to the data protection regime in the European Economic Area that is effective in fiscal 2019. The GDPR imposes new requirements relating to, among other things, consent to process personal data of individuals, the information provided to individuals regarding the processing of their personal data, the security and confidentiality of personal data, notifications in the event of data breaches and use of third party processors. If we fail to comply with these standards, we could be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and penalties for noncompliance with the GDPR. 
 We are also subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to such matters as safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research and development and manufacturing activities. Specifically, the manufacture of our biomaterials is subject to compliance with federal environmental regulations and by various state and local agencies. Although we believe we are in compliance with these laws and regulations in all material respects, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with these and other laws or regulations in the future. 
 Seasonality 
 Our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors, including new product introductions, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, patient and physician holiday schedules, and other factors. Net sales in the first half of our fiscal year were 45%, 46%, and 45% of total fiscal year net sales for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Revenues are typically lower in the first half of our fiscal year due to the seasonality of the U.S. and European markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures.
