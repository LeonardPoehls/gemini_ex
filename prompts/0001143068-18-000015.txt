Anticipated Merger with Westar Energy, Inc.
In May 2016, Great Plains Energy and Westar entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 29, 2016, by and among Great Plains Energy, Westar and GP Star, Inc. (GP Star) (Original Merger Agreement) in which Great Plains Energy would have acquired Westar for a combination of cash and shares of Great Plains Energy common stock. In April 2017, The State Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas (KCC) issued an order denying Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's and Westar's joint application for the approval of the acquisition citing concerns with the purchase price, Great Plains Energy's capital structure, quantifiable and demonstrable customer benefits and staffing levels in Westar's service territory, among other items.
In July 2017, Great Plains Energy entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July 9, 2017 by and among Great Plains Energy, Westar, Monarch Energy Holding, Inc., a Missouri corporation (Holdco), and King Energy, Inc., a Kansas corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (Merger Sub) (Amended Merger Agreement). Pursuant to the Amended Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Great Plains Energy will merge with and into Holdco, with Holdco surviving such merger, and Merger Sub will merge with and into Westar, with Westar surviving such merger. Pursuant to the Amended Merger Agreement, at closing each outstanding share of Great Plains Energy's and Westar's common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.5981 and 1.0, respectively, of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, no par value, of Holdco. Following the mergers, Holdco, with a new name that has yet to be established, will be the parent of Great Plains Energy's direct subsidiaries, including KCP&L, and Westar. 
The anticipated merger with Westar has been structured as a merger of equals in a tax-free exchange of shares that involves no premium paid or received with respect to either Great Plains Energy or Westar. Following the completion of the anticipated merger, Westar shareholders will own approximately 52.5 percent and Great Plains Energy shareholders will own approximately 47.5 percent of the combined company. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the anticipated merger with Westar.
Regulation
KCP&L and GMO are regulated by the Public Service Commission of the State of Missouri (MPSC) and KCP&L is also regulated by KCC with respect to retail rates, certain accounting matters, standards of service and, in certain cases, the issuance of securities, certification of facilities and service territories. KCP&L and GMO are also subject to regulation by The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with respect to transmission, wholesale sales and rates, and other matters. KCP&L has a 47% ownership interest in Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek), which is subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) with respect to licensing, operations and safety-related requirements. 
The table below summarizes the rate orders in effect for KCP&L's and GMO's retail rate jurisdictions.

 | Regulator | Allowed Return on Equity | Rate-Making Equity Ratio | Rate Base (in billions) | Effective Date
KCP&L Missouri | MPSC | 9.5% | 49.2% | $2.5 | June 2017 
KCP&L Kansas | KCC | 9.3% | 50.5% | $2.1 | October 2015 
GMO | MPSC | 9.5% - 9.75%(a) | (a) | (a) | February 2017 

(a) GMO's current rate order reflects a global settlement with an implied return on equity range of 9.5% - 9.75% and does not contain an agreed upon rate-making equity ratio or rate base.
Missouri and Kansas jurisdictional retail revenues averaged approximately 70% and 30%, respectively, of Electric Utility's total retail revenues over the last three years.
See Item 7 MD&A, Critical Accounting Policies section, and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning regulatory matters.

Competition 
Missouri and Kansas continue on the fully integrated and regulated retail utility model. As a result, KCP&L and GMO do not compete with others to supply and deliver electricity in its franchised service territory, although other sources of energy can provide alternatives to retail electric utility customers. If Missouri or Kansas were to pass and implement legislation authorizing or mandating retail choice, Electric Utility may no longer be able to apply regulated utility accounting principles to deregulated portions of its operations and may be required to write off certain regulatory assets and liabilities. 
Electric Utility competes in the wholesale market to sell power in circumstances when the power it generates is not required for customers in its service territory. This competition primarily occurs within the Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP) Integrated Marketplace, in which KCP&L and GMO are participants. Similar to other Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) or Independent System Operator (ISO) markets currently operating, this marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run, within the operating constraints of a unit, at any given time for maximum regional cost-effectiveness. 
In this regard, Electric Utility competes with other regional power suppliers, principally other utilities within the SPP Integrated Marketplace, on the basis of availability and price. Electric Utility's wholesale revenues averaged approximately 5% of its total revenues over the last three years.
Power Supply
Electric Utility has approximately 6,500 MWs of total owned generating capacity and also purchases power to meet its customers' needs, to satisfy firm power commitments or to meet renewable energy standards. Electric Utility's purchased power from others, as a percentage of total MWhs generated and purchased, averaged approximately 26% over the last three years. Management believes Electric Utility will be able to obtain enough power to meet its future demands due to the coordination of planning and operations in the SPP region and existing power purchase agreements; however, price and availability of power purchases may be impacted during periods of high demand. 
Electric Utility's total capacity by fuel type, including both owned generating capacity and power purchase agreements, is detailed in the table below.

Fuel Type | Estimated 2018 MW Capacity | Percent of Total Capacity
Coal | 3,433 | | 44 | %
Nuclear | 552 | | 7 | 
Natural gas and oil | 2,342 | | 30 | 
Wind (a) | 1,389 | | 18 | 
Solar, landfill gas and hydroelectric (b) | 65 | | 1 | 
Total capacity | 7,781 | | 100 | %

(a) MWs are based on nameplate capacity of the wind facility. Includes owned generating capacity of 149 MWs and long-term power purchase agreements of approximately 1,240 MWs of wind generation which expire in 2032 through 2037. 
(b) Includes a long-term power purchase agreement for approximately 60 MWs of hydroelectric generation which expires in 2023.
Electric Utility's projected peak summer demand for 2018 is approximately 5,200 MWs. Electric Utility expects to meet its projected capacity requirements for the foreseeable future with its existing generation assets and power and capacity purchases. 
KCP&L and GMO are members of the SPP. The SPP is a FERC-approved RTO with the responsibility to ensure reliable power supply, adequate transmission infrastructure and ensure competitive wholesale electricity prices in the region. As SPP members, KCP&L and GMO are required to maintain a minimum reserve margin of 12%. This net positive supply of capacity is maintained through generation asset ownership, capacity agreements, power purchase agreements and peak demand reduction programs. The reserve margin is designed to support reliability of the region's electric supply.

Fuel
The principal fuel sources for Electric Utility's owned generation are coal and nuclear fuel. It is expected, with normal weather, that approximately 98% of 2018 net MWhs generated will come from these sources with the remainder provided by wind, natural gas and oil. The actual 2017 and estimated 2018 fuel mix and delivered cost in cents per net kilowatt hour (kWh) generated are outlined in the following table. 

 | | | | | Fuel cost in cents per
 | Fuel Mix (a) | net kWh generated
 | Estimated | Actual | Estimated | Actual
Fuel | 2018 | 2017 | | 2018 | | 2017
Coal | 77 | % | 75 | % | | | 1.84 | 1.81 
Nuclear | 21 | | 23 | | | | 0.62 | 0.69 
Natural gas and oil | <1 | | 1 | | | | 7.46 | 15.19
Wind | 2 | | 1 | | | | — | — 
Total owned generation | 100 | % | 100 | % | | | 1.42 | 1.62 
(a) Fuel mix based on percent of net MWhs generated.

Coal
During 2018, Electric Utility's generating units, including jointly owned units, are projected to burn approximately 11 million tons of coal. KCP&L and GMO have entered into coal-purchase contracts with various suppliers in Wyoming's Powder River Basin (PRB), the nation's principal supply region of low-sulfur coal, and with local suppliers. The coal to be provided under these contracts is expected to satisfy approximately 95% of the projected coal requirements for 2018 and approximately 40% for 2019. The remainder of the coal requirements is expected to be fulfilled through additional contracts or spot market purchases. 
KCP&L and GMO have also entered into rail transportation contracts with various railroads to transport coal from the PRB to their generating units. The transportation services to be provided under these contracts are expected to satisfy almost all of the projected transportation requirements for 2018. The contract rates adjust for changes in railroad costs. 
Nuclear Fuel
KCP&L owns 47% of Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation (WCNOC), the operating company for Wolf Creek, which is Electric Utility's only nuclear generating unit. Wolf Creek purchases uranium and has it processed for use as fuel in its reactor. This process involves conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, enrichment of uranium hexafluoride and fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies. The owners of Wolf Creek have on hand or under contract all of the uranium and conversion services needed to operate Wolf Creek through March 2027. The owners also have under contract all of the uranium enrichment and fabrication required to operate Wolf Creek through March 2027 and September 2025, respectively. 
See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding nuclear plant.
Environmental Matters 
See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters.
