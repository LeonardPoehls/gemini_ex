Item 1. Business
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 24, 2008 as JB Clothing Corporation. Until July 10, 2009, our principal business objective was the offering of active/leisure fashion design clothing.
 
On July 10, 2009 we abandoned our efforts in the field of active/leisure fashion design clothing when we acquired 100% of the share capital of Entest BioMedical, Inc., a California corporation, (“Entest CA”) from Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, Inc. (“BMSN”) for consideration consisting of 10,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company and the cancellation of 10,000,000 shares of the Company owned and held by Mr. Rick Plote.
 
As a result of this transaction, the former stockholder of Entest CA held approximately 70% of the voting capital stock of the Company immediately after the transaction. For financial accounting purposes, this acquisition was a reverse acquisition of the Company by Entest CA under the purchase method of accounting, and was treated as a recapitalization with Entest CA as the acquirer..
 
Upon acquisition of Entest CA, we abandoned our efforts in the field of active/leisure fashion design clothing. On July 12, 2009 we adopted the name of Entest CA when we changed our name to Entest BioMedical, Inc. On June 18, 2015 Entest established Zander Therapeutics, Inc., currently a majority owned subsidiary.. We intend to engage primarily in the development and commercialization of veterinary medical therapies which we intend to license from other entities as well as develop internally

During the quarter ended November 30, 2016 Entest paid $17,000 to Regen on behalf of Zander as a partial payment of the July 15th, 2016 liability.
 On May 30, 2017 the Entest issued 83,000 shares of its Non Voting Convertible Preferred Stock on behalf of Zander to Regen in satisfaction of $83,000 of the July 15th, 2016 liability.
 On July 24th, 2017 Entest issued 102,852 shares of its Non Voting Convertible Preferred Stock on behalf of Zander to Regen in satisfaction of a $100,000 anniversary fee and $2,852 of minimum royalties payable by Zander Therapeutics pursuant to the Agreement.
 As of November 22, 2017, we have not licensed, developed or commercialized any existing veterinary medical therapies. Intellectual properties licensed to Zander by Regen Biopharma, Inc., a company under common control with us, comprise the therapeutic concept behind ZAN-100 and ZAN-200, two therapies in early stage development by Zander.
 NR2F6
 Both of Zander’s products under development will operate through either inhibition or activation by small (low molecular weight) molecules of the nuclear receptor NR2F6. Nuclear receptors are a class of proteins found within cells that are responsible for sensing certain other molecules. In response, these receptors work with other proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes.
 ZAN-100
 ZAN-100 is intended to be a veterinary cancer therapy. In the opinion of Zander, the studies performed by Hermann-Kleiter et al. (The Nuclear Orphan Receptor NR2F6 Is a Central Checkpoint for Cancer Immune Surveillance. Cell Reports 12, 2072–2085 (2015)) demonstrate that the inhibition of NR2F6 in T cells may yield anti-cancer benefits in small animals. The studies indicate that, in the presence of NR2F6, T cell activation is limited within the tumor microenvironment. Zander believes that inhibition of NR2F6 removes a barrier to the animal’s own immune system’s ability to attack cancer cells. ZAN-100 is intended to be a small molecule therapy whose mode of action will be the inhibition of NR2F6.
 High throughput screening assays conducted for Regen Biopharma, Inc. (the licensor of the intellectual property which forms the basis for Zander’s products in development) between July and September of 2016 on thirty thousand compounds yielded four newly discovered small molecule compounds which (a) can bind to the relevant structure in a cellular system and (b) show evidence of the ability to modulate the effects of NR2F6.
 ZAN-200
 ZAN-200 is intended to be a veterinary arthritis therapy. Rheumatoid arthritis is an immune-mediated disease. This means it is caused by an overreaction of the immune system. In rheumatoid arthritis, the body mistakes some of its own protein for foreign protein. It then makes antibodies against its own protein. In the opinion of Zander, suppression of the immune system through activation of NR2F6 in those immune cells would be an effective therapy. ZAN-200 is intended to operate by activating NR2F6 in the animals’ immune cells.
 Ex-vivo assays were performed using immune cells from five dog blood samples. Data derived from those tests demonstrated the ZAN-200 may inhibit T cell activation and production of cytokines, particularly IL-17 and IL-2. IL-17 and IL-2 have been shown to create inflammatory responses leading to arthritic conditions.

We have filed applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for patent protection with respect to internally developed intellectual property covering our products in development. As of November 22, 2017 no patent protection has been granted to any intellectual property developed by Zander.
 Neither of the Company or Zander has undertaken any discussions with any pharmaceutical companies regarding the commercialization of any products under development. None of Zander or the Company’s products have been approved by any regulatory body for marketing within the United States or anywhere else. No assurance can be given that all or any of Zander or the Company’s currently planned products will ever be commercialized.
 
Principal Products and Services
 
NR2F6
 Both of Zander’s products under development will operate through either inhibition or activation by small (low molecular weight) molecules of the nuclear receptor NR2F6. Nuclear receptors are a class of proteins found within cells that are responsible for sensing certain other molecules. In response, these receptors work with other proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes.
 ZAN-100
 Zander has begun development of the ZAN-100 veterinary drug line. ZAN-100 is intended to be a veterinary cancer therapy. In the opinion of Zander, the studies performed by Hermann-Kleiter et al. (The Nuclear Orphan Receptor NR2F6 Is a Central Checkpoint for Cancer Immune Surveillance. Cell Reports 12, 2072–2085 (2015)) demonstrate that the inhibition of NR2F6 in T cells may yield anti-cancer benefits in small animals.

 Development Conducted to Date
 High Throughput Screening Assay
 Initial high throughput screening assays were performed in July to September of 2016 by the contract research organization Proteros, GMBH for Regen Biopharma, Inc. This assay is based on Regen Biopharma Inc.’s screening assay whereby the full-length or ligand-binding domain of NR2F6 Reporter gene assays are used to screen for compounds that modulate gene expression via binding to nuclear hormone receptors. Transfer of this assay to ChemDiv, Inc., another contract research organization, by Regen Biopharma, Inc. was effected in January, 2017.
 
In molecular biology, a reporter gene is a gene that researchers attach to a regulatory sequence of another gene of interest in bacteria, cell culture, animals or plants. Certain genes are chosen as reporters because the characteristics they confer on organisms expressing them are easily identified and measured, or because they are selectable markers. Reporter genes are often used as an indication of whether a certain gene has been taken up by or expressed in the cell or organism population.
 
High Throughput Screens (HTS) are recent scientific methods in which hundreds of thousands of experimental samples are subjected to simultaneous testing under given conditions. Through this process one can rapidly identify active compounds, antibodies, or genes that modulate a particular biomolecular pathway. The results of these experiments provide starting points for drug design and for understanding the interaction or role of a particular biochemical process in biology.

HTS performed on behalf of Regen Biopharma, Inc. have been ongoing as of September 9, 2016. As of September 9, 2016 four newly discovered small molecule compounds which (a) can bind to the relevant structure in a cellular system and (b) show evidence of the ability to modulate activity of NR2F6 have been discovered.
 
Results of any studies conducted by Regen Biopharma, Inc. are being made available to Zander Theraputics, Inc.for use in veterinary drug development and commercialization.
 
Ex Vivo Assay
 
Ex-vivo assays were performed using immune cells from canine blood samples from five dogs. The samples were treated with compound at various concentrations and the supernatant assayed for the presence of various cytokines using ELISA-based assays. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA is a biochemical technique used mainly in immunology to detect the presence of an antibody or an antigen in a sample). These assays were commenced in May, 2017 and are ongoing as of September 9, 2017.
 
Data derived from the five dog study indicated that the ZAN-200 series drugs could inhibit T cell activation and production of cytokines, particularly IL-17 and IL-2. IL-17 and IL-2 have been shown to create inflammatory responses leading to arthritic conditions.
 Distribution methods of the products or services:
 
It is anticipated that Zander will enter into licensing and/or sublicensing agreements with outside entities in order that Zander may obtain royalty income on the products and services which it may develop and commercialize.
 
Competitive business conditions and Zander's competitive position in the industry and methods of competition
 
We have yet to achieve revenues or profits. The veterinary pharmaceutical industry in which we intend to compete are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological advancement. Many of our competitors have greater resources than we do. 
 
We intend to be competitive by utilizing the services and advice of individuals that we believe have expertise in their field in order that we can concentrate our resources on projects in which products and services in which we have the greatest potential to secure a competitive advantage  may be developed and commercialized .
 
To that effect, Zander has entered into nonemployee consulting agreements with individuals who we believe have a high level of expertise in their professional fields and who have agreed to provide counsel and assistance to Zander in (a) determining the viability of proposed projects (b) obtaining financing for projects and (c) obtaining the resources required to initiate and complete a project in the most cost effective and rapid manner.
 
These individuals are as follows:
