ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History and Organization
 
The Company was organized June 26, 2009 (Date of Inception) under the laws of the State of Nevada, as EnzymeBioSystems.
 
Our Business
 
EnzymeBioSystems researches specialty enzymes and enzyme related products.
 
We utilize enzyme technologies to develop commercial solutions for a broad range of applications within the specialty chemical industry. These markets are largely served by a small number of large, well-established businesses and research university centers. We plan to work collaboratively with those industrial companies to develop differentiated, high performance enzyme solutions for their target markets, and to leverage their well-developed distribution capabilities to better exploit commercial opportunities. Our enzyme technology will tie-in with development of new commercial biological active compounds. We hope we can develop specialty enzymes to eliminate the side effects and toxicity of the new commercially developed products.
Enzyme Industry
 
Enzymes can be categorized as “enzyme inhibitors” and “enzyme activators.” Enzyme inhibitors are molecules that bind to enzymes and decrease their activity. Since blocking an enzyme’s activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many drugs are enzyme inhibitors. Enzyme activators are molecules that bind to enzymes and increase their activity. These molecules are often involved in the allosteric [defined as having to do with a protein with a structure that is altered reversibly by a small molecule so that its original function is modified] regulation of enzymes in the control of metabolism. Both enzyme inhibitors and enzyme activators are currently used by many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in research and development of new drug compounds.

Enzymes also can be used as pharmaceutical products. Enzymes as pharmaceuticals have two important features that distinguish them from all other types of pharmaceutical products. First, enzymes often bind and act on their targets with great affinity and specificity. Second, enzymes are catalytic and convert multiple target molecules to the desired products. These two features make for what are considered specialized enzymes that can accomplish therapeutic biochemistry in the body that small molecules cannot. These characteristics have resulted in the development of many enzyme drugs for a wide range of disorders, e.g. insulin and interferon.
 
Business Strategy
 
We foresee that our two areas of business opportunity, include: 1) buying raw materials to produce specialty enzymes in contract lab facilities; 2) contracting with CRO’s with the goal to obtain FDA approval to further test the enzymes.
 
We plan to deploy our enzyme technologies across diverse markets that represent commercial opportunities in helping us build visibility for EnzymeBioSystems. This includes building our reputation in the scientific community through trade publications and protecting our intellectual property and technology through the patent process.
 
We plan to use enzyme technologies to develop commercial solutions for a broad range of applications within the specialty chemical industry. These markets are largely served by a small number of large, well-established businesses and research university centers.
 
Through contract laboratories we currently have only limited resources and capability to develop, manufacture, or distribute specialty enzyme products on a limited scale. We will determine which specialty enzyme products to pursue independently based on various criteria, including: investment required, estimated time to market, regulatory hurdles, infrastructure requirements, and industry-specific expertise necessary for successful commercialization. At any time, we may modify our strategy and pursue collaborations for the development and commercialization of some specialty enzyme products that we had intended to pursue independently. In order for us to commercialize more specialty enzyme products directly, we plan to establish or obtain through outsourcing arrangements additional capability to develop, manufacture, market, sell, and distribute such products.

Our Business Strategy
 
Management is evaluating an enzyme compound which it believes has a specific therapeutic value in fighting tumors, specifically breast tumors. Management has undertaken research to study its synthetic Amooranin compound, which the Company has developed in-house. Studies of Amooranin have already been completed in rats. Further, research is required to study Amooranin in a different animal species.
 
Amooranin is a triterpene acid with a novel structure isolated from the stem bark of Amoora rohituka, a tropical tree growing wild in India. Studies have demonstrated that multiple breast cancer cell lines respond to Amooranin in growth suppression assays. Mechanistic studies suggest that Amooranin suppresses growth factor signaling, induces cell cycle arrest, and promotes apoptosis. This is because the anti-neoplastic activity of the plant-derived compound of Amooranin is relatively weak.
 
Our founder developed a new synthetic analogue of this molecule by chemical transformations in an attempt to identify a more potent agent. One of these analogues, Amooranin-Me, was found to inhibit proliferation of several breast cancer cells with greater potency than the parent compound of Amooranin. Preliminary screening of Amooranin-Me in in-vitro experiments revealed some potenecy against breast cancer MCF-7 cells with concentrations down to the nanomolar range. All these studies indicate that Amooranin-Me is a promising drug with potential to be used for human breast cancer prevention.
 
The Company has moved further along with the process of evaluating an enzyme compound which they believe has specific therapeutic value in fighting tumors. In an effort to evaluate this compound, management has had a series of meetings with various contract research organizations to enlist their expertise in performing animal studies. The research will study the use of an antitumor natural product called amooranin. Specifically, the two areas of this study will include: 1) an exam of the in vitro cytotoxicity of amooranin against hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and 2) investigate the dose responsive antitumor actions of amooranin against chemically induced hepatic tumorgenesis in rats and dogs.
 
Management wants to continue its research with Amooranin that will lead to the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) with the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. It is still too early to determine if this project has any potential value for the Company, and there are no assurances that the Company will ever be able to obtain an IND for this compound.
 
As of the date of this report, management of the Company has identified an independent chemical laboratory that can produce sufficient quantities of amooranin to proceed with the required animal studies. A small preclinical batch of methyl amooranin has been manufactured by the independent chemical laboratory. This preclinical batch is not large enough to sufficiently test in several animal studies needed to obtain an IND.

Competition
 
Our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do and may succeed in developing products that would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in their respective fields. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner and are technologically superior to, and/or are less expensive than, other products on the market. Current competitors or other companies may develop technologies and products that are more effective than ours. Our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors. The existing approaches of our competitors or new approaches or technology developed by our competitors may be more effective than those developed by us.
 
Any enzyme products that we develop will compete in multiple, highly competitive markets. For example, Codexis, Maxygen, Inc., Evotec, and Xencor have alternative evolution technologies. Integrated Genomics Inc., Myriad Genetics, Inc., and ArQule, Inc. perform screening, sequencing, and/or bioinformatics services. Novozymes A/S, Verenium Corporation, Genencor International Inc. and MPBiomedicals are involved in development, over expression, fermentation, and purification of enzymes. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than we do. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are access to genetic material, technological experience and expertise, and proprietary position.
 
EnzymeBioSystems’ Funding Requirements
 
Future funding could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Any future acquisitions of other businesses, technologies, services or product(s) might require the Company to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which might not be available on terms favorable to the Company, or at all, and such financing, if available, might be dilutive.

Patent, Trademark, License and Franchise Restrictions and Contractual Obligations and Concessions
 
We do not have any trademarks. In 2012, the two founders of the Company, along with a third party, as inventors, filed Patent Application # 14/369339 entitled “Amooranin Compounds and Analogs Thereof and Related Methods of Use.” The U.S. Patent Office informed us that they published the aforementioned pending Patent on December 4, 2014 (Publication No. 2014-0357711A1).
 
On September 28, 2017, we received a Notice of Allowance from the U.S. Patent Office that they approved the Company’s Patent Application #14/369339. A Notice of Allowance is issued by the United States Patent & Trademark Office to indicate that it believes an invention qualifies for a patent. The patent is not fully protected until it completes the final patent process and pays the appropriate fees. We are currently in the process of paying the final patent fees. As added disclosure, an invention is still considered “patent pending” until the final patent has been issued.
 
We plan to rely on trade secrets, technical know-how, and continuing invention to develop and maintain our competitive position. We will take security measures to protect our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and technologies, and confidential data and continue to explore further methods of protection. Our policy is to execute confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants upon the commencement of an employment or consulting arrangement with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual’s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property.
 
Research and Development Activities and Costs
 
Research and development expenses related to our specialty enzyme business include costs related to ongoing bioprocess development and manufacturing process yield improvements. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company spent $0 and $11,080, respectively, in product research and development.
Effect of Government Regulation on Business
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and the health and safety of our employees.

Non-drug biologically derived products, such as the specialty enzymes we plan to produce are regulated in the United States based on their application, by either the United States Food and Drug Administration, (“FDA”), the Environmental Protection Agency, (“EPA”) in the case of plants and animals, or the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). In addition to regulating drugs, the FDA also regulates food and food additives, feed and feed additives, and Generally Recognized As Safe substances used in the processing of food. The EPA regulates biologically derived chemicals not within the FDA’s jurisdiction. Although the food and industrial regulatory process can vary significantly in time and expense from application to application, the timelines generally are shorter in duration than the drug regulatory process.
 
In the United States, transgenic agricultural products may be reviewed by the FDA, EPA, and USDA, depending on the plant and the trait engineered into it. The regulatory process for these agricultural products can take up to five years of field testing under USDA oversight, and up to another two years for applicable agencies to complete their reviews. At this time, we do not anticipate producing any enzymes that would require FDA approval. Our processes would include combining enzymes that have already been approved the FDA.
 
Even after investing significant time and expenditures, we may not obtain regulatory approval for our enzyme products that incorporate technologies that have not been approved for commercialization in the United States or elsewhere. For example, the EPA regulates biologically derived chemical substances not within the FDA’s jurisdiction. An unfavorable EPA ruling could delay commercialization or require modification of the production process resulting in higher manufacturing costs, thereby making the product uneconomical. In addition, the USDA may prohibit genetically engineered plants from being grown and transported except under an exemption, or under controls so burdensome that commercialization becomes impracticable. Our future products may not be exempted by the USDA. In addition, new laws, new interpretations of existing laws, increased governmental enforcement of environmental laws, or other developments could require us to make additional significant expenditures.
 
We will be subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and health and safety issues.
 
Outside of the United States, scientifically-based standards, guidelines and recommendations pertinent to transgenic and other products intended for the international marketplace are being developed by, among others, the representatives of national governments within the jurisdiction of the standard-setting bodies, including Codex Alimentarius, the International Plant Protection Convention, and the Office des International Epizooties. The use of the existing standard-setting bodies to address concerns about products of biotechnology is intended to harmonize risk-assessment methodologies and evaluation of specific products or classes of products.

In the future we may be subject to additional laws, regulations, policies, approvals and the like of federal, state, local, municipal, foreign and other bodies.
 
Compliance With Environmental Laws
 
We seek to comply with all applicable statutory and administrative requirements concerning environmental quality. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures for environmental compliance and protection. Expenditures for compliance with environmental laws have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operation or competitive position.
Employees
 
The Company currently has: two officers and one director. These individuals perform all of the job functions for the Company. The Company has no intention at this time to add employees until it can become a profitable entity. The Company from time to time may retain independent consultants in connection with its operations.

(i) | The Company’s performance is dependent on the performance of its officers. In particular, the Company’s success depends on their ability to develop a business strategy which will be successful for the Company. 
------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | The Company does not carry key person life insurance on any of its personnel. The loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The Company’s future success also depends on its ability to retain and attract highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. 
(iii) | There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain its key managerial and technical personnel or that it will be able to attract and retain additional highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future. The inability to attract and retain the technical and managerial personnel necessary to support the growth of the Company’s business, due to, among other things, a large increase in the wages demanded by such personnel, could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
