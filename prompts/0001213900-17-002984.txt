Business Summary
 
Since its formation in 1988, CES has been providing asbestos abatement, demolition, and mold remediation services to city, state, and federal agencies. Additional customers of CES include general contractors, developers, project owners, and industrial and commercial clients. Much of our work has been founded on the removal of hazardous materials from structures ranging from residences to commercial and industrial applications, including secure defense contractor facilities, colleges, hospitals, and mid-rise and high-rise buildings and residential structures. Additionally, our experience working on federal projects, such as the Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management Promiscuous Dump Clean Up, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Midway Atoll Asbestos and Lead Paint Cleanup, and Department of Defense Military Housing Privatization Initiative, gives us the expertise to provide the submittals and mandated government compliance documents for any size federal project.
Background
 
Since its formation in 1988, Cross Environmental Services, Inc. (“CES”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been providing asbestos abatement, demolition, and mold remediation services to city, state, and federal agencies. Our customers include general contractors, developers, project owners, and industrial and commercial clients. Much of CES’s work has been founded on the removal of hazardous materials from structures ranging from residences to commercial and industrial applications, including secure defense contractor facilities, colleges, hospitals, and mid-rise and high-rise buildings and residential structures. Additionally, its experience working on federal projects, such as the Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management Promiscuous Dump Clean Up, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Midway Atoll Asbestos and Lead Paint Cleanup, and Department of Defense Military Housing Privatization Initiative, gives CES the expertise to provide the submittals and mandated government compliance documents for any size federal project.
 
CES removes regulated and hazardous materials from industrial, commercial and residential spaces. Specifically, it has developed a niche market for its services that was facilitated by the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or NESHAP, regulations. Under these regulations, if a building or structure is altered, modified or renovated in any way, an environmental survey of the building must be completed and regulated hazardous materials (asbestos) must be removed prior to the alteration or renovation. CES provides such services to its clients.
 
CES also provides services related to the asbestos removal process including interior demolition, lead-based paint removal, mold abatement, and full-scale structural demolition. CES is also adept at materials handling and it has participated in emergency response activities for multiple hurricanes, including Katrina, Rita, Gene, Francis, Ivan, and many others. CES has been able to develop niche markets by maintaining a high level of technical competence coupled with prudent management and an energetic staff. It is willing to go to remote or extreme places to complete projects. Examples of locations at which CES performs this type of work include Midway Atoll, GITMO, Curacao, Guatemala, and remote Bahamian Islands. It has also developed niches providing services in connection with various set-asides under federal law, including Economically Disadvantaged Woman Owned Business, HUBZone, Veteran Owned, and Total Small Business. CES has strategic alliances relating to all of such set-asides and have utilized these alliances to generate projects. 
 
CES has an established operating infrastructure, with numerous long-term contracts, blanket purchase orders, and ongoing relationships with a robust customer base.
 
CES’s management and employees are very experienced and expert in their trades. CES has ten project managers who have over 200 combined years of experience. All are skilled in project set-up, permitting, submittals, scheduling, and project close-out.

In addition to the tools made available to its project managers, CES has a highly skilled staff of field personnel. CES has multiple field superintendents and supervisors who have fifteen to twenty years’ experience. Many of these people have been with CES since its inception. Its field supervisory staff has, in the aggregate, over 200 man-years of experience. We believe that almost as important as the project personnel and related experience, is having modern late model equipment to work with. CES has an extensive late-model fleet of service trucks, box trucks, vans, excavators, loaders, dump trucks, semi tractors, and roll off trucks that can be deployed to any project. In addition to the large rolling stock and excavators, it has an extensive inventory of specialty equipment designed to provide demolition and abatement services inside a structure. This equipment includes but is not limited to skid steer loaders equipped with exhaust scrubbers, mini excavators equipped with hydraulic hammers, automated tile removing machines, airless sprayers, and various handheld power tools designed for material removal.
 
Customers 
 
CES’s target market includes commercial, industrial, federal, state and municipal entities. Given the strict requirements for control of infectious dust and other engineered controls in healthcare facilities (active hospitals), targets include open and active facilities that have stringent control components similar to and including healthcare facilities. Additional examples of prospective clients include the Department of Transportation, due to the importance of infrastructure improvement, and the ongoing need for roadway construction and related bridge construction.
 
In 2016, Corvias and Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) accounted for 12.1% and 10.5% of revenue respectively. In 2015, Renu Asset Recovery and FDOT accounted for 13.9% and 15.2% of revenue, respectively.
 
Services Strategy
 
The Company offers services in the environmental contracting arena. Its core business includes hazardous material removal (lead and asbestos), interior demolition, full scale demolition, and mold remediation. Historically, its customers have been acquired either through a low bid environment or through direct negotiations.
 
The Company believes that set-aside government contracting is an additional growth opportunity. It has participated in this sector of the federal market by teaming with firms that have the various set-aside designations.
 
Effects of Seasonality and Economic Uncertainty
 
The Company may be subject to seasonal fluctuations and construction cycles at educational institutions, where large projects are typically carried out during summer months when their facilities are unoccupied. Government customers, many of which have fiscal years that do not coincide with ours, typically follow annual procurement cycles and appropriate funds on a fiscal-year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Further, government contracting cycles can be affected by the timing of, and delays in, the legislative process related to government programs and incentives that help drive demand for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. As a result, the Company’s revenue and operating income in the third quarter are typically higher, and revenue and operating income in the first quarter are typically lower, than in other quarters of the year. As a result of such fluctuations, the Company may occasionally experience declines in revenue or earnings as compared to the immediately preceding quarter, and comparisons of operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful.
Backlog and Awarded Projects
 
The Company’s sales cycle begins with the initial contact with the customer and ends, when successful, with a signed contract, also referred to as fully-contracted backlog. Historically, the sales cycle typically averages 30 days. Awarded backlog is created when a potential customer awards a project following a request for proposal. Once a project is awarded but not yet contracted, the Company typically conducts a detailed review to determine the scope of the project. At this point, it also determines the sub-contractor, and what equipment will be used. Historically, awarded projects typically have taken 45 days to result in a signed contract and thus convert to fully-contracted backlog. This process may take longer, however, depending upon the size and complexity of the project. Further, at times in the past the Company has experienced periods during which the portion of the sales cycle for converting awarded project to signed contracts has lengthened. Recently, the Company has been experiencing an unusually sustained lengthening of conversion times. Continued U.S. federal fiscal uncertainty not only has contributed to a lengthening of the Company’s sales cycle for U.S. federal projects, but also has adversely affected both municipal and commercial customers across most geographic regions. The Company has observed among its existing and prospective customer base increased scrutiny of decisions about spending and about incurring debt to finance projects. For example, it has observed increased use of outside consultants and advisors, as well as adoption of additional approval steps, by many of its customers, which has resulted in a lengthening of the sales cycle. The Company expects this trend to continue in 2017. After the customer agrees to the terms of the contract and the contract is executed, the project moves to fully-contracted backlog. The contracts reflected in the Company’s fully-contracted backlog typically have a construction period of 30-45 days and the Company typically expect to recognize revenue for such contracts over the same period. Fully-contracted backlog begins converting into revenue generated from backlog on a percentage-of-completion basis once construction has commenced.

Facilities and Assets
 
In addition to the contract acquisition approach defined above, the Company anticipates expansion of services, facilities, and assets to increase profitability. Specifically, the Company plans to expand its sales footprint into additional areas outside of the state of Florida, and to focus on maintaining its core business lines in additional markets.  
Business Model
 
The Company intends to continue to operate in 2017 with a reduced overhead and a focus on profitability. It will continue to prepare sealed bids for municipal, county, state, and federal projects. It will still respond to invitations to bid from private and public entities. All of the systems and processes are in place to facilitate these ongoing procurement procedures. The Company plans to expand its systems to seek projects in a larger geographic area and for a larger customer base.
Competition
 
Companies that compete with us both locally and on a national level include, but are not limited to, Cross Construction Services, Lang Environmental, and Northstar. The Company believes that it has several competitive advantages. The Company has many employees who have been with it since or close to its inception. Company staff is very experienced and efficient. The Company makes it a point to keep key employees on staff and current with ongoing training. The Company believes its work force is one of the most experienced and well-trained in the industry. The Company’s management staff possesses over 200 years of combined experience. The Company believes it has an edge over its competitors in terms of experience and technical ability.
 
The Company specifically targets projects with robust requirements in tough locations because it has the experience and resources available to see them to fruition. Additionally, these projects are more profitable. The Company believes in long-term relationships and work to facilitate projects with its customers. The Company believes that its ability to complete complex projects and to service its customers on a long-term basis through difficult economic times gives it a strategic advantage over some of its competitors.
 
Government Regulations
 
The Company is subject to an extensive and frequently changing statutory and regulatory framework of federal, state, and local environmental, health, safety, and transportation authorities, which imposes significant compliance burdens and risks upon us. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all material federal, state, and local laws governing its material business operations. Nevertheless, amendments to existing statutes and regulations, adoption of new statutes and regulations and the Company’s expansion into other jurisdictions and types of operations could result not only in the additional risk of noncompliance, but also in an increase in regulatory burdens that could cause related increases in costs and expenses.
 
The federal regulations of most importance to us are governed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Transportation, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Company is also significantly impacted by environmental regulations governed by state environmental protection agencies. The Company believes that it is substantially in compliance with all material regulations. The Company conducts training programs and inspections on a regular basis. In addition, its brokers and insurance carriers also conduct inspections.
 
Permits and Licenses
 
Many states license such areas of Company operations as asbestos abatement and general contracting.  In such states, employees and supervisors are required to receive training from EPA-approved and state-certified organizations and pass required tests. The Company is currently licensed to perform services in approximately 12 states.  The Company also operates in certain states that do not have special asbestos abatement or general contracting license requirements; however, these states have adopted regulations regarding worker safety with which the Company must comply.
Employees
 
As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company had 124 employees, all of whom work full time.
