Item 1. Business.
 
Following the execution of Mutual Rescission Agreement with Shenzhen Jinke Energy Development Co., Ltd. on November 15, 2016, the Company has become an investment holding company without significant assets or operations.
 
CORPORATE HISTORY AND STRUCTURE
 
We were incorporated as Avalon Development Enterprises, Inc. on March 29, 1999, under the laws of the State of Florida.  From inception until January 2007, we engaged in the business of acquiring commercial property and expanding into building cleaning, maintenance services, and equipment leasing as supporting ancillary services and sources of revenue. On January 10, 2007, the Company, Global Telecom Holdings, Ltd., a British Virgin Islands company ("GTHL"), and the shareholders of GTHL, entered into a share exchange agreement, pursuant to which the Company issued 39,817,500 shares of its restricted common stock to the shareholders of GTHL in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of GTHL.  Following the transaction on March 27, 2007, GTHL became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we changed our name to Guangzhou Global Telecom Holdings, Inc. and succeeded to the business of GTHL.
 
In 2007, we established four subsidiaries; namely, Zhengzhou Global Telecom Equipment Limited ("ZGTE"), Macau Global Telecom Company Limited ("MGT"), Huantong Telecom Hongkong Holding Limited ("HTHKH"), and Huantong Telecom Singapore Company PTE Limited ("HTS") with capital of RMB 500,000, Macau Dollar 300,000, Hong Kong Dollar 100 and Singapore Dollar 200,000, respectively. Simultaneously, we established a subsidiary; namely, Guangzhou Huantong Telecom Technology and Consultant Services, Ltd ("GHTTCS") with capital of RMB 8,155,730. Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated April 9, 2008 and July 29, 2008, respectively, the Company acquired 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of Beijing Lihe Jiahua Technology and Trading Company Ltd ("BLJ") for a consideration of US$300,000 and 51% of the issued and outstanding shares in Guangzhou Renwoxing Telecom Co., Ltd. ("GRT"), a limited liability company incorporated in China for a consideration of US$291,833.
 
In 2009 and 2010, the Company disposed of its subsidiaries CHTTCS, ZGTE, MGT and BLJ due to their loss in operations. HTHKH and HTS were not able to commence operations since its inception, so the Company deregistered them in 2010.
 

Acquisition of China Teletech Limited
 
On March 30, 2012, the Company completed a share exchange transaction with China Teletech Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation ("CTL") and the former shareholders of CTL.
 
CTL is a British Virgin Islands Company, incorporated on January 30, 2008 under the British Virgin Islands Business Act 2004.  Its primary business operations were concluded through two wholly owned subsidiaries located in China, namely, (a) Shenzhen Rongxin Investment Co., Ltd. ("Shenzhen Rongxin") and (b) Guangzhou Rongxin Science and Technology Limited ("Guangzhou Rongxin").

Pursuant to a share exchange agreement dated March 20, 2012 among CTL, its former shareholders and us, we acquired all the outstanding capital stock of CTL from its former shareholders of CTL in exchange for 40,000,000 shares of our common stock. The shares issued to the former shareholders of CTL constituted approximately 68.34% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock immediately after the commutation of the share exchange transaction. As a result of the share exchange, CTL became our wholly owned subsidiary and Dong Liu and Yuan Zhao, the former shareholders of CTL, became our principal shareholders.
 
In connection with the share exchange, Yankuan Li resigned as our Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Chairman of the Board of Directors, effective on March 30, 2012. On the same day, Dong Liu, Yuan Zhao, Yau Kwong Lee and Kwok Ming Wai Andrew were appointed as our directors, effective immediately. Ms. Yankuan Li remained  President, Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors of the Company. As of result of the merger, the Company believed that it could enjoy a greater management and capital resources and have a greater network and business opportunities. The Company expected to be able to expand its telecommunications business in Guangzhou and Shenzhen cities in China.
 
Sale of the Company's Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, Guangzhou Global Telecommunication Company Limited
 
On June 30, 2012, we entered into a Sales and Purchase Agreement with Mr. Zhu Sui Hui ("Mr. Hui") pursuant to which we sold all the capital stock of Guangzhou Global Telecommunication Company Limited ("GGT"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, to Mr. Hui for RMB 5,000, or approximately $800. Both parties agreed unconditionally to waive the current accounts payable or receivable balances between the Company (and its subsidiaries) and GGT. GGT was engaged in the trading and distribution of cellular phones and accessories, prepaid calling cards, and rechargeable store-value cards before the sale.

Share Exchange with Jinke
 
On January 28, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Shenzhen Jinke Energy Development Co., Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“Jinke”), and Guangyuan Liu, the holder of 97% of the equity interest of Jinke, pursuant to which we acquired 51% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Jinke (the “Share Exchange”). Both the Company and Jinke believed that the acquisition transaction is in the best interest of their respective shareholders. The Company believed that the acquisition would enhance the value of the Company through the acquisition of a majority equity interest in Jinke’s viable business, and Jinke believes that such transaction will afford Jinke access to the U.S. capital market and other possible financial resources. Prior to the execution of the Cooperation Agreement, there was no material relationship between the company and its affiliates and JinKe and its affiliates=. Jinke was introduced to the Company by Ms. Chen Xiaoqiao, a PRC resident, who is a mutual business contact of Ms. Li Yankuan, the Company’s CEO and Mr. Liu Guangyuan, Jinke’s former owner. For her role in this, Ms. Chen received 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock subsequent to the closing of the acquisition. Other than the foregoing, no third party played a material role in arranging or facilitating the acquisition.
 
The Company and Jinke had previously entered into a certain cooperation agreement  on June 30, 2014. The Cooperation Agreement was superseded and replaced by the Share Exchange Agreement by and between the Company and Jinke, dated as of January 28, 2015. The parties decided to change from an asset purchase to a share purchase primarily due to the difficulty in ascertaining Jinke’s assets to be acquired based on the percentages as set forth in the previous cooperation agreement. In connection with the Share Exchange, the cooperation agreement dated June 30, 2014 into which Jinke and the Company previously entered, and which was first disclosed on the Company’s current report on Form 8-K filed August 8, 2014, was terminated and superseded in its entirety by the Share Exchange Agreement.
