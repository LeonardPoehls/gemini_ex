ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
The Company
Stone Energy is an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, exploitation, development and operation of oil and gas properties. We have been operating in the Gulf of Mexico (the "GOM") Basin since our incorporation in 1993 and have established a technical and operational expertise in this area. We have leveraged our experience in the GOM conventional shelf and expanded our reserve base into the more prolific basins of the GOM deep water, Gulf Coast deep gas and the Marcellus and Utica shales in Appalachia. As of December 31, 2016, our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were approximately 53 MMBoe or 321 Bcfe. In connection with our restructuring efforts, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell all of our Appalachia Properties (as defined in Reorganization and Chapter 11 Proceedings – Purchase and Sale Agreement below). We expect to close the sale of the Appalachia Properties by February 28, 2017, subject to customary closing conditions, after which we will no longer have operations or assets in Appalachia.
We were incorporated in 1993 as a Delaware corporation. Our corporate headquarters are located at 625 E. Kaliste Saloom Road, Lafayette, Louisiana 70508. We have additional offices in New Orleans, Louisiana, Houston, Texas and Morgantown, West Virginia.
Business Strategy
Our long-term strategy is to grow net asset value through acquiring, discovering, developing and operating a focused set of margin-advantaged properties while appropriately managing financial, exploration and operational risk. During the second half of 2014, commodity prices began a substantial decline, which continued throughout 2015 and 2016. In response to that decline and the uncertainty regarding future commodity prices, we adjusted our near-term strategy to focus on maintaining maximum liquidity, which included reductions in capital expenditures in 2016 and the shut-in of our Mary field in Appalachia from September 2015 until late June 2016. In March 2016, we retained financial and legal advisors to assist the Company in analyzing and considering financial, transactional and strategic alternatives.
Overview
The lower commodity prices from mid-2014 through 2016 resulted in reduced revenue and cash flows and have negatively impacted our liquidity position. Additionally, the level of our indebtedness and the current commodity price environment have presented challenges as they relate to our ability to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, we had total indebtedness of $1,427.8 million, including $300 million of 1¾% Senior Convertible Notes due in March 2017 (the "2017 Convertible Notes"), $775 million of 7½% Senior Notes due in 2022 (the "2022 Notes"), $341.5 million outstanding under our bank credit facility and $11.3 million outstanding under our 4.20% Building Loan (the "Building Loan"). Additionally, we had $35.2 million of accrued interest payable on our outstanding indebtedness.
In response to the significant decline in commodity prices, we focused on managing our balance sheet during 2016 to preserve liquidity during this extended low commodity price environment by taking certain steps, including reductions in capital expenditures and the termination and renegotiation of various contracts, reductions in workforce and reductions in discretionary expenditures. Additionally, in March 2016, we retained financial and legal advisors to assist the Company in analyzing and considering financial, transactional and strategic alternatives. We engaged in negotiations with financial advisors for the holders of the 2017 Convertible Notes and 2022 Notes regarding the restructuring of the notes and with our banks regarding an amendment to our bank credit facility.
On March 10, 2016, we borrowed $385 million under our bank credit facility, which at the time, represented substantially all of the undrawn amount on our $500 million bank credit facility. On April 13, 2016, the borrowing base under our bank credit facility was reduced by the lenders from $500 million to $300 million. On that date, we had $457 million of outstanding borrowings and $18.3 million of outstanding letters of credit under the bank credit facility, resulting in a $175.3 million borrowing base 
1

deficiency. In June 2016, however, we entered into Amendment No. 3 (the "June Amendment") to our bank credit facility which, among other things, resulted in an increase of our borrowing base from $300 million to $360 million and relaxed certain financial covenants through December 31, 2016. In addition, the June Amendment required that we maintain minimum liquidity (as defined in the June Amendment) of $125.0 million through January 15, 2017, imposed limitations on capital expenditures from June to December 2016 and provided for anti-hoarding cash provisions for amounts in excess of $50.0 million beginning after December 10, 2016. Upon execution of the June Amendment, we repaid the balance of our borrowing base deficiency, resulting in approximately $360 million outstanding under the credit facility at that time. In December 2016, we reached agreements with the banks to extend the effective date of the anti-hoarding cash provisions to December 15, 2016.
In June 2016, we terminated our deep water drilling rig contract with Ensco for total consideration of $20 million. Additionally, we entered into an interim Appalachian midstream contract with Williams at the Mary field in Appalachia, whereby we elected to resume production at the Mary field, which had been shut-in since September 2015. In August 2016, we paid $7.5 million for the early terminations of an Appalachian drilling rig contract and a contract with an offshore vessel provider.
As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under the bank credit facility and the indentures governing our notes, however, we anticipated that the minimum liquidity requirement and other restrictions under the June Amendment would prevent us from being able to meet our interest payment obligation on the 2022 Notes in the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as the subsequent maturity of our 2017 Convertible Notes on March 1, 2017. As a result of these conditions, continued decreases in commodity prices and the significant level of our indebtedness, we continued to work with our financial and legal advisors throughout 2016 to structure a plan of reorganization to improve our financial position and liquidity and allow for growth and long-term success. On December 14, 2016, we filed for bankruptcy.
Reorganization and Chapter 11 Proceedings
On December 14, 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries Stone Energy Offshore, L.L.C. ("Stone Offshore") and Stone Energy Holding, L.L.C. (together with the Company, the "Debtors") filed voluntary petitions for reorganization (the "Bankruptcy Petitions") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the "Bankruptcy Court") seeking relief under the provisions of Chapter 11 of Title 11 ("Chapter 11") of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"). On February 15, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the "Confirmation Order"), confirming the Company's plan of reorganization (the "Plan"), as modified by the Confirmation Order. We expect the Plan to become effective on February 28, 2017, at which point the Debtors would emerge from bankruptcy, however, there can be no assurance that the effectiveness of the Plan will occur on such date, or at all.
During the bankruptcy proceedings, the Debtors are operating as "debtors-in-possession" in accordance with applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Court granted all first day motions filed by the Debtors, allowing the Company to operate its business in the ordinary course throughout the bankruptcy process. The first day motions included, among other things, a cash collateral motion, a motion maintaining the Company's existing cash management system and motions making various vendor payments, wage payments and tax payments in the ordinary course of business. Subject to certain exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the Chapter 11 filings automatically stayed most judicial or administrative actions against the Debtors or their property to recover, collect or secure a pre-petition claim. This prohibits, for example, our lenders or noteholders from pursuing claims for defaults under our debt agreements.
Restructuring Support Agreement. Prior to filing the Bankruptcy Petitions, on October 20, 2016, the Debtors entered into a restructuring support agreement (the "Original RSA") with certain holders of the 2017 Convertible Notes and the 2022 Notes (collectively, the "Notes" and the holders thereof, the "Noteholders") to support a restructuring on the terms of the Plan. On November 17, 2016, the Debtors commenced a solicitation to seek acceptance by a majority of those voting in each voting class of claims of the Company’s creditors under the Plan, including the lenders (the "Banks") under the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 24, 2014, as amended, modified, or otherwise supplemented from time to time (the "Credit Facility"), and the Noteholders. On December 14, 2016, the Debtors, the Noteholders holding approximately 79.7% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes and the Banks holding 100% of the aggregate principal amount owing under the Credit Facility entered into an Amended and Restated Restructuring Support Agreement (the "A&R RSA") that amended, superseded and restated in its entirety the Original RSA. In connection with entry into the A&R RSA and the commencement of the bankruptcy cases, the Debtors amended the Plan. The solicitation period ended on December 16, 2016 and (i) of the 94.24% of Noteholders in aggregate outstanding principal amount that voted, 99.95% voted in favor of the Plan and .05% voted to reject the Plan, and (ii) 100% of the Banks voted to accept the Plan. 
Additionally, on December 16, 2016, an ad hoc group of certain of the Company's stockholders (the "Stockholder Ad Hoc Group") filed a motion (the "Equity Committee Motion") to appoint an official committee of equity security holders in connection with the Debtors' Chapter 11 proceedings. On December 21, 2016, the Company reached a settlement agreement with the Stockholder Ad Hoc Group (the "Settlement") and on December 28, 2016, the Plan was amended. 
2

Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, as amended, to be consistent with the terms of the A&R RSA and the term sheet annexed to the A&R RSA (the "Term Sheet") and as amended pursuant to the Settlement, the Noteholders will receive their pro rata share of (a) $100 million of cash, (b) 95% of the common stock in reorganized Stone and (c) $225 million of new 7.5% second lien notes due 2022 (the "Second Lien Notes"). The Banks will receive their respective pro rata share of commitments and obligations under an amended credit agreement (the "Amended Credit Facility") on the terms set forth in Exhibit 1(a) to the Term Sheet, as well as their respective share of the Company’s unrestricted cash, as of the effective date of the Plan, in excess of $25 million, net of certain fees, payments, escrows or distributions pursuant to the Plan and the PSA (as defined below). Existing common stockholders of Stone will receive their pro rata share of 5% of the common stock in reorganized Stone and warrants for ownership of up to 15% of reorganized Stone's common equity exercisable upon the Company reaching certain benchmarks pursuant to the terms of the new warrants, which may be exercised any time prior to the fourth anniversary of the Plan's effective date, unless terminated earlier by their terms upon the consummation of certain business combinations or sale transactions involving the Company. All claims of creditors with unsecured claims other than claims by the Noteholders, including vendors, shall be unaltered and will be paid in full in the ordinary course of business to the extent such claims are undisputed. Each of the foregoing common equity percentages in reorganized Stone is subject to dilution from the exercise of the new warrants described above and a management incentive plan. Assuming implementation of the Plan, Stone expects that it will eliminate approximately $1.2 billion in principal amount of outstanding debt.
Purchase and Sale Agreement. The A&R RSA contained certain covenants on the part of the Company and the Noteholders and Banks who are signatories to the A&R RSA, including that such Noteholders and Banks would support the Company's sale of Stone's producing properties and acreage, including approximately 86,000 net acres, in the Appalachia regions of Pennsylvania and West Virginia (the "Appalachia Properties") to TH Exploration III, LLC, an affiliate of Tug Hill, Inc. ("Tug Hill"), pursuant to the terms of a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated October 20, 2016, as amended on December 9, 2016 (the "Tug Hill PSA"), and otherwise facilitate the restructuring transaction, in each case subject to certain terms and conditions in the A&R RSA. The consummation of the Plan is subject to customary conditions and other requirements, as well as the sale by Stone of the Appalachia Properties, for a purchase price of at least $350 million and approval of the Bankruptcy Court. Pursuant to the terms of the Tug Hill PSA, Stone agreed to sell the Appalachia Properties to Tug Hill for $360 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments.
Pursuant to Bankruptcy Court orders dated January 11, 2017 and January 31, 2017, two additional bidders were allowed to participate in competitive bidding on the Appalachia Properties. On January 18, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court approved certain bidding procedures (the "Bidding Procedures") in connection with the sale of the Appalachia Properties. In accordance with the Bidding Procedures, Stone conducted an auction for the sale of the Appalachia Properties on February 8, 2017 and upon conclusion, selected the final bid submitted by EQT Corporation, through its wholly-owned subsidiary EQT Production Company ("EQT"), with a final purchase price of $527 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments and approval by the Bankruptcy Court, with an upward adjustment to the purchase price of up to $16 million in an amount equal to certain downward adjustments, as the prevailing bid. 
On February 9, 2017, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with EQT (the "EQT PSA"), reflecting the terms of the prevailing bid. Under the EQT PSA, the sale of the Appalachia Properties has an effective date of June 1, 2016. The EQT PSA contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. At the close of the sale of the Appalachia Properties, the Tug Hill PSA will terminate, and the Company will use a portion of the cash consideration received to pay Tug Hill a break-up fee of $10.8 million. On February 10, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered a sale order approving the sale of the Appalachia Properties to EQT. We expect to close the sale of the Appalachia Properties by February 28, 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.
For additional information on the bankruptcy proceedings, the A&R RSA, the Tug Hill PSA and the EQT PSA, see Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Operational Overview
Gulf of Mexico Basin
Our GOM Basin properties accounted for approximately 66% of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2016 on a volume equivalent basis. We have properties in the deep water of the GOM, as well as limited exposure to GOM conventional shelf and deep gas properties. In 2014, we sold a majority of our GOM conventional shelf properties. 
Gulf of Mexico — Deep Water.  We believe that the deep water of the GOM is an attractive area to acquire, explore, develop and operate with high-potential investment opportunities. We have made significant investments in seismic data and leasehold interests and have assembled a technical team with prior geological, geophysical, engineering and operational experience in the deep water arena to evaluate potential exploration, development and acquisition opportunities. Since 2006, we have made two 
3

significant acquisitions that included two deep water platforms, producing reserves and numerous leases. We have a portfolio of deep water projects ranging from lower risk development projects incorporating existing facilities to higher risk exploration prospects that would require a new production facility. We have utilized subsea tie-backs in the deep water on new drill wells, which require less capital and time than new deep water facilities. We have higher risk exploration prospects that could expose the company to significant reserves if successful. Projects in the deep water typically require substantially more time, planning, manpower and capital than an onshore project. Our deep water properties accounted for approximately 56% of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2016 on a volume equivalent basis.
Gulf Coast — Conventional Shelf and Deep Gas.  We have historically focused on the GOM conventional shelf, but after the sale of a majority of our GOM conventional shelf properties in 2014, we have significantly reduced our exposure in this area to primarily two remaining fields, which provide production and cash flow. There are limited exploitation and exploration projects for us on our GOM conventional shelf properties. The Gulf Coast deep gas play (prospects below 15,000 feet) provides us with higher potential exploration opportunities with existing infrastructure nearby, which shortens the lead time to production. Our conventional shelf and deep gas properties accounted for approximately 10% of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2016 on a volume equivalent basis.
Appalachia
In response to low commodity prices and high midstream costs in the area, we shut in our Mary field from September 2015 until late June 2016 and suspended completion operations on 25 drilled wells in Appalachia until commodity prices and margin improvements could be realized. In late June 2016, we entered into an interim Appalachian midstream contract that provided near-term relief by permitting us to resume profitable production and positive cash flow at the Mary field. 
In connection with our restructuring efforts, we determined that a sale of the Appalachia Properties would be a beneficial way to maximize value for all stakeholders. On February 9, 2017, we entered into the EQT PSA, and expect to close on the sale of the Appalachia Properties by February 28, 2017, subject to customary closing conditions. At December 31, 2016, the Appalachia Properties accounted for approximately 34% of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves on a volume equivalent basis. Upon closing, we will no longer have operations or assets in Appalachia. See Reorganization and Chapter 11 Proceedings – Purchase and Sale Agreement above.
Business Development
In prior years, the business development effort was focused on providing Stone with exposure to new or unproven plays that could add significant value to the Company if successful. Given the uncertainty regarding future commodity prices, we have only minimal capital allocated for onshore exploration projects or new venture opportunities.
Oil and Gas Marketing
Our oil and natural gas production is sold at current market prices under short-term contracts. Phillips 66 Company and Shell Trading (US) Company accounted for approximately 68% and 10%, respectively, of our oil and natural gas revenue generated during the year ended December 31, 2016. We do not believe that the loss of any of our major purchasers would result in a material adverse effect on our ability to market future oil and natural gas production. From time to time, we may enter into transactions that hedge the price of oil and natural gas. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Commodity Price Risk.
Competition and Markets
Competition in the GOM Basin and other onshore plays is intense, particularly with respect to the acquisition of producing properties and undeveloped acreage. We compete with major oil and gas companies and other independent producers of varying sizes, all of which are engaged in the acquisition of properties and the exploration and development of such properties. Many of our competitors have financial resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours, which may adversely affect our ability to compete. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – Competition within our industry may adversely affect our operations.
The availability of a ready market for and the price of any hydrocarbons produced will depend on many factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the amount of domestic production and imports of foreign oil and exports of liquefied natural gas, the marketing of competitive fuels, the proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines, the availability of transportation and other market facilities, the demand for hydrocarbons, the effect of federal and state regulation of allowable rates of production, taxation and the conduct of drilling operations and federal regulation of oil and natural gas. All of these factors, together with 
4

economic factors in the marketing arena, generally may affect the supply of and/or demand for oil and natural gas and thus the prices available for sales of oil and natural gas.
Regulation
Our oil and gas operations are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations.
Various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are regulated by certain agencies of the federal government for our operations on federal leases. The jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions requiring permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, provisions relating to the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells that may be drilled in an area and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some agencies can order the pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while others rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In addition, certain conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells.
Outer Continental Shelf Regulation. Our operations on federal oil and gas leases in the GOM are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement ("BSEE") and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ("BOEM"). These leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed BSEE and BOEM regulations and orders issued pursuant to various federal laws, including the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. These laws and regulations are subject to change, and many new requirements were imposed by the BSEE and BOEM subsequent to the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident. For offshore operations, lessees must obtain BOEM approval for exploration, development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations. In addition to permits required from other agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"), lessees must obtain a permit from the BSEE prior to the commencement of drilling and comply with regulations governing, among other things, engineering and construction specifications for production facilities, safety procedures, plugging and abandonment of wells on the Outer Continental Shelf ("OCS"), calculation of royalty payments and the valuation of production for this purpose, and removal of facilities. These rules are frequently subject to change. For example, in April 2016, BSEE issued its final well control regulations, effective July 2016, though some requirements of the rule have delayed compliance deadlines. The final rule addresses the full range of systems and equipment associated with well control operations, focusing on requirements for blowout preventers ("BOPs"), well design, well control casing, cementing, real-time monitoring and subsea containment. Key features of the well control regulations include requirements for BOPs, double shear rams, third-party reviews of equipment, real-time monitoring data, safe drilling margins, centralizers, inspections and other reforms related to well design and control, casing, cementing and subsea containment. Separately, BOEM proposed new rules in April 2016 that would update existing air emissions requirements relating to offshore oil and natural gas activity on federal OCS waters including in the Central Gulf of Mexico. BOEM regulates these air emissions in connection with its review of exploration and development plans, and right-of-use and right-of-way applications. The proposed rule would bolster existing air emission reporting requirements by, among other things, requiring the reporting and tracking of the emissions of all pollutants defined by the EPA to affect human health and public welfare. Compliance with new and future regulations could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business. In addition, under certain circumstances, the BSEE may require our operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated. Any such suspension or termination could adversely affect our financial condition and operations.
Additionally, on July 14, 2016, BOEM issued a new Notice to Lessees ("NTL"), with an effective date of September 12, 2016, that augments requirements for the posting of additional financial assurance by offshore lessees. The NTL discontinues the policy of Supplemental Bonding Waivers and allows for the ability to self-insure up to 10% of a company’s tangible net worth, where a company can demonstrate a certain level of financial strength. The NTL provides new procedures for how BOEM determines a lessee’s decommissioning obligations and, consistent with those procedures, BOEM has tentatively proposed an implementation timeline that offshore lessees will follow in providing additional financial assurance, including BOEM’s issuance of (i) “Self-Insurance” letters beginning September 12, 2016 (regarding a lessee’s ability to self-insure a portion of the additional financial assurance), (ii) “Proposal” letters beginning October 12, 2016 (outlining what amount of additional security a lessee will be required to provide), and (iii) “Order” letters beginning November 14, 2016 (triggering a lessee’s obligations (A) within 10 days of such letter to notify BOEM that it intends to pursue a “tailored plan” for posting additional security over a phased-in period of time, (B) within 60 days of such letter, provide additional security for “sole liability” properties (leases or grants for which there is no other current or prior owner who is liable for decommissioning obligations), and (C) within 120 days of such letter, provide additional security for any other properties and/or submit a tailored financial plan). 
5

We received a Self-Insurance letter from BOEM dated September 30, 2016 stating that we are not eligible to self-insure any of our additional security obligations. We received a Proposal letter from BOEM dated October 20, 2016 indicating that additional security may be required, and we are continuing to work with BOEM to adjust our previously submitted tailored plan for variances between our decommissioning estimates and that of BSEE's. In the first quarter of 2017, BOEM announced that it will extend the implementation timeline for the new NTL by an additional six months. The revised proposed plan we submitted to BOEM may require approximately $7 million to $10 million of incremental financial assurance or bonding for sole liability properties and potentially an additional $30 million to $60 million of incremental financial assurance or bonding for non-sole liability properties by the end of 2017 or in 2018, dependent on adjustments following ongoing discussions with BSEE and any modifications to the NTL. Under the revised proposed plan, additional financial assurance would be required for subsequent years. There is no assurance this tailored plan will be approved by BOEM, and BOEM may require further revisions to our plan. Additionally, it is uncertain at this time what impact the new Trump administration may have on the current financial regulatory framework. Compliance with the NTL, or any other new rules, regulations or legal initiatives by BOEM or other governmental authorities that impose more stringent requirements adversely affecting our offshore activities could delay or disrupt our operations, result in increased supplemental bonding and costs, limit our activities in certain areas, cause us to incur penalties or fines or to shut-in production at one or more of our facilities, or result in the suspension or cancellation of leases.
If fully implemented, the new NTL is likely to result in the loss of supplemental bonding waivers for a large number of operators on the OCS, which will in turn force these operators to seek additional surety bonds and could, consequently, challenge the surety bond market’s capacity for providing such additional financial assurance. Operators who have already leveraged their assets as a result of the declining oil market could face difficulty obtaining surety bonds because of concerns the surety companies may have about the priority of their lien on the operator's collateral. All of these factors may make it more difficult for us to obtain the financial assurances required by BOEM to conduct operations on the OCS. These and other changes to BOEM bonding and financial assurance requirements could result in increased costs on our operations and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. See Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Natural Gas.  In 2005, the United States Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ("EPAct 2005"). Among other matters, EPAct 2005 amends the Natural Gas Act (the "NGA") to make it unlawful for “any entity”, including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers such as Stone Energy, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the "FERC"), in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. In 2006, the FERC issued rules implementing this provision. The rules make it unlawful in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud, to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. EPAct 2005 also gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA up to $1 million per day per violation. The anti-manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering but does apply to activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted "in connection with" gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. It therefore reflects a significant expansion of the FERC’s enforcement authority. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC") has similar authority with respect to energy futures commodity markets. Stone Energy does not anticipate it will be affected any differently by these requirements than other producers of natural gas.
Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive regulation. The FERC has undertaken various initiatives to increase competition within the natural gas industry, including requiring interstate pipelines to provide firm and interruptible transportation service on an open access basis that is equal for all natural gas supplies. In addition, the natural gas pipeline industry is also subject to state regulations, which may change from time to time in ways that affect the availability, terms and cost of transportation. However, we do not believe that any such changes would affect our business in a way that would be materially different from the way such changes would affect our competitors.
Oil.  Effective November 4, 2009, pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") issued a rule prohibiting market manipulation in the petroleum industry. The FTC rule prohibits any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale, from knowingly engaging in any act, practice or course of business, including the making of any untrue statement of material fact, that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person or intentionally failing to state a material fact that under the circumstances renders a statement made by such person misleading, provided that such omission distorts or is likely to distort market conditions for any such product. A violation of this rule may result in civil penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation, in addition to any applicable penalty under the FTC Act.
6

Our sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids ("NGL"s) are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act. The price we receive from the sale of oil and NGLs is affected by the cost of transporting those products to market. Interstate transportation rates for oil, NGLs and other products are regulated by the FERC. The FERC has established an indexing system for such transportation, which allows such pipelines to take an annual inflation-based rate increase.
In other instances, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes. As it relates to intrastate crude oil, condensate and NGL pipelines, state regulation is generally less rigorous than the federal regulation of interstate pipelines. State agencies have generally not investigated or challenged existing or proposed rates in the absence of shipper complaints or protests, which are infrequent and are usually resolved informally.
We do not believe that the regulatory decisions or activities relating to interstate or intrastate crude oil, condensate and NGL pipelines will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other crude oil, condensate and NGL producers or marketers.
Miscellaneous.  Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by the United States Congress, state regulatory bodies, the BOEM, the BSEE, the FERC and other federal regulatory bodies and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has been heavily regulated. We can give no assurance that the regulatory approach currently pursued by the BOEM, the BSEE, the FERC or any other state or federal agency will continue indefinitely. 
Environmental Regulation
As a lessee and operator of offshore oil and gas properties in the United States, we are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, worker health and safety, and natural resources, as well as controlling the manner in which various substances, including wastes generated in connection with oil and gas industry operations, are released into the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to obtain permits authorizing air emissions and wastewater discharge from operations and can affect the location or size of wells and facilities, limit or prohibit the extent to which exploration and development may be allowed, and require proper closure of wells and restoration of properties that are being abandoned. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, imposition of remedial obligations, incurrence of capital costs to comply with governmental standards, and even injunctions that limit or prohibit exploration and production operations or the disposal of substances generated in connection with oil and gas industry operation. The following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject.
Waste handling.  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the "RCRA") and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Pursuant to regulatory guidance issued by the federal EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Also, in the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes if such wastes have hazardous characteristics.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the "CERCLA"), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for 
7

neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
We currently operate or lease, and have in the past operated or leased, a number of properties that for many years have been used in operations related to the exploration and production of oil and gas. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties operated or leased by us or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose storage, treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or wastes was not under our control. These properties and the hydrocarbons and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to laws and regulations imposing strict, joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, that could require us to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or environmental contamination, or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure to prevent future contamination.
Oil Pollution Act.  The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the "OPA") and regulations adopted pursuant thereto impose a variety of requirements related to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States, including the OCS. The OPA subjects owners of oil handling facilities to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a spill, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters and natural resource damages. Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by the OPA, they are limited. The OPA also requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill. The OPA currently requires a minimum financial responsibility demonstration of $35 million for companies operating on the OCS, although the Secretary of the Interior may increase this amount up to $150 million in certain situations. In addition, the BOEM has finalized rules that raise OPA’s damages liability cap from $75 million to $133.65 million. We cannot predict at this time whether the OPA will be amended further or whether the level of financial responsibility required for companies operating on the OCS will be increased. In any event, if an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge were to occur, we could be liable for costs and damages, which could be material to our results of operations and financial position.
Climate Change.  The EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other "greenhouse gases" present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA began adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act ("CAA"). The EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the CAA, one of which requires a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of greenhouse gases from certain large stationary sources through preconstruction and operating permit requirements.
The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, on an annual basis. Recent regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases has focused on fugitive methane emissions. For example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules that establish new air emission controls for emissions of methane from certain equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The EPA’s rule package includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions.
In addition, while the United States Congress has not taken any legislative action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, many states have established greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal.
The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or to comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Substantial limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. Our offshore operations are particularly at risk from severe climatic events. If any such climate changes were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

At this time, we have not yet developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social, or physical impacts of climate change on our operations.
Water discharges.  The federal Water Pollution Control Act (the "Clean Water Act") and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the monitoring and discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, or an analogous state agency. In addition, spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
Air emissions.  The CAA and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources, as well as the emission of other pollutants that the agency has determined pose a threat to the public health and welfare.
For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard ("NAAQS") for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements for our operations that have the potential to affect state air quality, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.
Endangered Species. Executive Order 13158, issued in May 2000, directs federal agencies to safeguard existing Marine Protected Areas ("MPAs") in the United States and establish new MPAs. The order requires federal agencies to avoid harm to MPAs to the extent permitted by law and to the maximum extent practicable. This order has the potential to adversely affect our operations by restricting areas in which we may carry out future development and exploration projects and/or causing us to incur increased operating expenses. Federal Lease Stipulations include regulations regarding the taking of protected marine species (sea turtles, marine mammals, Gulf sturgeon and other listed marine species). Historically, our compliance costs for the protection of marine species have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future. Certain flora and fauna that have been officially classified as "threatened" or "endangered" are protected by the Endangered Species Act ("ESA"). This law prohibits any activities that could “take” a protected plant or animal or reduce or degrade its habitat area. We conduct operations on leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist. 
Other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and which may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and may limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within designated protected areas, wilderness or wetlands. These and other protected areas may require certain mitigation measures to avoid harm to wildlife, and such laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. The permits required for our various operations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. 
We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures in our effort to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We do not believe that compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse impact on us. However, we also believe that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue toward stricter standards and, thus, we cannot give any assurance that we will not be adversely affected in the future.
We have established internal guidelines to be followed in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the United States. We employ a safety, environmental and regulatory department whose responsibilities include providing assurance that our operations are carried out in accordance with applicable environmental guidelines and safety precautions and track regulatory developments applicable to our operations, such as the ones described in the paragraphs above. Although we maintain pollution insurance to cover a portion of the costs of cleanup operations, public liability and physical damage, there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future. To 
9

date, we believe that compliance with existing requirements of such governmental bodies has not had a material effect on our operations.
Employees
On February 23, 2017, we had 241 full-time employees. We believe that our relationships with our employees are satisfactory. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various daily operational duties.
