Company Overview 
 Hortonworks, Inc.® delivers 100 percent open-source global data management solutions so that customers can deploy modern data architectures and realize the full value of their data. Our enterprise-ready solutions enable organizations to govern, secure and manage data of any kind, wherever it is located, and turn it into actionable intelligence that will help them transform their businesses. 
 Our platforms allow enterprises to manage their data on a global scale, whether it is data-in-motion or data-at-rest. We have the expertise, experience and proven solutions to power modern data applications, including streaming analytics, data science, artificial intelligence and more. 
 We are committed to driving innovation and market adoption of open source technologies within open source communities. We do this by sharing all of our open source product development in order to continue advancement of open source software. We employ a large number of committers to various Apache projects, including Apache Hadoop®, Apache NiFi, Apache Kafka and Apache Spark. A committer is an individual who is permitted by the Apache Software Foundation to modify the source code of a particular open source project and then commit those changes to the central repository. We believe that keeping our business model free from architecture design conflicts that could limit the success of our customers in leveraging the benefits of open source technology at scale is a significant competitive advantage. We have been recognized as a leader in Apache Hadoop by Forrester Research, Inc. based on the strength of our offerings and our differentiated strategy. 
 We were founded in 2011. During 2012 we launched Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP), during 2015 we launched Hortonworks DataFlow (HDF) and during 2017 we launched Hortonworks DataPlane Service (Hortonworks DPS). We sell support subscriptions and professional services offerings for these platforms. As of December 31, 2017, we had over 1,300 support subscription customers (which we generally define as an entity with an active support subscription) across a broad array of company sizes and industries. We have strategic relationships with Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon), Cisco Systems, Inc. (Cisco), Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (Hewlett Packard Enterprise), International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), NEC Corporation (NEC), Pivotal Software, Inc. (Pivotal), SAP AG (SAP), Teradata Corporation (Teradata) and Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo!), the operating assets of which were acquired by Verizon Communications, Inc. in 2017. These relationships are focused on integrated development, marketing and support strategies to maximize the success of our solutions. Consistent with our open source approach, we generally make our Connected Data Platforms (HDP and HDF) available free of charge and derive revenue primarily from customer fees for our support subscription offerings and professional services. 
 Our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $261.8 million, $184.5 million and $121.9 million, respectively. We incurred net losses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 of $204.5 million, $251.7 million and $179.1 million, respectively. We have reduced our cash used in operating activities to $29.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from $82.4 million and $99.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our total assets for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $250.7 million, $235.8 million, and $212.0 million, respectively. 
 Hortonworks, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in April 2011.

 Industry Background 
 For businesses today, the ability to maximize the value of data is critical. In fact, the insights data holds can be a companys most powerful competitive advantage. Major technology innovations such as mobile software-as-a-service and cloud computing, as well as the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), in which sensors and devices transmit increasing amounts of data automatically, have created an always-on, connected society. The increase in volume, velocity and variety from this new data in combination with traditional enterprise applications and data systems is creating significant challenges for enterprises in managing their data and is changing the way enterprises design their data infrastructure. 
 Enterprises are not only inundated with increasing amounts of data, but also struggle with managing more types of data that are less easily managed by traditional data center architectures. Historically, enterprises focused primarily on managing data from dedicated and disparate data center systems, including enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management systems. To store and process these types of data, enterprises used relational database management systems optimized for analyzing structured data stored within isolated systems. 
 Today, the variety of IoT data, including new types such as sensor and machine data, server log data, clickstream data, geo-location data, social and sentiment data and data generated by documents and other file types, is fueling the exponential growth in data volumes that has the potential to be captured and managed by the enterprise to drive business value. Collecting, storing, processing and analyzing these fast-growing, new, context-rich data sources requires new tools. 
 As a result of the limitations within traditional data center architectures, enterprise customers require new technologies to cost-effectively collect, store, process and analyze vast amounts of data in order to find patterns and actionable insights that enable them to capitalize on opportunities, avoid operational issues and enable more informed decisions. Enterprises must modernize their data center architectures to easily leverage these new data sources with existing data sources to deliver modern data applications. 
 Hadoop was originally developed in the early 2000s as a batch system to manage data at scale, but required siloed computing clusters for each application, thus limiting accessibility, interoperability and overall value. Incremental attempts to improve traditional Hadoop focused on bolting on data warehousing and analytics functionality as well as basic security and operations management, available through a mix of open source or commercially available software. This innovation demonstrated the early promise of Hadoop in enabling enterprises to address their big data requirements, but still lacked the breadth of functionality and resiliency that would enable broader deployment in production use cases. 
 To improve on this early functionality, Hortonworks engineers created the initial architecture for Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN) and developed the technology within the Apache Hadoop community, leading to the release of YARN in October 2013. This technology advancement transformed Hadoop into a platform that allows for multiple ways of interacting with data, including interactive structured query language (SQL) processing, in-memory analytic processing, real-time stream processing and online data processing, along with its traditional batch data processing. YARN represented a significant innovation in that it eliminated the need for siloed data sets and reduces total cost of ownership by enabling a single cluster to store a shared data set on which mixed workloads spanning batch, interactive and real-time use cases can simultaneously process with predictable service levels. YARN is designed to serve as a common data operating system that enables the Hadoop ecosystem to natively integrate applications and leverage existing technologies while extending consistent security, governance and operations across the platform. With YARN as a cornerstone embedded within Hadoop, it facilitated the mainstream adoption of Hadoop by enterprises of all types and sizes for production use cases at scale.

 Our Opportunity 
 In todays world, enterprises that successfully adopt a global data strategy will succeed, whereas enterprises that fail or are slow to implement a modern data architecture will struggle to sustain competitive advantages. We believe that the new class of enterprise-scale data management platforms and services must meet certain requirements to create and accelerate widespread market adoption and enable the modern data architecture. We believe this set of requirements include: 

 | capability to centrally manage new and existing data types;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 | ability to run multiple analytical applications (batch, interactive, predictive) simultaneously on a common data architecture;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | high availability, manageability, security and data governance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | interoperability with new and existing data center and cloud infrastructures;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ability to analyze real-time streams of data for immediate actionable insights; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ability to securely capture and mediate multi-directional data flows within and outside the data center.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that only by adopting a solution that meets these requirements, will enterprises be able to address their growing data management requirements. We believe our platforms address these needs and are fundamental to driving this architectural shift and to turn what was traditionally viewed as a cost center into a revenue generator by enabling new business applications that harness the power of big data.

 We have established a strategic relationship with Pivotal that includes joint engineering to extend the enterprise capabilities of Apache Hadoop and YARN with Pivotal technologies like HAWQ and GemFire, certification of Pivotals Big Data Suite on HDP and a support agreement covering Pivotal HD. 
 We have established a strategic relationship with Amazon to offer HDCloud for AWS as a platform for analyzing and processing data. HDCloud for AWS users can choose from preset prescriptive cluster configurations tuned to work with Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS to facilitate analyzing data in minutes. 
 We have established a strategic industry association, the Open Data Platform initiative (ODPi), with other leading technology companies in the big data sector. This industry association is aimed at speeding Hadoop adoption through ecosystem interoperability rooted in open source. As ecosystem and solution providers create value from Hadoop through the ODPis ongoing efforts, enterprise customers will see the benefits of increased choice with more big data applications and solutions running atop a common core of Hadoop. 
 Further, leading enterprise software and infrastructure vendors as well as global systems integrators with solutions that run on or with the HDP and HDF offerings include Accenture plc, Amazon, Capgemini, Cisco, Dell EMC, Ernst & Young Global Limited, Google Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, LucidWorks, Inc., Microsoft, NetApp, Inc., Pivotal, SAP, SAS Institute Inc., Teradata, Tableau Software, Inc., VMware, Inc. and Wipro Limited. 
 Competition 
 Within the Enterprise Hadoop market, we compete against a variety of large software and infrastructure vendors, smaller specialized companies and custom development efforts. Our principal competitors in this market include pure play Hadoop distribution vendors such as Cloudera Inc. (Cloudera) and MapR Technologies, Inc. (MapR), enterprise software and infrastructure vendors that offer Hadoop distributions such as Oracle Corporation (Oracle), as well as cloud computing vendors that offer big data processing services such as Amazon. 
 Within the broader big data market, an Enterprise Hadoop solution may compete for workloads against traditional data warehouse solutions from large vendors such as Teradata, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, SAP and Dell EMC, and non-relational NoSQL databases from pure play vendors such as MongoDB, Inc. (MongoDB) and DataStax, Inc. (DataStax). Because Enterprise Hadoop is commonly integrated with traditional data warehouses, such as our partnerships with Teradata and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and NoSQL databases, such as our partnership with DataStax, this category of vendors and solutions comprises a set of key partners who may compete with us in certain instances while partnering with us in others. 
 We believe the principal competitive factors in the Enterprise Hadoop and big data markets for our solutions are as follows: 
 

 | name and reputation of the vendor or competitive offering;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | ability to adapt development, sales, marketing and support to the open source software model;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product price, performance, scalability, reliability, functionality and ease of use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | value of support subscription offerings and quality of support and professional services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | strategic alliances with major enterprise software and infrastructure providers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | availability of third-party solutions that are integrated with and compatible with the technology;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | number of Global 2000 reference accounts;
--+------------------------------------------


 | ability to provide a credible and actionable roadmap for the technology;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ability to quickly diagnose software issues and provide patches and other solutions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
9 
 
Index to Financial Statements
 
 | strength of the vendors relationships and reputation in the open source community; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | employment of open source technology core committers and innovators.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we generally compete favorably on the basis of the foregoing factors. 
 The traditional barriers to entry that are found in the proprietary software model do not characterize the open source software model. For example, the financial and legal barriers to creating a new Hadoop distribution are relatively low because the software components typically included in Hadoop distributions are publicly available under open source licenses that permit copying, modification and redistribution. However, while anyone can use, copy, modify and redistribute HDP, HDF or other of our offerings, the technical skills, knowledge and capability of our team of committers provides a point of differentiation in the marketplace. Furthermore, others are not permitted to refer to the product using the trademarked Hortonworks name or other proprietary marks unless they have a formal business relationship with us that allows such references. 
 Some of our actual and potential competitors have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, stronger brand and business user recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios and broader global distribution and presence. In addition, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. Larger and more established companies may focus on operational intelligence and could directly compete with us. Smaller companies could also launch new products and services that we do not offer and that could gain market acceptance quickly. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our offerings, including HDP, HDF and Hortonworks DPS, are built on software components licensed to the general public under open source licenses. We obtain many components from software developed and released by contributors to independent open source software development projects primarily at the Apache Software Foundation. Open source licenses typically grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify and redistribute these components. As a result, open source development and licensing practices can limit the value of our software copyright assets. 
 Hortonworks SmartSense is an optional proactive support service available with our support subscriptions offerings that contains proprietary intellectual property. SmartSense monitors Hortonworks platforms in order to proactively find performance and configuration issues and provide recommendations to help avoid potential future issues. We actively pursue patent protection for technology associated with this proactive support service. 
 We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, patent and trademark laws, a variety of contractual arrangements, such as license agreements, assignment agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality procedures and technical measures to gain rights to and protect the intellectual property used in our business. 
 We also rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties, including under certain open source licenses. Though such third-party technologies may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technologies would be available to us. 
 Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information, and all of our key employees and contractors have done so. We also control and monitor access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. 
 For a discussion of the risk factors relating to intellectual property that we believe could impact our actual and expected results, see Item 1ARisk Factors.
