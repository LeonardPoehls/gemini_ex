 BUSINESS 
 Overview 
 As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “we,” “us”, “our”, “the Company” and “BSQUARE” refer to BSQUARE Corporation. 
 Since our inception, our business has largely been focused on providing software solutions (historically including reselling software from Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”)) and related engineering services to businesses that develop, market and sell dedicated purpose standalone intelligent systems. Examples of dedicated purpose standalone intelligent systems include smart, connected computing devices such as smart phones, set-top boxes, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, tablets and handheld data collection devices, as well as smart vending machines, ATM machines, digital signs and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices. We focus on systems that utilize various Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux, and QNX, and that are usually connected to a network or data cloud via a wired or wireless connection. Our customers include world-class original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), original design manufacturers (“ODMs”), corporate enterprises (“Enterprises”), silicon vendors (“SVs”) and peripheral vendors. A significant portion of our business historically has also been focused on reselling software from Microsoft, from which a majority of our revenue currently continues to be derived.
 Beginning in early 2014, we initiated development efforts focused on new proprietary software products addressing the Internet of Things (“IoT”) market, which is the interconnection of uniquely identifiable embedded computing devices within the existing internet infrastructure. While IoT is a relatively new market, we believe the work we have engaged in since our inception—namely adding intelligence and connectivity to discrete standalone devices and systems—embodies much of what is central to the core functionality of IoT. These software development efforts have driven a new business initiative for BSQUARE, which we refer to as DataV™. Our DataV solution includes software products, applications and services that are designed to render raw IoT device data into meaningful and actionable data for our customers. 
 We launched DataV late in the first quarter of 2016 and announced our first three major customer bookings later that year. These bookings comprised software licensing, software maintenance and related systems integration services and are, we believe, indicative of the potential customer demand for DataV. 
 1
 

We believe that DataV presents high growth opportunities in a large, expanding addressable market, at substantially higher gross margins as compared to our traditional business. Over time, we intend for DataV to become our primary focus, representing a transition away from dependence on resale software and engineering services toward increased reliance on our own proprietary software and related systems integration services. As a result, we focused virtually all of our research and development and marketing efforts, as well as a majority of our sales efforts, on DataV during 2016. We intend to continue to run our legacy software resale and engineering services business for the foreseeable future.
 We were incorporated in the State of Washington in July 1994. Our principal office is located at 110 110th Avenue NE, Suite 300, Bellevue, Washington 98004, and our telephone number is (425) 519-5900. 
 Industry Background 
 The IoT market is still emerging, but we believe it will present a large market opportunity for us. This market includes consumer, business, government and industrial segments, and encompasses software, hardware, connectivity and cloud providers as well as systems integrators. While larger research firms do not yet widely track the IoT market, available research anticipates that over time, the deployment of hundreds of billions of connected devices may generate trillions of dollars of economic value.
 The IoT marketplace is currently being influenced by the following factors: 
  
• | Development of machine learning and data analytics software that advances the understanding of complex systems but lacks the capability to effectively process the proliferation of resulting data. This provides an opportunity for solutions such as DataV to develop models of complex mechanical equipment that can be used for predictive reasoning;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Nearly ubiquitous wireless connectivity, including near-field communications (“NFC”), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and cellular, allowing connectivity and data exchange with large populations of small, remote, and frequently mobile devices;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Competitive pressures that are forcing a wide array of businesses to invest in automation as a way to improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance the value of their own offerings; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The availability of inexpensive cloud compute and storage capabilities able to scale to the extent likely to be demanded by IoT.

DataV Software
 DataV is a comprehensive software solution developed by BSQUARE intended to address a variety of business use cases specific to industrial IoT applications. DataV addresses the following business use cases:
  
• | Predictive Failure: By employing machine learning and advanced data analytics, DataV is able to predict, with varying levels of accuracy, future operational conditions for equipment or devices that are part of the overall IoT system. For many industrial concerns, the operational condition of greatest interest is a failure state. By being able to predict failures before they occur, DataV customers are able to take steps to remediate the condition more quickly, less expensively and with less operational disruption.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adaptive Diagnostics: For equipment that has already failed, DataV can dynamically proscribe diagnostic and repair steps that have the highest probability of quickly and less expensively resolving the problem. DataV uses historical repair data coupled with machine learning and data analytics to achieve this.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2
 

 
• | IoT Device Management: The spread of data-generating devices in IoT systems introduces a new set of operational problems for industrial concerns. DataV is able to facilitate IoT device management, including software and configuration updates, over large-scale populations of connected devices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Condition-Based Maintenance: DataV allows organizations to move beyond maintenance cycles based solely on time or usage, which inevitably result in over- or under-servicing of equipment. DataV develops maintenance schedules based on actual equipment condition using not only device data but environmental data as well. This results in lower overall service costs and improved asset longevity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Asset Optimization: Industrial concerns with large fleets of similar equipment want to ensure the performance of their equipment is maximized. DataV, again by employing machine learning, data analytics, and historical data, can help these customers identify underperforming assets and proscribe remediation steps.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Asset Utilization: DataV can assist our customers in tracking how their products are used in the field. This can help ensure that equipment use is as intended, an important requirement for heavy equipment rental firms. It can also provide product designers with feedback that can help improve product performance and differentiation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The DataV solution is designed to be implemented in a wide variety of industrial sectors and vertical markets, including commercial transportation, oil and gas extraction, manufacturing, water and power, medical devices and others. These industrial sectors share common operational characteristics, such as the dependence on complex capital equipment where the cost of failure or sub-optimal performance is relatively high. In other cases, our customers seek new revenue-generating products or services to enhance operating profitability. We license our DataV software through various customer licensing models, including perpetual and subscription, and we are flexible in providing DataV on-premises, hosted or via a software as a service (“SaaS”) model.
 We officially launched DataV as a commercially available product in March 2016. Although we had previously engaged in several paid proof-of-concept tests with customers prior to that, we secured our first order in May 2016. This order, valued at $4.3 million over a three-year period, allowed PACCAR, Inc., a heavy-duty truck manufacturer, to employ adaptive diagnostics in order to more rapidly service and repair trucks. The order included a perpetual license to use DataV for that specific application on certain engines in North America, as well as annual maintenance and custom systems integration services.
 In November 2016, we secured our second DataV order. This order, placed by Itron, Inc., a large global manufacturer of electric, water, and gas meters for utilities as well as smart city solutions targeting IoT device management, is valued at $1.9 million for the first year with a $2.9 million four-year extension option. The deal includes a subscription license to use DataV in addition to maintenance and systems integration services.
 In December 2016, we secured an order from a global provider of candy and beverages. This contract is for a smart vending initiative that adds intelligence to existing fleets of vending machines, allowing them to better track real-time sales data and, in the future, better predict equipment failures within these machines.
 Third-Party Software Products 
 We have distribution agreements with multiple third-party software vendors. Our ability to resell these third-party software products, whether stand-alone or in conjunction with our own proprietary software and engineering service offerings, provides our customers with a significant solution source for their project needs. Our primary third-party software offerings include the following: 

• | For 18 years, we have been a Microsoft authorized Value-Added Provider (“VAP”) of Windows Embedded operating systems and toolkits for the complete line of Windows Embedded products, including major product families such as Windows Embedded Compact, Windows Embedded Standard and Windows Embedded Server. We are authorized to sell Windows Embedded operating systems in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Peru, Puerto Rico, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), the European Union (“E.U.”), the European Free Trade Association, Turkey and Africa. Of our total revenue, 72% in 2016 and 64% in 2015 resulted from the sale of Windows Embedded operating systems. Our current distribution agreements related to Windows Embedded expire on June 30, 2017 and are typically renewed annually or bi-annually;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have been a Microsoft authorized VAP of Windows Mobile operating systems since November 2009. Along with Windows Mobile operating systems, we also sell Microsoft’s Office Mobile product. We are currently authorized to sell Windows Mobile operating systems and related products in North America, South America, and Central America (excluding Cuba) (the “Americas”), Japan, Taiwan, and the region comprised of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”). Of our total revenue in 2016, 9% was generated through the sale of Windows Mobile operating systems, compared to 12% in 2015. Our current distribution agreements related to Windows Mobile expire on June 30, 2017 and are typically renewed annually or bi-annually;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Service revenue derived from our engagement with The Coca-Cola Company was $3.4 million, or 23%, of 2016 service revenue, and $4.5 million, or 22%, of service revenue in 2015. 
 Strategy 
 Our strategy is to invest in growing our DataV solution, while we continue to operate our third-party software and ongoing engineering services business as efficiently as possible and invest the cash generated by this business in our DataV solution. Toward that end, in 2016 we:

• | Focused all research and development efforts on development of our DataV solution and related business applications. During 2016, we made significant investment in software development, quality assurance, and data scientists;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focused all marketing efforts on launching our DataV solution and building our IoT business solutions brand. During 2016, we significantly expanded the size of our marketing team and the array of marketing programs in which we engage;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focused a substantial majority of our sales organization on DataV. During 2016, we significantly expanded the DataV sales group with new hires and internal transfers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintained our third-party software sales group essentially flat from prior years and will manage this group to maximize cash flow opportunities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rightsized our engineering services team in 2016 to increase profitability on ongoing service contracts, as well as to better position this team to expand our service offerings in support of DataV; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Launched a customer solutions group in 2016, chartered with building enterprise-scale customer support, cloud hosting, and DataV services capabilities. This group also includes our professional engineering services organization.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Collectively, we intend for these steps to help us execute on a higher-margin proprietary software business enabled by related systems integration services, while reducing our dependency on our legacy lower-margin software and lower value added services business.

 Sales and Marketing 
 We market our software solutions and engineering services utilizing a direct sales model. We have sales personnel throughout the United States and in Taiwan, the United Kingdom and Japan. Historically, we have not made significant use of resellers, channel partners, representative agents or other indirect channels. 
 Key elements of our sales and marketing strategy include direct marketing, content marketing, trade shows, event marketing, public relations, analyst relations, social media properties, customer and strategic alliance partner co-marketing programs and a comprehensive website.
 Research and Development 
 During 2016, substantially all of our research and development personnel were dedicated to the design, development and release of DataV, and we expect this to continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. Members of our research and development staff work closely with our sales and marketing departments, as well as with our customers and potential customers, to better understand the IoT market needs and requirements. We perform our research and development primarily utilizing engineering staff located in the United States. Research and development expense was $2.86 million and $1.64 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Customers 
 Targeted customers for DataV include large industrial concerns that either manufacture capital assets, such as a heavy-duty commercial truck manufacturer, or rely on the widespread deployment of capital assets in the operation of their businesses, such as a large for-hire fleet operator. DataV customers may also include manufacturers incorporating DataV within their own offerings in order to add capabilities otherwise unavailable, such as an electric meter manufacturer developing smart grid technology for power utilities.
 Customers purchasing third-party software and our other software solutions and engineering services include leading OEMs, ODMs, Enterprises, SVs and peripheral vendors. Representative customers include Hewlett Packard, Google, Coca-Cola, Elo Touch Solutions, Honeywell International, Inc., IGT, Microsoft, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Panasonic, Oracle, Omnicell, Elektrobit and several industrial handset companies.

Competition 
 The IoT market is still emerging. Our competitors in this space include, or we anticipate could include, the following:
  
• | Large, established enterprise software and solution providers such as IBM, SAS, Oracle and SAP;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cloud IoT providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and General Electric (“GE”) Predix. Although we are closely partnered with AWS and Microsoft, there are elements of their solutions with which we compete directly;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mid-sized companies engaged in business transitions similar to our own, including PTC ThingWorx; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Startups funded to enter the IoT market, including C3IoT and others.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Competition for our traditional third-party software and engineering solutions business includes:
  
• | Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system distributors such as Arrow Electronics, Inc., Avnet, Inc. and Synnex Corporation in Taiwan;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our current and potential customers’ internal research and development departments, which may seek to develop their own software solutions which compete with our proprietary software products and engineering services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engineering service firms, including off-shore development companies, such as Wiketeo, SymphonyTeleca division of Harmon Industries and Wipro;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ODMs, particularly those in Taiwan and China, which have added or are adding software development capabilities to their offerings; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Contract manufacturers, which have added or are adding software development capabilities to their offerings.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products, which can be integrated with our products. As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed. Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed. It is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share. 
 Microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has it agreed not to compete with us. Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us. The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected systems software and services is low. In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system software and services. These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to the Microsoft technology as we are. New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing. We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced. 
 International Operations 
 Our international operations outside of North America consist principally of engineering services operations in Taipei, Taiwan and Trowbridge, England. We have a sales and sales support office in Tokyo, Japan. Because our OEM Distribution Agreement with Microsoft for the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems (e.g. Windows Embedded Compact) has been, until relatively recently, restricted to North America, including Mexico, the majority of our revenue continues to be generated from North America. In 2016, revenue generated from customers located outside of North America was 5% of total revenue, compared to 8% in 2015. The decrease in revenue from outside of North America in 2016 was due to lower third-party software and professional engineering services revenue in both Asia and EMEA.
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for more information regarding our international operations.

 Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights 
 In general, we strive to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and through contractual arrangements. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, or competitive with, those developed by us. 
 Additionally, because a significant portion of our revenue relates to the sale of third-party software products, we also rely on our partners, particularly Microsoft, to appropriately protect their own intellectual property. 
 As of January 31, 2017, we had five pending United States (“US”) patent applications related to DataV, in addition to nine issued US patents related to other products and services. We also have a number of registered trademarks in various jurisdictions. We will continue to pursue appropriate protections for our intellectual property. 
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for more information regarding our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
