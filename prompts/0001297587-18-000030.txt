ABOUT US
Gramercy Property Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust ("REIT"), is a leading global investor and asset manager of commercial real estate. We specialize in acquiring and managing income producing commercial real estate leased to high quality tenants in major markets throughout the United States and Europe. 
Our commercial real estate holdings predominantly consist of industrial properties comprising 78.0% of our Annualized Base Rent (“ABR”) as of December 31, 2017. We also own a number of single and multi-tenant office properties and a portfolio of specialty retail assets, which include retail bank branches, fitness centers and rental car facilities. 
At December 31, 2017, our wholly-owned industrial portfolio was comprised of 75.8 million aggregate rentable square feet with a total ABR of $358.1 million and an average building age of approximately 14 years. The industrial portfolio's largest markets at year end (weighted by ABR) were Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles/Inland Empire, Indianapolis, Baltimore/Washington, South Florida, Memphis, Spartanburg, and Central Pennsylvania. Our wholly-owned office portfolio was comprised of 5.0 million aggregate rentable square feet with a total ABR of $83.7 million. Lastly, our wholly-owned specialty retail portfolio was comprised of 1.3 million aggregate rentable square feet of building space with a total ABR of $17.5 million that we lease to fitness centers, a rental car operator and various retail bank branches in infill locations, predominantly leased by Bank of America, N.A.
As of December 31, 2017, our wholly-owned portfolio had 96.5% occupancy and a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.2 years (based on ABR). As of December 31, 2017, our tenants were 33.3% investment grade rated or were the subsidiaries of parents with investment grade ratings (based on ABR). The top five tenants by ABR include FedEx Corp. and subsidiaries (5.6%), Life Time Fitness (3.1%), Bank of America, N.A. (2.5%), Amazon and subsidiaries (1.9%), and The Clorox International Company (1.9%). 
As of December 31, 2017, we also own unconsolidated equity investments comprised of industrial and office properties with an aggregate 2.3 million rentable square feet and an average base rent per square foot of $19.24 (based on ABR).
Corporate Structure
We were formed as a Maryland REIT in March 2004. In December 2015, we completed a merger (the “Merger”) of Gramercy Property Trust Inc. ("Legacy Gramercy") into Chambers Street Properties ("Chambers"), with Chambers as the surviving entity. Following the Merger, we changed our name to “Gramercy Property Trust” and our New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) trading symbol to “GPT.”
Our operating partnership, GPT Operating Partnership LP (the "Operating Partnership"), indirectly owns all of our consolidated real estate investments and our interests in unconsolidated investments. We are the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership is the 100.0% owner of all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017, third-party holders of limited partnership interests owned approximately 2.67% of the Operating Partnership.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code") and generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes to the extent we timely distribute our taxable income, if any, to our shareholders. We have in the past established, and may in the future establish, taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs") to effect various taxable transactions. Those TRSs would incur U.S. federal, state and local taxes on the taxable income from their activities.
Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to “Company,” “Gramercy,” “we,” “our,” and “us” mean Legacy Gramercy and its subsidiaries, including Legacy Gramercy's operating partnership and its subsidiaries, for periods prior to the Merger closing and Gramercy Property Trust and its subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, for periods following the Merger closing.
Investment Strategy
Our strategy is to focus on stabilized, income producing industrial properties and to pursue office properties on an opportunistic basis. We believe industrial properties offer compelling risk adjusted returns in the net leased marketplace. In our experience, industrial assets have more stable tenancy and a more direct and critical relationship to the tenant’s underlying operations. Industrial assets also have lower carrying costs when vacant, lower re-leasing costs to replace tenants and lower ongoing capital requirements during the period of ownership.
Focus on Real Estate Fundamentals
We believe that real estate underwriting is an important aspect of our investment process in the net lease market, and that traditional real estate fundamentals will be the primary driver of investment performance in the current environment, in contrast to past practices where long lease terms and tenant credit quality were the primary drivers.
4

Target Real Estate Markets with Attractive Fundamentals - We will continue to concentrate our investment activity in target markets with growing populations, high quality infrastructure, diversified local economies with multiple economic drivers, strong demographics, pro-business local governments and high quality local labor pools. We believe that these markets offer a higher probability of producing long-term rent growth and/or capital appreciation.
Buy and Own Properties with Contract Rents that are Competitive with Market Rents - We target properties with contract rents that are competitive with rents for similar properties in the market as a way to reduce the volatility of cash flows that can occur upon the expiration of a lease or the loss of a tenant.
Properties with Long Lease Terms - We generally target properties that have between five and 20 years of lease term. We believe that longer lease terms provide more stable cash flows, are less susceptible to short term changes in market conditions and require less capital expenditures to maintain tenancy. We also consider properties with shorter lease terms individually or as part of portfolio transactions where we believe that compelling returns can be achieved. 
Properties Acquired at Above Market Yields Due to Some Market Inefficiency - We seek opportunities to acquire properties at attractive prices due to a mispricing of tenant credit or real estate risk, or a misunderstanding of the nature of the investment that may limit the competitive environment.
Target Mission Critical, Non-Traditional Net Leased Properties - We target specialized properties that we believe fall outside many traditional institutional investor parameters, but offer unique utility to a tenant or an industry and can therefore be acquired at attractive yields relative to the underlying risk. Examples of specialized properties include cross-dock truck terminals, cold storage facilities, parking facilities, air-freight facilities, steel distribution facilities, properties with high parking requirements and other mission critical facilities.
Target Transactions Where We Have a Competitive Advantage 
Individual Properties - We seek to acquire individual properties where the size of the transaction causes less competition from larger institutions who generally look for larger properties and portfolios.
Portfolios - We believe there are also opportunities to purchase portfolios of properties from existing owners who are either investor owners or corporations that occupy their properties. The market for large portfolios currently has many well-capitalized buyers actively bidding for these portfolios and we expect this market to remain competitive for the foreseeable future.
Sale Leasebacks - We believe our management team is among the most experienced and well known in the sale leaseback industry, such that we can source and effectively compete on sale leaseback transactions.
Developments - We engage in select development activities, which are primarily build-to-suit transactions, where we acquire newly constructed buildings that are pre-leased to a tenant. We will also opportunistically invest in limited speculative industrial development either directly or with developers through joint venture and mezzanine debt structures.
Actively Manage the Portfolio
Seek Opportunities to Extend Leases through Expansions or Capital Investments - We focus on net leased investment properties where, in our view, there is the potential to invest incremental capital or expand buildings to accommodate a tenant’s business, extend lease terms and increase the value of a property. We believe these opportunities can generate attractive returns due to the nature of the relationship between the landlord and tenant.
5

Acquire Assets at Competitive Rent Levels - We target industrial and office properties with rents that we believe are competitive with, or slightly below, market rents. We believe that the net leased marketplace does not properly differentiate and price these properties and that these investment opportunities can generate growth in income and residual value over time.
Identify Long-term Appreciation Opportunities - We believe there are opportunities to acquire properties with longer term leases that provide current cash flow for the term of the lease and that, if correctly identified, have the potential upon lease expiration for a higher and better use that may provide capital appreciation over the long-run.
Focus on Risk Management 
Underwrite and Structure Investments to Protect Downside and Preserve Cash Flows - We seek to invest in properties that have steady, predictable cash flow through: (a) long-term, well-structured leases, (b) high leasehold value for tenants, and (c) a high likelihood of renewal. We further seek to protect our investment by purchasing properties at prices at or below estimated replacement cost.
Utilize Portfolio Diversification - We seek to diversify our portfolio by property type, tenant credit, geography and tenant industry. As of December 31, 2017, our largest tenant was FedEx Corp. and subsidiaries, which accounted for 5.6% of our ABR as of that date. As we continue to grow, we expect to further diversify our portfolio.
Investment Process
We utilize relationships with various real estate owners, real estate advisors and intermediaries, developers, investment and commercial banks, private equity sponsors, and other potential deal sources to identify a broad pipeline of investment opportunities. Our review includes an evaluation of the creditworthiness of the tenant(s), the criticality of the property to the tenant(s), an evaluation of the market and submarket where the property is located, the location, age, functionality and marketability of the property, the lease structure and how contract rents relate to rents for similar buildings in the submarket, the replacement cost for a similar asset, the expected returns and pricing, and other factors that go into the overall evaluation of the investment opportunity. We also perform a due diligence review with respect to each potential acquisition, including evaluation of physical condition and structural soundness, zoning and site requirement compliance and environmental assessments. Our management team actively looks to source proprietary investment opportunities that are not being generally marketed for sale.
Investment Policy 
All real estate investments, dispositions and financings must be approved by a committee consisting of our most senior officers, including the affirmative approval of our Chief Executive Officer. Real estate investments and dispositions having a transaction value greater than $50.0 million must also be approved by the investment committee of our board of trustees. Our board of trustees must approve all such transactions having a value of $100.0 million or more. Additionally, the investment committee of the board must approve non-recourse financings greater than $50.0 million and our board of trustees must approve all recourse financings, regardless of amount, non-recourse financings of $100.0 million or more, and all related-party transactions, regardless of amount. For purposes of approval thresholds, unconsolidated equity investments are calculated using our allocated portion of the price of the asset or amount of the financing.
We generally intend to hold our properties for an extended period. However, circumstances might arise which could result in the early sale of some properties. We also may acquire a portfolio of properties with the intention of holding only a core group of properties and disposing of the remainder of the portfolio in single or multiple sales. The determination 
6

of whether a particular property should be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made with the view of achieving maximum capital appreciation.
We may use TRSs to acquire, hold, or dispose of properties, including assets that may not be deemed to be REIT-qualified assets. Taxes paid by such entity will reduce the cash available to us to fund our continuing operations and cash available for distributions to our shareholders.
Some of our investments have been made and may continue to be made through unconsolidated equity investments, which permit us to own interests in larger properties or portfolios without restricting the diversity of our portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, our unconsolidated equity investments consisted of the following: (1) 25.0% interest in the Strategic Office Partners unconsolidated equity investment, which invests in single-tenant office assets in high-growth metropolitan areas in the United States and owns a portfolio of 13 properties, (2) 51.0% interest in an e-commerce joint venture formed in November 2017, (3) 80.0% interest in one industrial property in the United Kingdom, (4) 25.0% interest in an office property located in Somerset, New Jersey, and (5) 50.0% interest in an office property located in Morristown, New Jersey. Additionally, in late 2017 we formed a new European investment fund, in which we have a 19.9% interest, and which will begin acquiring properties in 2018.
Capital Strategy
In addition to cash on hand and cash from operations, we anticipate using funds from various sources to finance our acquisitions and operations, including public and private debt and equity issuances, unsecured bank credit facilities and term loans, property-level mortgage debt, common units of limited partnership in the Operating Partnership ("OP Units") and other sources that may become available from time to time. We believe that moderate leverage is prudent and we consider all capital-related decisions with the intention to maintain our investment grade ratings of Baa3 from Moody’s Investors Services, BBB from Fitch Ratings, and BBB- from Standard and Poor’s Rating Service.
Significant 2017 Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired 79 properties aggregating approximately 19.6 million square feet for approximately $1.5 billion and also acquired seven land parcels for approximately $10.2 million, on which we have committed to construct industrial facilities for an estimated $95.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 34 properties as well as two offices that were part of another asset aggregating 3.2 million square feet for gross proceeds of $412.6 million. As a result of the transactions during the year, we have continued the repositioning strategy that we commenced in 2016 following the Merger, which is focused on reducing our office exposure and forming a real estate portfolio that primarily consists of institutional quality income oriented industrial properties throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio was 78.0% industrial, based on ABR.
In July 2017, our European investment fund in which we owned a 14.2% interest (the “Gramercy European Property Fund”), sold 100.0% of its assets and, concurrently, we sold our 5.1% interest in another European investment in real estate assets (the “Goodman Europe JV”). The transactions resulted in net distributions to us of approximately $102.8 million (€90.1 million), inclusive of a promoted interest distribution of approximately $8.8 million (€7.7 million). As of December 31, 2017, we had no remaining interest in the Gramercy European Property Fund or the Goodman Europe JV.
In October 2017, we formed a new European investment fund with several other equity investment partners, (the “Gramercy European Property Fund III”), which has total initial capital commitment of $315.3 million (€262.6 million) from all investors, of which our initial capital commitment is $62.7 million (€52.2 million), representing an interest of 
7

approximately 19.9%. We provide asset and property management and accounting services to the Gramercy European Property Fund III, for which we are entitled to management fees and a promoted interest. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we contributed $3.0 million (€2.5 million) to the Gramercy European Property Fund III, of which $2.3 million (€1.9 million) was accrued as of December 31, 2017. 
In November 2017, we formed a new joint venture with an investment partner, which will acquire, own and manage Class A distribution centers leased to leading e-commerce tenants on long-term leases across the country, (the "E-Commerce JV"). We provide asset and property management and accounting services to the E-Commerce JV, for which we earn management fees. We have a 51.0% interest in the E-Commerce JV and have committed capital to fund its initial acquisition of six properties, as well as the acquisition of additional properties in the future, subject to the partners' approval. Our pro rata funding commitment for the initial six properties is estimated at approximately $110.0 million, which will be funded using a combination of OP Units and cash.
Development
We have a development practice that focuses primarily on build-to-suit transactions where a tenant has signed a lease in advance of construction and a developer or builder bears the risk of completion on-time and on-budget, as well as performing property improvements specified in leases. We also invest opportunistically in speculative development projects where we bear the risk of leasing the property. We pursue these developments in markets where we have competitive advantages, such as an existing footprint of industrial properties.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed one industrial build-to-suit property located in Spartanburg, South Carolina for 432,100 square feet and a total investment of approximately $25.8 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had seven industrial developments in progress located in Charleston, South Carolina, Phoenix, Arizona, Charlotte, North Carolina, and Memphis, Tennessee for a total of approximately 1,383,262 square feet and an estimated investment of approximately $100.9 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into a mezzanine lending facility to provide development capital to a leading industrial developer for up to 85.0% loan-to-cost on new industrial developments in select markets. We believe that this allows us the opportunity to participate in strong industrial market fundamentals with a risk exposure more appropriate to our strategy. As of December 31, 2017, the carrying value of our loan investments was $22.2 million and the loan investments had an aggregate weighted average interest rate of 10.47%.
Other General Business Information
Operating Segments 
Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for the manner in which public enterprises report information about operating segments. In prior periods, we viewed and presented our operations as two segments, Investments/Corporate and Asset Management. However, based upon the significant reduction in our third-party asset management operations following the expiration of the KBS management contract as of March 31, 2017, we view our operations as one segment, which consists of net leasing operations. As of December 31, 2017, we had no other reportable segments.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 109 employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.

Environmental Matters 
We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition. We generally conduct environmental assessments of the properties we acquire, including land. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Compliance With The Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 
Many of the properties underlying our investments are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons as a result of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In addition, a number of additional federal, state and local laws may require modifications to any properties we purchase, or may restrict further renovations of our properties, with respect to access by disabled persons. Noncompliance with these laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. 
Insurance
We carry commercial liability and all risk property insurance, including where required, flood, earthquake, wind and terrorism coverage, on substantially all of the properties that we own. For certain net leased properties, however, we may rely on our tenant’s insurance and not maintain separate coverage. We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of specialty coverage, including flood, earthquake, wind and terrorism. We cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. We believe that the insured limits are appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice.
Substantially all of our properties are covered by an environmental insurance policy that expires in October 2019, and several of our properties are separately covered by individual insurance policies that have 10-year terms. These policies are subject to exclusions and limitations and do not cover all of the properties owned by us, and for those properties covered under the policies, insurance may not fully compensate us for any environmental liability. We may not desire to renew an environmental insurance policy in place upon expiration or a replacement policy may not be available at a reasonable cost, if at all.
