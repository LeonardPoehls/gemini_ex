Item 1. Business
All references to “we,” “our,” and “us” in this Annual Report refer to Quidel Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Overview
We have a leadership position in the development, manufacturing and marketing of rapid diagnostic testing solutions. These diagnostic testing solutions are separated into our four product categories, including: immunoassays, molecular assays, virology and specialty products. We sell our products directly to end users and distributors, in each case, for professional use in physician offices, hospitals, clinical laboratories, reference laboratories, leading universities, retail clinics, pharmacies and wellness screening centers. We market our products in the United States through a network of national and regional distributors, and through a direct sales force. Internationally, we market primarily through distributor arrangements.
We commenced our operations in 1979 and launched our first products, dipstick-based pregnancy tests, in 1983. Since such time, our product base and technology platforms have expanded through internal development and acquisitions of other products, technologies and companies. Our diagnostic solutions aid in the detection and diagnosis of many critical diseases and other medical conditions, including infectious diseases, women’s health, gastrointestinal diseases, autoimmune diseases, bone health and thyroid diseases. 
Corporate Information
We are a corporation, originally incorporated as Monoclonal Antibodies, Inc. in California in 1979 and re-incorporated as Quidel Corporation in the State of Delaware in 1987. Our executive offices are located at 12544 High Bluff Drive, Suite 200, San Diego, California 92130, and our telephone number is (858) 552-1100.

The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report and should not be considered part of this Annual Report. In addition, the SEC website contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information about us at www.sec.gov.
Business Strategy
Our primary objective is to increase shareholder value by building a broader-based diagnostic company capable of delivering revenue growth and consistent operating results. Our strategy is to identify potential market segments that provide, or are expected to provide, significant total market opportunities, and in which we can be successful by applying our significant expertise and know-how to develop differentiated technologies and products.
Our diagnostic testing solutions are designed to provide specialized results that serve a broad range of customers, by addressing the market requirements of ease of use, reduced cost, increased test accuracy and reduced time to result. Our current approach to address this diagnostic continuum relative to our strategy is comprised of the following:

• | rapid point-of-care immunoassay tests for use in physician offices, hospital laboratories and emergency departments, retail clinics, pharmacies and other urgent care or alternative site settings;


• | direct fluorescent assays (“DFA”) and culture-based tests for the clinical virology laboratory;


• | molecular diagnostic tests across a number of laboratory and other segments; and


• | specialty products serving the bone health, autoimmune and complement research communities.

Our current focus to accomplish our primary objective includes the following:


• | leveraging our current infrastructure to develop and launch new rapid immunoassays such as additional assays for our Sofia® Analyzer and next generation analyzer (Sofia 2);


• | developing a molecular diagnostics franchise that incorporates three distinct testing platforms, AmpliVue®, Solana® and Savanna™ and that leverages our molecular assay development competencies; and


• | strengthening our position with distribution partners and our end-user customers to gain more emphasis on our products in the U.S. and abroad.

Our current initiatives to execute this strategy include the following:

• | continue to provide products that can compete effectively in the healthcare market where cost is important;


• | continue to focus our research and development efforts on three areas:


• | new proprietary product platform development;


• | the creation of improved products and new products for existing markets and unmet clinical needs; and


• | pursuit of collaborations with, or acquisitions of, other companies for new and existing products and markets that advance our differentiated strategy.


• | provide clinicians with validated studies that encompass the clinical efficacy and economic efficiency of our diagnostic tests for the professional market;


• | strengthen our market and brand leadership in current markets by acquiring and/or developing and introducing clinically superior diagnostic solutions;


• | strengthen our direct sales force to enhance relationships with integrated delivery networks, laboratories and hospitals, with a goal of driving growth through improved physician and laboratorian satisfaction;


• | leverage our wireless connectivity and data management systems, including cloud-based tools;


• | support payer evaluation of diagnostic tests and establishment of favorable reimbursement rates;


• | continue to create strong global alliances to support our efforts to achieve leadership in key markets and expand our presence in emerging markets; and


• | further refine our manufacturing efficiencies and productivity improvements to improve profit, with continued focus on profitable products and markets and our efforts to leverage our core competency in new product development.

Product development activities are inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain regulatory body clearance to market any of our products, or if we obtain clearances, that we will successfully commercialize any of our products. In addition, we may terminate our development efforts with respect to one or more of our products under development at any time, including before or during clinical trials.
The Overall Market for In Vitro Diagnostics
Customers for In Vitro Diagnostics (“IVD”) products are primarily centralized laboratories and decentralized point-of-care settings.
Centralized testing market
The centralized in vitro diagnostic testing process typically involves obtaining a specimen of blood, urine or other sample from the patient and sending the sample from the healthcare provider’s office, hospital unit or clinic to a central laboratory. In a typical visit to the physician’s office, after the patient’s test specimen is collected, the patient is usually sent home and receives the results of the test several hours or days later. The result of this process is that the patient may leave the physician’s office without confirmation of the diagnosis and the opportunity to begin potentially more effective immediate care.
Decentralized POC market
Point-of-care (“POC”) testing for certain diseases has become an accepted adjunct to central laboratory and self-testing. The professional POC market is comprised of two general segments: decentralized testing in non-institutional settings, such as physicians’ offices, and hospital testing (e.g., emergency rooms and bedside).


• | Hospital POC testing is accepted and growing and is generally an extension of the hospital’s central laboratory. Hospitals in the U.S. have progressively sought to reduce the length of patient stays and, consequently, the proportion of cases seen as outpatients have increased. If the U.S. experience is representative of future trends, emergency departments and other critical care units such as intensive care units, operating rooms, trauma and cardiac centers are increasingly becoming the principal centers for the management of moderate and severe acute illness.


• | Out-of-hospital testing sites consist of physicians’ office laboratories, nursing homes, pharmacies, retail clinics and other non-institutional, ambulatory settings in which healthcare providers perform diagnostic tests.

This decentralized POC market encompasses a large variety of IVD products ranging from moderate-sized instrumented diagnostic systems serving larger group practices to single-use, disposable tests. We believe POC testing is increasing due to its clinical benefit, fast results, cost-effectiveness and patient satisfaction.
5

We believe that the growth in POC testing is in part due to evolving technological improvements creating high quality tests with laboratory accuracy and POC ease-of-use, some of which are capable of being granted a waiver under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”).
Products
We provide diagnostic testing solutions under various brand names, including, among others, the following: Quidel®, QuickVue®, QuickVue+®, Sofia®, AmpliVue®, Solana®, Virena®, MicroVueTM, Lyra®, FreshCellsTM, D3®, FastPoint®, ReadyCells®, Super E-MixTM, ELVIRA®, ELVIS® and Thyretain®.
System Platforms:
Our diagnostic testing solutions are separated into our four product categories: immunoassay, molecular, virology and specialty products. The key platforms are described below:
Immunoassays

We have been a leader in the development and production of high quality lateral flow diagnostics since the early 1990s and offer a broad portfolio of products to diagnose a wide variety of infectious diseases and medical conditions.
Sofia Analyzer. Sofia is the brand name for our fluorescent immunoassay (“FIA”) system. The easy-to-use Sofia Analyzer combines unique software, when used in conjunction with Sofia FIA tests, to yield an automatic, objective result that is readily available on the instrument’s screen, in a hard-copy printout, and in a transmissible electronic form that can network via a lab information system to hospital and medical center databases. The Sofia FIA tests employ advanced lateral flow and immunofluorescence technologies to provide enhanced performance for several assays as noted in our disease state discussion below. The Sofia Analyzer provides for different operational modes to accommodate both small and large laboratories as well as other features designed to facilitate use in a variety of healthcare settings, including hospitals, medical centers, and small clinics.
Next Generation Analyzer. We are developing the next generation Sofia Analyzer (Sofia 2) with added benefits and features and at a cost point that allows us to better address the lower-volume segment of the diagnostic testing market. We believe users will see an improvement in individual test performance and workflow. Enhanced optics are designed to provide added performance benefits and kinetic reading is designed to enable positive test results to be read in as short as a few minutes. Similar to the original Sofia Analyzer, the next generation analyzer is planned to initially center around respiratory assays and then extend into Lyme Disease and Vitamin D tests.
Molecular
Lyra. Our open system molecular assays run on several thermocyclers currently on the market. We have several existing Lyra Molecular Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR”) assays that provide important benefits to the customer, including, among others, room temperature storage, reduced process time, and ready-to-use reagent configurations. These include several assays as noted in our disease state discussion below.
AmpliVue. With our Molecular AmpliVue hand-held molecular diagnostic assay platform, the detection of the pathogen is achieved using a hand-held, fully contained cassette that combines isothermal Helicase Dependent Amplification (“HDA”) with lateral flow detection technology, and is currently used in several assays also noted in our disease state discussion below.
Solana. The Solana system was developed as an extension to the AmpliVue product line, running the same proprietary HDA technology. Solana is an easy to run amplification and detection system that has the ability to concurrently run up to 12 assays at a time.
Savanna. We are developing the Savanna system as a rugged, low-cost, fully-integrated system with novel extraction, and sample in/result out simplicity. The system is expected to be able to run either PCR or HDA assays from multiple sample types.

Our Solana Strep Complete and Solana Group A Strep assays allow for the rapid, accurate detection of Group A and pyogenic Group C/G Strep and Group A Strep, respectively, utilizing our molecular HDA technology. In addition, our Lyra Direct Strep Assay is a multiplex real-time PCR assay that detects and differentiates between pyogenic Group A and pyogenic C or G Streptococcal throat infections. 
RSV. Our Sofia RSV test and our QuickVue RSV test are rapid immunoassay tests for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (“RSV”). Quidel also offers our combo Quidel Molecular RSV + human metapneumovirus (hMPV) test. The majority of upper respiratory tract infections in children are caused by viruses, and RSV is generally recognized as a frequent agent responsible for these infections.
Herpes and Herpes Family. We offer a variety of products designed to detect various herpes simplex virus (“HSV”) and herpes family viruses utilizing molecular and cell culture technologies. In the fall of 2016, we obtained FDA clearance of our Solana HSV-1+2/VZV Assay, used in conjunction with our Solana instrument, for the detection of HSV type 1, HSV type 2, and varicella-zoster virus (“VZV”). We also offer our Lyra Direct HSV 1+2/VZV and AmpliVue HSV 1+2 assays. In addition, our proprietary engineered cell culture system, ELVIS HSV, is an FDA cleared and highly sensitive system for the isolation and detection of HSV types 1 and 2. We also provide a multiplex cell culture solution using a propriety cell platform called H&V-MixTM that is used to isolate HSV, VZV and Cytomegalovirus, all in the herpes family of viruses. Antibody detection and identification of each of these viruses can be performed with FDA cleared antibody products provided under the D3 DFA brand. HSV is a widespread sexually transmitted infection. VZV is a DNA virus of the family Herpesviridae; infection results 
7

in chickenpox (varicella) and may lead to complications such as pneumonia and may reactivate later in life to produce shingles. 
Multiplex Respiratory. Our cell culture and DFA detection solutions, including D3 FastPoint technology, are used by reference laboratories, public health labs and acute care hospitals to detect eight major viral respiratory pathogens. Our proprietary cell culture platform R-MixTM combined with our D3 Ultra DFA antibody kit, detects Influenza A and B, RSV, Adenovirus and Parainfluenza types 1, 2 and 3, with turn-around times between 16 and 48 hours. The same D3 Ultra DFA antibody kit can also be used for direct specimen testing for those viruses with turn-around times in less than 90 minutes. Our D3 FastPoint antibody kit detects eight viruses, with human metapneumovirus added to the testing menu, and provides laboratories, in a direct specimen testing format, the ability to produce virus identification in less than 25 minutes from specimen receipt.
S. pneomoniae. Our Sofia S. Pneomoniae FIA, used in conjunction with our Sofia Analyzer, was CE Marked for sale in the European market in 2016. The assay is used to aid in the detection of both pneumococcal pneumonia and pneumococccal menigitis. Streptoccus pneumoniae is a leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia and bacterial meningitis. 
Legionella. Our Sofia Legionella FIA, used in conjunction with our Sofia Analyzer, is CE Marked for sale in the European market. The assay is used to aid in the detection of Legionella pneumophila seorgroup 1 antigen, which is the major causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, a disease primarily of pneumonia.
Bordetella Pertussis. In 2014, we received FDA clearance for our AmpliVue Bordetella Assay, used in detection of Bordetella pertussis. Pertussis, or whooping cough, is a very contagious disease of caused by the Bordetella pertussis bacteria and there has been increasing incidence in recent years. 
Adenovirus and Parainfluenza. Quidel offers the Lyra Adenovirus Assay, a real-time PCR test for the qualitative detection of human adenovirus (HAdV) viral DNA, and our Lyra Parainfluenza Assay, a real-time PCR test for the qualitative detection and identification of Parainfluenza virus infections for types 1, 2 or 3 viral RNA.
POC Women’s and General Health
Pregnancy. Our Sofia hCG fluorescent immunoassay and our QuickVue pregnancy tests are used for the qualitative detection of hCG in serum or urine for the early detection of pregnancy. The early detection of pregnancy enables the physician and patient to institute proper care, helping to promote the health of both the woman and the developing embryo.
Graves Disease. Our FDA cleared bioassay called Thyretain is used for the differential diagnosis of an autoimmune disease called Graves Disease. Graves Disease is caused by antibodies that stimulate the thyroid hormone receptors to create a hyperthyroid condition causing symptoms that include heart palpitations, unexplained weight loss, anxiety, depression and fatigue. Graves Disease is considered the most common autoimmune disorder in the U.S. according to an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine and it predominantly affects women. Thyretain is sold to reference laboratories and select acute care hospitals and has been successfully deployed on automated testing platforms.
Chlamydia. Our QuickVue Chlamydia test is a lateral flow immunoassay for the rapid, qualitative detection of Chlamydia trachomatis from endocervical swab and cytology brush specimens. The test is intended for use as an aid in the presumptive diagnosis of Chlamydia. Chlamydia trachomatis is responsible for the most widespread sexually transmitted disease in the U.S. Over one-half of infected women do not have symptoms and, if left untreated, Chlamydia trachomatis can cause sterility.
Trichomonas. In 2016, we obtained FDA clearance of our Solana Trichomonas assay, used in conjunction with our Solana instrument, to aid in the diagnosis of trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted disease attributable to infection from the Trichomonas vaginalis parasite. Trichomoniasis affects millions of people in the U.S., is more common in women and can be treated with antibiotics upon diagnosis.
Bone Health. Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of the microarchitecture of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures. The risk for fracture increases exponentially with age. A key set of parameters in the monitoring of osteoporosis, both before and after therapy, are biochemical markers of bone metabolism. As a leader in the research space with our biomarkers for bone health, we produce both clinical and research products for the assessment of osteoporosis and the evaluation of bone resorption/formation, which, including our metabolic bone markers, are used by physicians to monitor the effectiveness of therapy in pharmaceutical and related research.
Gastrointestinal Diseases
Clostridium difficile. Our Lyra Direct C. difficile Assay, is a qualitative, multiplexed real-time PCR test for the detection of Clostridium difficile Toxin A or Toxin B genes and is approved for use on a variety of real-time PCR instruments. We also sell our AmpliVue C. difficile Assay, utilizing our HDA technology, for the detection of the Clostridium difficile Toxin A gene. 
8

Clostridium difficile (“C. diff”) is a life threatening bacterial infection, especially for the elderly and patients on a prolonged antibiotic regimen. Currently more than 500,000 cases of C. diff infections are diagnosed each year in the U.S.
Enterovirus. Enteroviruses reproduce initially in the gastrointestinal tract before spreading to other organs such as the nervous system, heart and skin. Enteroviruses can also infect the respiratory tract. Enteroviruses such as Coxsackievirus A16 are referred to as Hand Foot and Mouth disease and commonly affect infants and children. Our indirect fluorescent antibody (“IFA”) products sold under the name Super E-Mix and D3 IFA Enterovirus kit are used by reference laboratories and acute care hospitals.
Immunoassay fecal occult blood.  Our QuickVue fecal immunochemical test (“FIT”) is a rapid test intended to detect the presence of blood in stool specimens. Blood in the stool is an indication of a number of gastrointestinal disorders, including colorectal cancer. 
Helicobacter pylori (“H. pylori”). H. pylori is the bacterium associated with approximately 80% of patients diagnosed with peptic ulcers in the U.S. H. pylori is implicated in chronic gastritis and is recognized by the World Health Organization as a Class 1 carcinogen that may increase a person’s risk of developing stomach cancer. Our QuickVue rapid test is a serological test that measures antibodies circulating in the blood caused by the immune response to the H. pylori bacterium.
Seasonality
Sales of our infectious disease products are subject to, and significantly affected by, the seasonal demands of the cold and flu seasons, prevalent during the fall and winter. As a result of these seasonal demands, we typically experience lower sales volume in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, and typically have higher sales in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Historically, sales of our infectious disease products have varied from year to year based in large part on the severity, length and timing of the onset of the cold and flu season. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, sales of our infectious disease products accounted for 71%, 73% and 71%, respectively, of total revenue.
Research and Development
We continue to focus our research and development efforts on three areas:

• | new proprietary product platform development,


• | the creation of improved products and new products for existing markets and unmet clinical needs, and


• | pursuit of collaborations with, or acquisitions of, other companies for new and existing products and markets that advance our differentiated strategy.

Research and development expenses were approximately $38.7 million, $35.5 million, and $37.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to devote a significant amount of financial resources to product and technology research and development for the foreseeable future.
Marketing and Distribution
Our business strategy is designed around serving the continuum of healthcare delivery needs starting with POC clinicians located in small doctor’s office practices to moderately complex POLs through the highly complex environment in hospital and clinical reference laboratories.
Within the inherent operational diversity of these various segments, we focus on ensuring market leadership and providing points of differentiation by specializing in the diagnosis and monitoring of selected disease states. Our marketing strategy includes ensuring that our key product portfolios are supported by clinical validation and health economic and outcomes research that demonstrates to hospitals, laboratories, acute care facilities and POC clinicians that these tests deliver fast, high quality results, are cost-effective to use, and improve patient outcomes.
Our distribution strategy takes into account the fact that the U.S. POC market is highly fragmented, with many small or medium-sized customers. A network of national and regional distributors is utilized, combined with our own sales force, to reach customers using POC diagnostic tests. We have developed priority status with several of the major distributors in the U.S., resulting in many of our products having preferred product status with these distributors.
We have expanded the size of our U.S. sales force in the past few years. As of December 31, 2016, we employed more than 100 U.S. sales representatives. We are utilizing this expanded sales force to work closely with our key distributors to drive market penetration of our products in the U.S. POC market, with a particular focus on addressing acute care and integrated delivery network customers. 
9

The sales, distribution and service of our cell culture and molecular diagnostic tests are controlled primarily by us. Laboratory end-users in hospitals and clinical reference laboratories utilizing these diagnostic tests are reached through our own direct sales force and technical support services that have specialized training and understanding of the product portfolio.
Internationally, the use of professional rapid POC diagnostic tests, the acceptance of testing outside the central laboratory, the regulatory requirements to sell POC tests and consumer interest in over-the-counter and self-test products, differ considerably from the U.S. Our international sales are significantly lower than domestic sales, largely due to the POC market being more developed in the U.S. relative to the overall IVD market in other countries.
We derive a significant portion of our total revenue from a relatively small number of distributors. Three of our distributors, which are considered to be among the market leaders, collectively accounted for approximately 44%, 48% and 48% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These distributors were McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and Fisher Scientific Company (“Fisher”).
See Note 7 “Industry and Geographic Information” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.
Manufacturing
We have two primary manufacturing sites. These two sites are in San Diego, California and Athens, Ohio. Our San Diego facility consists of laboratories devoted to tissue culture, cell culture, protein purification and immunochemistry and production areas dedicated to manufacturing and assembly. In the manufacturing process, biological and chemical supplies and equipment are used. Since the year 2000, the San Diego facility has operated under a Quality Management System certified to the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 9001 certification. During 2005, we became certified to the ISO 13485:2003 Regulatory Standard as required for medical device manufacturers distributing product within the European Union and other countries. Many of the immunoassay products manufactured in our San Diego facility are packaged and shipped by a local third party.
Our Athens facility consists of a molecular manufacturing laboratory dedicated to the manufacture and assembly of our molecular products, clean rooms (FS-209E Class 1000: ISO Class 6) for the culturing and dispensing of cell cultures under cGMP conditions and laboratories devoted to tissue culture for the production of monoclonal antibodies and the development and manufacture of research and MicroVue products. In the manufacturing process, biological and chemical supplies are used, as well as specialized equipment. The facility is also certified to the ISO 13485:2003 medical device standard. Packaging and shipping logistics are also handled at the facility. 
We seek to conduct all of our manufacturing in compliance with the FDA Quality System Regulations (“QSR”) (formerly Good Manufacturing Practices) governing the manufacture of medical devices. Our manufacturing facilities have been registered with the FDA and the Department of Health Services of the State of California for our San Diego facility (the “State FDA”), and have passed routine federal and state inspections confirming compliance with the QSR regulatory requirements.
Government Regulation
Regulation in the United States
The testing, manufacture and commercialization of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. Pursuant to the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the FDA regulates the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution and promotion of medical devices. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in, among other matters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the FDA to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices, withdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request a recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed in the U.S. if the device is deemed to be unsafe.
In the U.S., devices are classified into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) on the basis of the controls deemed necessary by the FDA to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I and II devices are subject to general controls including, but not limited to, performance standards, premarket notification (“510(k)”) and post market surveillance. Class III devices generally pose the highest risk to the patient and are typically subject to premarket approval to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Our current products are all Class I or II.
10

Prior to commercialization in the U.S. market, manufacturers must obtain FDA clearance through a premarket notification or premarket approval process, which can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The FDA has been requiring more rigorous demonstration of product performance as part of the 510(k) process, including submission of extensive clinical data. It generally takes from three to six months to obtain clearance but may take longer. A premarket approval application must be supported by valid scientific evidence to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device, typically including the results of clinical investigations, bench tests and reference laboratory studies. In addition, modifications or enhancements for existing products that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness, or constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, will require new submissions to the FDA.
On January 30, 2008, the FDA issued guidance entitled “Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Recommendation for CLIA waiver applications.” The guidance sets forth new requirements for obtaining a CLIA waiver that are onerous and have increased the time and cost required to obtain a CLIA waiver.
Any devices we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA clearance or approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies, including adherence to QSR relating to testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements. We must also comply with Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”) requirements mandating reporting to the FDA of any incident in which a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or in which a device malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Current FDA enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses.
Regulation Outside of the United States
For marketing outside the U.S., we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing and marketing approval for our products. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the U.S., and may require us to perform additional or different preclinical or clinical testing regardless of whether we have obtained FDA approval. The amount of time required to obtain necessary approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In many foreign countries, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required.
Our initial focus for obtaining marketing approval outside the U.S. is typically the European Union (the “EU”), Japan and China. EU Regulations and Directives generally classify healthcare products either as medicinal products, medical devices or in vitro diagnostics. The CE Mark certification for the EU requires us to receive ISO certification for the manufacture of our products. This certification comes only after the development of an all-inclusive quality system, which is reviewed for compliance with ISO standards by a licensed body working within the EU. After certification is received, a technical file is developed which attests to the product’s compliance with EU directive 98/79/EC for in vitro diagnostic medical devices. Only after this point is the product CE marked. Japanese regulations require registration of in vitro diagnostic products with the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Chinese regulations require registration of diagnostic products with the China FDA, or CFDA. Additional clinical trials are typically required for registration purposes. For products marketed in Canada, registration is required with Health Canada and we have our independent party certification under the Canadian Medical Device Regulation.
Intellectual Property
The healthcare industry has traditionally placed considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for commercially relevant technologies, devices, products and processes. We and other companies engaged in research and development of new diagnostic products actively pursue patents for technologies that are considered novel and patentable. However, important factors, many of which are not within our control, can affect whether and to what extent patent protection in the U.S. and in other important markets worldwide is obtained. By way of example, the speed, accuracy and consistency in application of the law in a patent office within any particular jurisdiction is beyond our control and can be unpredictable. The resolution of issues such as these and their effect upon our long-term success is likewise indeterminable. We have issued patents, both in the U.S. and internationally, with expiration dates ranging from the present through approximately 2034 and have patent applications pending throughout the world.
It has been our policy to file for patent protection in the U.S. and other countries with significant markets, such as Western European countries and Japan, if the economics are deemed to justify such filing and our patent counsel advises that relevant patent protection may be obtained.
11

A large number of individuals and commercial enterprises seek patent protection for technologies, products and processes in fields in, or related to, our areas of product development. To the extent such efforts are successful, we may be required to obtain licenses and pay significant royalties in order to exploit certain of our product strategies and avoid a material adverse effect on our business. Licenses may not be available to us at all or, if so available, may not be available on acceptable terms.
We are aware of certain patents issued to various developers of diagnostic products with potential applicability to our diagnostic technology. We have licensed certain rights from certain companies to assist with the manufacturing of certain products. In the future, we expect that we will require or desire additional licenses from other parties in order to refine our products further and to allow us to develop, manufacture and market commercially viable or superior products effectively.
We seek to protect our trade secrets and technology by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties (such as potential licensees, customers, strategic partners and consultants). In addition, we have implemented certain security measures in our laboratories and offices. Also, to the extent that consultants or contracting parties apply technical or scientific information independently developed by them to our projects, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such data.
Under many of our contractual agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the counterparty against costs and liabilities arising out of any patent infringement claims and other intellectual property claims asserted by a third party relating to products sold under those agreements.
Competition
Competition in the development and marketing of IVD products is intense, and innovation, product development, regulatory clearance to market and commercial introduction of new IVD technologies can occur rapidly. We believe that some of the most significant competitive factors in the rapid diagnostic market include convenience, speed to result, specimen flexibility, product menu, clinical needs, price, reimbursement and product performance as well as effective distribution, advertising, promotion and brand name recognition. The competitive factors in the central laboratory market are also significant and include price, product performance, reimbursement, compatibility with routine specimen procurement methods, and manufacturing products in testing formats that meet the workflow demands of larger volume laboratories. We believe our success will depend on our ability to remain abreast of technological advances, to develop, gain regulatory clearance and introduce technologically advanced products, to effectively market to customers a differentiated value proposition represented by our commercialized products, to maintain our brand strength and to attract and retain experienced personnel. The majority of diagnostic tests requested by physicians and other healthcare providers are performed by independent clinical reference laboratories. These laboratories, we expect, will continue to compete vigorously to maintain their dominance of the testing market. In order to achieve market acceptance for our products, we will be required to continue to demonstrate that our products provide physicians and central laboratories cost-effective and time-saving alternatives to competitive products and technologies.
Many of our current and prospective commercial competitors, including several large pharmaceutical and diversified healthcare companies, have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. These competitors include, among others, Alere Inc. (“Alere”), Beckman Coulter Primary Care Diagnostics, Fisher, Becton Dickinson and Company, Meridian Bioscience, Inc., Danaher Corporation and Chemicon International, Inc. We also face competition from our distributors since some have created, and others may decide to create, their own products to compete with ours. Competition may also be provided from large, medium and small development companies whose portfolio and technologies are dedicated to the development of diagnostic solutions in areas in which we currently have relevant market share.
