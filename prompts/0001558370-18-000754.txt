 Item 1. Business
         Overview
     The Company is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Denver, Colorado. Through our subsidiary companies, we combine elements of personalized service found in community banks with sophisticated financial products and services traditionally offered by larger regional banks that we market to our targeted customer base of professionals, high-net-worth individuals and small to mid-sized businesses. At December 31, 2017, we had total assets of $3.8 billion, net loans of $3.1 billion and deposits of $3.2 billion. We were incorporated in Colorado in 1980.  
     Our wholly-owned subsidiary “the Bank” is a full-service business banking institution serving two markets, Colorado and Arizona. In Colorado, the Bank operates under the name Colorado Business Bank and has 11 locations, including seven in the Denver metropolitan area, and one each in Boulder, Colorado Springs, Fort Collins and Vail.  In Arizona, the Bank operates under the name Arizona Business Bank and has four locations serving the Phoenix metropolitan area and the surrounding area of Maricopa County. Each of the Bank’s locations is led by a local president with substantial decision-making authority. We support our bank and fee-based businesses with back-office services from our downtown Denver offices. 
     Our banking products are complemented by our fee-based business lines.  Through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions, our fee-based business lines have grown to include employee benefits brokerage and consulting, insurance brokerage, and wealth management services. We believe offering such complementary products allows us to both broaden our relationships with existing customers and attract new customers to our core business.
     Segments
     We operate three distinct segments, as follows:
    
· | Commercial Banking

 Business Strategy 
     Our primary strategy is to build long-term relationships that meet the needs of small to mid-sized businesses, business owners and professionals in high-growth Western markets. In all areas of our operations, we focus on attracting and retaining the highest-quality personnel by maintaining an environment which allows our employees to effectively respond to customer needs and manage those relationships.  In order to realize our strategic objectives, we are pursuing the following strategies:
     Organic growth. We believe the Colorado and Arizona markets provide us with significant long-term opportunities for organic growth. These markets continue to be dominated by a number of large regional and national financial institutions.  There are gaps in the banking industry’s ability to serve certain customers in these market areas because small and medium-sized businesses often are not large enough to warrant significant marketing focus and customer service from large banks. In addition, we believe these banks often do not satisfy the needs of professionals and high-net-worth individuals who desire personal attention from experienced bankers. Similarly, many of the remaining community banks in the region do not provide the sophisticated banking products and services such customers require. Through our ability to combine personalized service, experienced personnel who are established in their community, sophisticated technology and a broad product line, we believe we will continue to achieve strong organic growth by attracting customers currently banking at both larger and smaller financial institutions and by expanding our business with existing customers.  
     The following table details the Company’s market share of deposits in Colorado and Arizona, as well as other banks headquartered in our market areas and out-of-state banks as reported by the FDIC and S&P Global Market Intelligence at June 30, 2017 and 2016, the most recent information available.

      Loan portfolio growth and diversification.  We have emphasized expanding our overall loan products in order to diversify and grow the loan portfolio.  In recent years, we have had growth initiatives focused on the following lending areas: residential mortgage, public finance, structured finance and healthcare.  These products have enabled the Bank to continue to grow its loan portfolio in a competitive and challenging environment.
     Establishing strong brand awareness. We have developed a cohesive and comprehensive approach to our internal and external communications efforts to leverage the power of each subsidiary as part of the larger company.  Our brand platform has unified the look and feel of the CoBiz identity across the Company. With a 

 
  6

 
target market that is similar across subsidiaries, our strong brand awareness helps generate cross-sell opportunities while strengthening client relationships.
     Expanding existing banking relationships. We are normally not a transactional lender.  Instead, we focus on a consultative approach, developing a specific suite of products and services to meet customer needs.  We believe the depth of our customer relationships provides us the opportunity to introduce the broader array of the products and services we offer and generate additional noninterest income. In addition, we believe this philosophy aids in customer retention. 
     Maintaining asset quality. We seek to maintain asset quality through a program that includes regular reviews of loans and ongoing monitoring of the loan portfolio by a loan review department that reports to an Executive Vice President of the Company but submits reports directly to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. At December 31, 2017, our ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.25%, compared to 0.11% at December 31, 2016.  
     Controlling interest rate risk. We seek to control our exposure to changing interest rates by maintaining a favorable match between the maturities or repricing dates of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  We actively monitor our interest rate profile in regular meetings of our ALCO.
     Focus on cost and process efficiencies.  We have heavily invested in our current infrastructure in order to position us for future growth across all of our business units.  In 2017, we invested resources in evaluating the entire lending process, including origination, customer onboarding, credit underwriting, recording and small business lending.  Based on those evaluations, we implemented various changes to increase efficiencies, reduce cost and enhance customer experiences.  We have also evaluated our facility plan and implemented changes to reduce the overall rentable square feet per employee without impacting customer service.  This evaluation resulted in the relocation of our principal executive offices in 2016, the closure of one bank location in 2016 and another in 2017.
     Expansion. Our approach to expansion is predicated on recruiting key personnel to lead new initiatives. While we normally consider an array of new locations and product lines as potential expansion initiatives, we will generally proceed only upon identifying quality management personnel with a loyal customer following in the community or experienced in the product line that is the target of the initiative. We believe focusing on individuals who are established in their communities and experienced in offering sophisticated financial products and services will enhance our market position and add growth opportunities.  As we continually evaluate our facility plan, we look to consolidate and close the locations that are able to be serviced by other offices.  However, we also evaluate the opening of new bank locations in markets that we are not currently serving.  In 2014, we opened bank locations in two new markets in Colorado, Fort Collins and Colorado Springs.  
     Market Areas Served
     We operate in two western markets in the United States – Colorado and Arizona. These markets are currently dominated by a number of large regional and national financial institutions. The Company’s success is dependent to a significant degree on the economic conditions of these two geographical markets.

      Competition
     CoBiz and its subsidiaries face competition in all principal business activities, not only from other financial holding companies and commercial banks, but also from savings and loan associations, credit unions, asset-based lenders, financial technology companies, finance companies, mortgage companies, leasing companies, insurance companies, investment advisors, mutual funds, securities brokers and dealers, other domestic and foreign financial institutions, and various nonfinancial institutions.  
     Please see “Risk Factors” below, as well as the market share information provided above for additional information.
     Employees
     We had 538 full time equivalent employees at December 31, 2017.  Employees of the Company are entitled to participate in a variety of employee benefit programs, including: equity plans; an employee stock purchase plan; a 401(k) plan; various comprehensive medical, accident and group life insurance plans; and paid vacations. No Company employee is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees to be excellent.     Supervision and Regulation
     CoBiz and the Bank are extensively regulated under federal, Colorado and Arizona law. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, borrowers and federal deposit insurance funds, not 

 
  8

 
shareholders of CoBiz. The following information summarizes certain material statutes and regulations affecting CoBiz, the Bank and the Fee-Based Lines, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. Any change in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory policies may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of CoBiz and the Bank. We are unable to predict the nature or extent of the effects that fiscal or monetary policies, economic controls, or new federal or state legislation may have on our business and earnings in the future.
     The Holding Company
     General. CoBiz is a financial holding company registered under the BHCA, and is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve. CoBiz is required to file an annual report with the Federal Reserve and such other reports as may be required pursuant to the BHCA.
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934. CoBiz has a class of securities registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act. The Exchange Act requires the Company to file periodic reports with the SEC, governs the Company’s disclosure in proxy solicitations and regulates insider trading transactions.  The Company is listed on the Nasdaq and is subject to the rules of the Nasdaq.
     Dodd-Frank Act.  On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act comprehensively reforms the regulation of financial institutions, products and services.  Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been the subject of proposed and final rules by the SEC, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve.  However, the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business and operations will not be known until all regulations on the statute are written and adopted or reforms proposed for the Dodd-Frank Act are implemented. The Dodd-Frank Act may have a material impact on our operations, particularly through increased compliance costs resulting from possible future consumer and fair lending regulations.  In October 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, issued the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule which is effective for new consumer real estate loan applications.  
     Sound Incentive Compensation Policies.  In 2010, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC issued final guidance to help ensure that incentive compensation policies at banking organizations do not encourage imprudent risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization.  The key principles within the guidance on incentive compensation arrangements are 1) they should appropriately balance risk and financial results to not encourage imprudent risk; 2) they should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and 3) they should be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the board of directors.  The guidance applies to all employees who individually, or as part of a group, have the ability to expose the organization to material amounts of risk.  At a minimum, these rules apply to named executive officers included within a public company’s executive compensation disclosures.  The Federal Reserve reviews the Company’s policies and procedures for incentive compensation arrangements as part of the supervisory process.
     In June 2016, the banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The proposed rule is intended to (1) prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss, (2) require the board of directors to conduct oversight of the covered institution’s incentive-based compensation program, approve incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive officers and approve material exceptions or adjustments to incentive-based compensation policies or arrangements for senior executive officers, and (3) require those financial institutions to disclose information concerning incentive-based compensation arrangements to the appropriate Federal regulator. The proposed rule applies to any covered institution with average total consolidated assets greater than or equal to $1 billion that offers incentive-based compensation to covered persons.

 Acquisitions. As a financial holding company, we are required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of a bank or bank holding company. The FRB will not approve any acquisition, merger or consolidation that would result in substantial anti-competitive effects, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are outweighed by a greater public interest in meeting the needs and convenience of the public. In reviewing applications for such transactions, the FRB also considers managerial, financial, capital and other factors, including the record of performance of the applicant and the bank or banks to be acquired under the CRA. See “The Bank — Community Reinvestment Act” below.
     Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 eliminates many of the restrictions placed on the activities of certain qualified financial or bank holding companies. A “financial holding company” such as CoBiz can expand into a wide variety of financial services, including securities activities, insurance and merchant banking without the prior approval of the FRB, provided that certain conditions are met, including a requirement that all subsidiary depository institutions be “well-capitalized.”
     Dividend Restrictions.  Dividends on the Company’s capital stock (common and preferred stock) are prohibited under the terms of the junior subordinated debenture agreements (see Note 9 – Long-Term Debt) if the Company is in continuous default on its payment obligations to the capital trusts, has elected to defer interest payments on the debentures or extends the interest payment period.  At December 31, 2017, the Company was not in default, had not elected to defer interest payments and had not extended the interest payment period on any of the subordinated debt issuances.  
     Support of Banks. As discussed below, the Bank is also subject to capital adequacy requirements. Under the FDICIA, CoBiz could be required to guarantee the capital restoration plan of the Bank if the Bank becomes “undercapitalized” as defined in the FDICIA and the regulations thereunder. See “Capital Adequacy at the Holding Company and Bank.”  Our maximum liability under any such guarantee would be the lesser of 5% of the Bank’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to bring the Bank into compliance with the capital plan. The FRB also has stated that financial or bank holding companies are subject to the “source of strength doctrine,” which requires such holding companies to serve as a source of “financial and managerial” strength to their subsidiary banks and to not conduct operations in an unsafe or unsound manner.
     The FDICIA requires the federal banking regulators to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to capital-deficient institutions. In addition to requiring the submission of a capital restoration plan, the FDICIA contains broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions involving asset growth, acquisitions, branch establishment and expansion into new lines of business. With certain exceptions, an insured depository institution is prohibited from making capital distributions, including dividends, and is prohibited from paying management fees to control persons, if the institution would be undercapitalized after any such distribution or payment.
     Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is intended to address systemic and structural weaknesses of the capital markets in the United States that were perceived to have contributed to corporate scandals. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also attempts to enhance the responsibility of corporate management by, among other things, (i) requiring the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of public companies to provide certain certifications in their periodic reports regarding the accuracy of the periodic reports filed with the SEC, (ii) prohibiting officers and directors of public companies from fraudulently influencing an accountant engaged in the audit of the company’s financial statements, (iii) requiring chief executive officers and chief financial officers to forfeit certain bonuses in the event of a restatement of financial results, (iv) prohibiting officers and directors found to be unfit from serving in a similar capacity with other public companies, (v) prohibiting officers and directors from trading in the company’s equity securities during pension blackout periods, and (vi) requiring the SEC to issue standards of professional conduct for attorneys representing public companies. In addition, public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange or association must satisfy the following additional requirements: (a) the company’s audit committee must appoint and oversee the company’s auditors; (b) each member of the company’s audit committee must be independent; 

 
  10

 
(c) the company’s audit committee must establish procedures for receiving complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls and audit-related matters; (d) the company’s audit committee must have the authority to engage independent advisors; and (e) the company must provide appropriate funding to its audit committee, as determined by the audit committee.  
     The Bank
     General. The Bank is a state-chartered banking institution, the deposits of which are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC, and is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Colorado Division of Banking, the FRB and the FDIC. Pursuant to such regulations, the Bank is subject to special restrictions, supervisory requirements and potential enforcement actions. The FRB’s supervisory authority over CoBiz can also affect the Bank.
     Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA requires the Bank to adequately meet the credit needs of the communities in which it operates. The CRA allows regulators to reject an applicant seeking, among other things, to make an acquisition or establish a branch, unless it has performed satisfactorily under the CRA. Federal regulators regularly conduct examinations to assess the performance of financial institutions under the CRA. In its most recent CRA examination, the Bank received a satisfactory rating.
     USA Patriot Act of 2001. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA Patriot Act) is intended to allow the federal government to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money-laundering requirements.
     Among its provisions, the USA Patriot Act requires each financial institution to: (i) establish an anti-money-laundering program; (ii) establish due diligence policies, procedures and controls with respect to its private banking accounts and correspondent banking accounts involving foreign individuals and certain foreign banks; and (iii) avoid establishing, maintaining, administering or managing correspondent accounts in the United States for, or on behalf of, a foreign bank that does not have a physical presence in any country. In addition, the USA Patriot Act contains a provision encouraging cooperation among financial institutions, regulatory authorities and law enforcement authorities with respect to individuals, entities and organizations engaged in, or reasonably suspected of engaging in, terrorist acts or money laundering activities. Financial institutions must comply with Section 326 of the Act which provides minimum procedures for identification verification of new customers.  In March 2006, the USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 made permanent 14 of the original provisions of the USA Patriot Act that had been set to expire. 
     Transactions with Affiliates. The Bank is subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, which limits the amount of loans to, investments in and certain other transactions with affiliates of the Bank; requires certain levels of collateral for such loans or transactions; and limits the amount of advances to third parties that are collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates, unless the affiliate is a bank and is at least 80% owned by the Company. If the affiliate is a bank and is at least 80% owned by the Company, such transactions are generally exempted from these restrictions except as to “low quality” assets as defined under the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions not consistent with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, Section 23A generally limits transactions with a single affiliate of the Bank to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus and generally limits all transactions with affiliates to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus.
     Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act requires that certain transactions between the Bank and any affiliate must be on substantially the same terms, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with, or involving, non-affiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to, or would apply to, non-affiliated companies. The aggregate amount of the Bank’s loans to its officers, directors and principal shareholders (or their affiliates) is limited to the amount of its unimpaired capital and surplus, unless the FDIC determines that a lesser amount is appropriate.
    
 
  11

 

 A violation of the restrictions of Section 23A or Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act may result in the assessment of civil monetary penalties against the Bank or a person participating in the conduct of the affairs of the Bank or the imposition of an order to cease and desist such violation.
     Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Act addresses the application of Sections 23A and 23B to credit exposure arising out of derivative transactions between an insured institution and its affiliates and intra-day extensions of credit by an insured depository institution to its affiliates. The rule requires institutions to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to monitor, manage and control credit exposures arising out of transactions and to clarify that the transactions are subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. 
     Anti-Tying Restrictions. Bank holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by a holding company or its affiliates. 
     Dividend Restrictions. Dividends paid by the Bank and management fees from the Bank and our Fee-Based Lines provide substantially all of the Company’s cash flow. The approval of the Colorado Division of Banking is required prior to the declaration of any dividend by the Bank if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits of that year combined with the retained net profits for the preceding two years. In addition, the FDICIA provides that the Bank cannot pay a dividend if it will cause the Bank to be “undercapitalized.”  
     Examinations. The FRB and the Colorado Division of Banking periodically examine and evaluate banks. Based upon such an evaluation, the examining regulator may revalue the assets of an insured institution and require that it establish specific reserves to compensate for the difference between the value determined by the regulator and the book value of such assets.
     Restrictions on Loans to One Borrower. Under state law, the aggregate amount of loans that may be made to one borrower by the Bank is generally limited to 15% of its unimpaired capital, surplus, undivided profits and allowance for loan losses. The Bank has set an internal lending limit that is more stringent than the regulatory requirement.  The Bank seeks participations to accommodate borrowers whose financing needs exceed the Bank’s lending limits.
     Brokered Deposits. Well-capitalized institutions are not subject to limitations on brokered deposits, while an adequately capitalized institution is able to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC and subject to certain restrictions on the yield paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions are generally not permitted to accept brokered deposits. 
     Real Estate Lending Evaluations. Federal regulators have adopted uniform standards for the evaluation of loans secured by real estate or made to finance improvements to real estate. The Bank is required to establish and maintain written internal real estate lending policies consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The Company has established loan-to-value ratio limitations on real estate loans that are more stringent than the loan-to-value limitations established by regulatory guidelines.
     Deposit Insurance Premiums. Under current regulations, FDIC-insured depository institutions that are members of the FDIC pay insurance premiums at rates based on their assessment risk classification, which is determined, in part, based on the institution’s capital ratios and factors that the FDIC deems relevant to determine the risk of loss to the FDIC.  
     The assessment base is calculated on average daily consolidated assets less average monthly tangible equity, defined as Tier 1 Capital.  The FDIC has adopted a progressively lower assessment rate schedule based on the level of the reserve ratio (Deposit Insurance Fund divided by the total estimated insured deposits of the industry).  Assessment rates decline when the reserve ratio exceeds 1.15%, 2.0% and 2.5%.  In June 2016, the reserve ratio exceeded 1.15% which set the initial base assessment rate for an Established Small Instituion at 3 to 30 basis points depending on a deposit risk score.  The amount an institution is assessed is based upon statutory factors that includes the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance

fund and may be reviewed semi-annually. A change in our risk category would negatively impact our assessment rates. 
     Additionally, all institutions insured by the FDIC Bank Insurance Fund are assessed fees to cover the debt of the Financing Corporation, the successor of the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.  The assessment rate effective for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 0.135 basis points (0.54 basis points annually).  The assessment rate is adjusted quarterly.
     Federal Home Loan Bank Membership.  The Bank is a member of the FHLB.  Each member of the FHLB is required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock. The Board of Directors of the FHLB can increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements.  Any increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Board.  Because the extent of any obligation to increase our investment in the FHLB depends entirely upon the occurrence of future events, potential future payments to the FHLB are not determinable.
     Capital Adequacy at the Holding Company and Bank
     The Federal Reserve monitors, on a consolidated basis, the capital adequacy of financial or bank holding companies by using a combination of risk-based and leverage ratios. Failure to meet the capital guidelines may result in supervisory or enforcement actions by the Federal Reserve. Under the risk-based capital guidelines, different categories of assets, including certain off-balance sheet items, such as loan commitments and letters of credit, are assigned different risk weights, based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset. These risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a “risk-weighted” asset base. 
     On January 1, 2015, the Basel III regulatory capital rules (Regulation Q, Capital Adequacy of Bank Holding Companies) became effective for the Company. Basel III increased most of the required minimum regulatory capital ratios, introduced a new Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio and the concept of a CCB that became effective in 2016.  The CCB is designed to establish a capital range above minimum requirements to insulate banks from periods of stress and impose constraints on dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonus payments when capital levels fall below prescribed levels. The minimum CCB in 2017 is 1.25% and increases 0.625% annually through 2019 to 2.5%.  Basel III required certain regulatory capital deductions to be phased in over a period of time, with full implementation beginning in 2018.  On November 21, 2017, the Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final rule to extend the regulatory capital transition applicable during 2017 to future periods for banking organizations such as the Company that are not subject to the advanced approaches capital rule.  This will reduce the capital impact to the Company in 2018 from the fully phased-in implementation of Basel III that was originally required.
     For purposes of the Basel III risk-based capital guidelines, total capital is defined as the sum of “Common Equity Tier 1,” “Additional Tier 1” (Common Equity Tier 1 combined with Additional Tier 1 gives total Tier 1 Capital) and “Tier 2” capital elements. Common Equity Tier 1 capital includes common shareholders’ equity reduced by certain regulatory deductions.  Additional Tier 1 capital includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and other capital instruments allowed by the institutions primary regulator (for the Company, this includes the previously issued junior subordinated debentures) and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, reduced by certain limitations and regulatory deductions. Tier 2 capital includes, with certain limitations, perpetual preferred stock, certain capital instruments not included in Additional Tier 1 and the allowance for loan losses (limited to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets). The regulatory guidelines require a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8% (of which at least 4.5% must be in the form of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and 6.0% in Tier 1 capital). The Federal Reserve has also implemented a leverage ratio, which is defined to be a company’s Tier 1 capital divided by its average total consolidated assets.

 Pursuant to the FDICIA, there are five capital levels specific to depository institutions that apply to the Bank, that are dependent on the relevant capital ratios and other factors: 
    
 | Total | Tier 1 | Common equity | Tier 1 
Prompt corrective | risk-based | risk-based | tier 1 | leverage
action category | capital | capital | risk-based capital | ratio 
Well capitalized | 10.0% | 8.0% | 6.5% | 5.0% 
Adequately capitalized | 8.0% | 6.0% | 4.5% | 4.0% 
Undercapitalized | < 8.0% | < 6.0% | < 4.5% | < 4.0% 
Significantly undercapitalized | < 6.0% | < 4.0% | < 3.0% | < 3.0% 
Critically undercapitalized | Tangible equity / Total assets < 2.0%

      Increasingly severe restrictions are placed on a depository institution as its capital level classification declines.  Banks with capital ratios below the required minimum are subject to certain administrative actions, including the termination of deposit insurance and the appointment of a receiver, and may also be subject to significant operating restrictions pursuant to regulations promulgated under the FDICIA.  
     In addition to the ratios in the table above, an institution is only well-capitalized if it is not subject to an order, written agreement, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Under these regulations, at December 31, 2017, the Bank was well-capitalized, which places no significant restrictions on the Bank’s activities.  See Note 17 – Regulatory Matters for additional information on the Company’s and the Bank’s capital ratios.
     Fee-Based Lines
     CoBiz Wealth is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, recordkeeping requirements, operational requirements and disclosure obligations. Many aspects of CoBiz Wealth’s business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict CoBiz Wealth from carrying on its investment management business in the event that they fail to comply with such laws and regulations. In such event, the possible sanctions which may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, business limitations on engaging in the investment management business for specified periods of time, the revocation of any such company’s registration as an investment adviser, and other censures or fines.
     CoBiz Insurance, acting as an insurance producer, must obtain and keep in force an insurance producer’s license with the State of Arizona and Colorado. In order to write insurance in other states, they are required to obtain non-resident insurance licenses. All premiums belonging to insurance carriers and all unearned premiums belonging to customers received by the agency must be treated in a fiduciary capacity. 
     Changing Regulatory Structure
     Regulation of the activities of national and state banks and their holding companies imposes a heavy burden on the banking industry. The Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC (national charters only) and State banking divisions all have extensive authority to police unsafe or unsound practices and violations of applicable laws and regulations by depository institutions and their holding companies. These agencies can assess civil monetary penalties, issue cease and desist or removal orders, seek injunctions, and publicly disclose such actions. 
     The laws and regulations affecting banks and financial or bank holding companies have changed significantly in recent years, and there is reason to expect changes will continue in the future, although it is difficult to predict the outcome of these changes. From time to time, various bills are introduced in the United States Congress with respect to the regulation of financial institutions. Certain of these proposals, if adopted, could significantly change the regulation of banks and the financial services industry.

 Monetary Policy
     The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has a significant effect on the operating results of financial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. Federal Reserve monetary policies have materially affected the operations of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the business and earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted.
