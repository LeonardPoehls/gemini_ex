ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Panera Bread Company and its subsidiaries, referred to as “Panera Bread,” “Panera,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” is a national bakery-cafe concept with 2,036 Company-owned and franchise-operated bakery-cafe locations in 46 states, the District of Columbia, and Ontario, Canada. We have grown from serving approximately 60 customers per day at our first bakery-cafe to currently serving approximately 9 million customers per week system-wide. We are currently one of the largest food service companies in the United States. We believe our success is based on our ability to create long-term concept differentiation. We operate under the Panera Bread®, Saint Louis Bread Co.®, and Paradise Bakery & Café® trademark names.
Our bakery-cafes are in a variety of locations including, urban, suburban, shopping centers, college campuses, and hospitals. We feature high-quality food in a warm, inviting, and comfortable environment. With our identity rooted in handcrafted artisan bread, we bake fresh bread every day. We are committed to providing great tasting, quality food that people can trust. In 2014, we formalized our Food Policy, an articulation of Panera's long held values, which expresses a commitment to clean ingredients and products by removing items identified on our “No No List”, transparency, and a positive impact on the food system. Our bakery-cafes have a menu highlighted by flavorful, wholesome offerings, including select proteins raised without antibiotics, grass-fed beef, whole grain bread, and select organic ingredients, with zero grams of artificial trans fat per serving. As of the beginning of 2017, our food menu met the requirements of our Food Policy and is “clean,” meaning that all of our products contain no artificial preservatives, no artificial sweeteners, no artificial flavors and no colors from artificial sources.
We strive to create new standards in everyday food choices, and our menu includes a wide variety of year-round favorites complemented by new items introduced seasonally. In neighborhoods across the United States and in Ontario, Canada, our customers are drawn to our warm and welcoming environment, which features comfortable gathering areas, relaxing decor, and free Internet access. Our bakery-cafes routinely donate bread and baked goods to community organizations in need.
We operate as three business segments: Company bakery-cafe operations, franchise operations, and fresh dough and other product operations. As of December 27, 2016, our Company bakery-cafe operations segment consisted of 902 Company-owned bakery-cafes and our franchise operations segment consisted of 1,134 franchise-operated bakery-cafes, located throughout the United States and in Ontario, Canada. As of December 27, 2016, our fresh dough and other product operations segment, which supplies fresh dough and other products daily to most Company-owned and franchise-operated bakery-cafes, consisted of 24 fresh dough facilities (22 Company-owned and two franchise-operated), located throughout the United States and one in Ontario, Canada. In the fiscal year ended December 27, 2016, or fiscal 2016, our revenues were $2,795 million, consisting of $2,434 million of Company-owned net bakery-cafe sales, $155 million of franchise royalties and fees, and $206 million of fresh dough and other product sales to franchisees. Franchise-operated net bakery-cafe sales, as reported by franchisees, were $2,744 million in fiscal 2016. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further segment information.

Our fiscal year ends on the last Tuesday in December. Each of our fiscal years ended December 27, 2016, December 29, 2015, or fiscal 2015, and December 30, 2014, or fiscal 2014, had 52 weeks. 
Concept and Strategy
Thirty years ago, at a time when quick service often meant low quality, Panera set out to challenge this expectation. We believed that food that was good and that you could feel good about, served in a warm and welcoming environment by people who cared, could bring out the best in all of us. To us, that is food as it should be and that is why we exist.

So we began with a simple commitment: to bake fresh bread every day in our bakery-cafes. No short cuts, just bakers with simple ingredients and hot ovens. Each night, any unsold bread and baked goods were shared with neighbors in need. 
These traditions carry on today, as we have continued to find ways to be an ally for the wellness of our guests. That means crafting a menu of soups, salads and sandwiches that we are proud to feed our families. Like poultry and pork raised without antibiotics on our salads and sandwiches. A commitment to transparency and options that empower our guests to eat the way they want. Seasonal flavors and whole grains. And our commitment to serve clean food by removing artificial flavors, sweeteners, preservatives, and colors from artificial sources from our food in all of our bakery-cafes in the United States.
We’re also focused on improving quality and convenience. With investments in technology and operations, we now offer new ways to enjoy your Panera favorites - including mobile ordering, Rapid Pick-Up for to-go orders, delivery and consumer packaged goods available at various grocers throughout the country - all designed to make things easier for our guests.
We believe our competitive strengths include more than just great food and superior customer service. We are committed to creating an ambiance in our bakery-cafes and a culture within Panera that is warm, inviting, and embracing, and focus our investments on elevating this experience. We design each bakery-cafe to provide a distinctive environment, in many cases using fixtures and materials complementary to the neighborhood location of the bakery-cafe as a way to engage customers. The distinctive design and environment of our bakery-cafes are intended to offer an oasis from the rush of daily life, where our associates are trained to greet our customers by name and have the skills, expertise, and personalities to make each visit a delight. Many of our bakery-cafes incorporate the warmth of a fireplace and cozy seating areas or outdoor cafe seating, which facilitate the use of our bakery-cafes as a gathering spot. Our bakery-cafes are designed to visually reinforce the distinctive difference between our bakery-cafes and other bakery-cafes and restaurants. In addition, we believe that our MyPanera® loyalty program allows us to build deeper relationships with our customers and entice them to return to our bakery-cafes. 
Our menu, operating systems, design, and real estate strategy allow us to compete successfully in several segments of the restaurant business: breakfast, lunch, gathering place, dinner, and take home, through both on-premise sales and off-premise Panera® Catering. We compete with specialty food, casual dining, and quick-service restaurant retailers, including national, regional, and locally-owned restaurants. Our competitors vary across different dayparts. We understand people choose restaurants depending on individual food preferences, mood, and price. Our goal is to be the place worth crossing the street for to enjoy Panera food. Because of that goal, we are working to drive increased customer desire through Concept Essence, our blueprint for attracting and retaining our customers that we believe differentiates us from our competitors, which includes innovations in food, marketing, and store design.
In addition to our in-bakery-cafe dining experience, we offer Panera Catering, a nation-wide catering service that provides breakfast assortments, sandwiches, salads, soups, pasta dishes, drinks, and bakery items using the same high-quality, fresh ingredients enjoyed in our bakery-cafes. Panera Catering is supported by a national sales infrastructure that includes an on-line ordering system. To support our bakery-cafes in servicing small-, medium- and large-order catering markets, we operate catering-only units, referred to as delivery hubs. As of December 27, 2016, there were 27 Company-owned and one franchise-operated delivery hubs.
Menu
Our menu is designed to provide a variety of food products our customers crave, along with transparency to empower them to choose how they want to eat. Panera was the first national restaurant company to voluntarily add calories to its menu boards in 2010 and currently includes this information on menu boards at all of our bakery-cafes. We feature a menu which includes proprietary items prepared with high-quality, fresh ingredients, including our fresh-from-the-field romaine lettuce and tomatoes and our chicken raised without antibiotics, as well as unique recipes and toppings designed to provide appealing, flavorful products. Our menu embodies a comprehensive set of commitments formally articulated in our Food Policy and consistent with our long held values. The Food Policy outlines our advocacy for a commitment to clean ingredients and a positive impact on the food system. In fiscal 2016, we announced our Kids Meal Promise, which expresses our commitment to offer kids meals that are clean, 
 2

worthy of trust, full of delicious options, nutritionally paired, and served with water, organic milk or juice, rather than a sugary beverage. At the beginning of 2017, we completed the removal of all artificial additives on our “No No List”.
Our key menu groups are daily baked goods, including a variety of freshly baked bagels, breads, muffins, scones, rolls, and sweet goods; made-to-order sandwiches and flatbreads; hearty, unique soups; freshly prepared and hand-tossed salads; pasta dishes; and custom roasted coffees and cafe beverages, such as hot or cold espresso and cappuccino drinks, smoothies, and hand-crafted non-carbonated beverages. We regularly review and innovate our menu offerings to feature new taste profiles we believe our customers crave.
Strategic Initiatives 
We are concentrating efforts and resources on a broad set of initiatives designed to make Panera a better competitive alternative and to enable expanded growth through not only Panera 2.0, a strategic initiative intended to enhance the experience for both our dine-in and to-go guests, but also through innovation in operations, food, and marketing, utilization of delivery hubs, expanded small-order delivery and our investments in technology to create the capabilities needed to support these initiatives. 
Specifically, our strategic Panera 2.0 and delivery initiatives are designed to enhance the experience for both our dine-in guests as well as those eating off premises. This enhanced guest experience is enabled by technology and operational improvements designed to keep up with high transaction volumes and to deliver unrestrained production demand. As of December 27, 2016, we were constructively complete with the roll-out of Panera 2.0 to Company-owned bakery-cafes.
As of December 27, 2016, approximately 15 percent of system-wide bakery-cafes offered delivery. We believe an integrated approach to delivery, rooted in our fast casual paradigm, will enable us to fulfill a significant unmet need for an elevated delivery experience with high-quality food, ultimately enhancing the experience of our customers eating off premises. 
Operational Excellence
We believe that operational excellence is the most important element of Panera Warmth, a concept that reflects the totality of the experience that our customers receive and can take home to share with friends and family, and without strong execution and operational skills, it is difficult to build and maintain a long-lasting relationship with our customers. To develop a strong connection with our customers, our bakery-cafes are staffed by skilled and engaging associates. Additionally, we believe high-quality restaurant management is critical to our long-term success and, as such, we provide detailed operations manuals and hands-on training to each of our associates. We train our associates both in small group and individual settings. Our systems have been created to educate our associates so each one is well prepared to respond to a customer’s questions and create a better dining experience. Furthermore, we believe our commitment to investing in staffing levels necessary to service growth in revenues, along with maintaining competitive compensation for our associates, is fundamental to our future success. 
We believe in providing bakery-cafe operators the opportunity to share in the success of the bakery-cafe. Through our Joint Venture Program, selected general managers and multi-unit managers may participate in a bonus program, which is based upon a percentage of the store profit of the bakery-cafes they operate, generally over a period of five years (subject to annual minimums and maximums). We believe the program’s multi-year approach improves operator quality and management retention, and creates team stability, which generally results in a higher level of consistency and customer service for a particular bakery-cafe. It also leads to stronger associate engagement and customer loyalty. Currently, approximately 46 percent of our Company-owned bakery-cafe operators participate in the Joint Venture Program. We believe this program is a fundamental underpinning of our low rate of management turnover and operational improvements.
Management Information Systems
We believe technology is a differentiator in the restaurant business. We are committed to being a leader in technology that makes a difference to our customers by providing a greater degree of access and convenience. As a result, we have concentrated efforts and resources on our Panera 2.0 initiative. The enhanced guest experience is enabled by technology, including the convenience of digital ordering and Rapid Pick-Up, and operational improvements. As of December 27, 2016, approximately 70 percent of our Company-owned bakery-cafes have transitioned to Panera 2.0. As a result of the Panera 2.0 transitions, as of December 27, 2016, digital utilization was approximately 24 percent in Company-owned bakery-cafes.
We expect to continue to make substantial investments in technology designed to provide greater access for customers, increased operational capabilities including improved labor and inventory management tools, and improvements in core enterprise systems. We also continue to modernize and make investments in our information technology networks and infrastructure, specifically in our physical and technological security measures to anticipate cyber-attacks and prevent breaches, and to provide improved control,

security and scalability. Enhancing the security of our financial data, customer information and other personal information remains a priority for us.
Each of our Company-owned bakery-cafes have programmed point-of-sale registers which collect transaction data used to generate pertinent information, including, among other things, transaction counts, product mix, and average check. All Company-owned bakery-cafe product prices are programmed into the point-of-sale registers from our support centers. We allow franchisees access to certain of our proprietary bakery-cafe systems and systems support. Franchisees are responsible for providing the appropriate menu prices, discount rates, and tax rates for system programming. 
We use in-store enterprise application tools to assist in labor scheduling and food cost management, to provide corporate and retail operations management with quick access to retail data, to allow on-line ordering with distributors, and to reduce managers’ administrative time. We also continue to invest in enhanced back-of-house forecasting and labor scheduling systems to improve the effectiveness of these capabilities. We use retail data to generate daily and weekly consolidated reports regarding sales and other key metrics, as well as detailed profit and loss statements for our Company-owned bakery-cafes. Additionally, we monitor the transaction counts, product mix, average check, and other sales trends. We also use this retail data in our “exception-based reporting” tools to safeguard our cash, protect our assets, and train our associates. Our fresh dough facilities have information systems which accept electronic orders from our bakery-cafes and monitor delivery of the ordered product back to our bakery-cafes. We also use proprietary on-line tools, such as eLearning, to provide on-line training for our retail and fresh dough facility associates and on-line baking instructions for our bakers. 
Marketing
We are committed to improving the customer experience in ways we believe few in our industry have done. We use our scale to execute a broader marketing strategy, not simply to build brand recognition and awareness, but also to build deeper relationships with our customers who we believe will help advocate for our brand.
To reach our target customer group, we advertise through a mix of mediums, including radio, billboards, social networking, and the Internet. In addition, we market through a national cable television campaign as a way to reach a broader audience. We believe our shift to a greater emphasis on national and digital advertising will help us improve and increase recognition of our brand and competitive differentiation. Our current advertising campaign, Panera Bread Food As It Should Be, speaks to our values and achievements, including our commitment to be an ally for the wellness of our guests.
Our MyPanera® customer loyalty program allows our customers to earn rewards based on registration in the program and purchases from our bakery-cafes. We believe MyPanera has allowed us to build deeper relationships with our customers by enhancing their experience with us through their receipt of rewards and enticing them to return to our bakery-cafes. Further, MyPanera offers us valuable insight into the preferences of our customers to help us further refine our marketing message and menu design. We believe MyPanera is the largest customer loyalty program in the industry, with approximately 25 million customers enrolled in MyPanera at the end of fiscal 2016. At the end of fiscal 2016, approximately 51 percent of our transactions in our bakery-cafes were attached to a MyPanera loyalty program card. 
Our franchise agreements generally require our franchisees to contribute to advertising expenses. In fiscal 2016, our franchise-operated bakery-cafes contributed 2.6 percent of their net sales to a national advertising fund, paid us a marketing administration fee of 0.4 percent of their net sales, and were required to spend 0.8 percent of their net sales on advertising in their respective markets. The national advertising fund and marketing administration contributions from our franchise-operated bakery-cafes are consolidated in our financial statements with amounts contributed by us. We contributed the same net sales percentages from Company-owned bakery-cafes towards the national advertising fund and marketing administration fee. 
Capital Resources and Deployment of Capital
We finance our activities through cash flow generated through operations and term loan borrowings. We also have the ability to borrow up to $250 million under a credit facility. Our capital requirements, including development costs related to the opening or acquisition of additional Company-owned bakery-cafes and fresh dough facilities, maintenance and remodel expenditures, and for other capital needs such as enhancements to information systems and other infrastructure to support ongoing operational initiatives have been and will continue to be significant. However, we believe that cash provided by our operations, our term loan borrowings, and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements for the foreseeable future.
We believe the best use of our capital is to invest in our core business, either through the development of new bakery-cafes or the enhancement of the guest experience in existing bakery-cafes.

In evaluating potential new bakery-cafe locations, we study the surrounding trade area and demographics and publicly available information on competitors. Based on this review and the use of proprietary, predictive modeling, we estimate projected sales and a targeted return on investment. We also employ a disciplined capital expenditure process in which we focus on occupancy and development costs in relation to the market. This process is designed to ensure we have an appropriate size bakery-cafe and deploy capital in the right market to generate desired returns.
Our concept has proved successful in different types of locations, such as in-line or end-cap locations in strip or power centers, regional malls, college campuses, hospitals, and free-standing units. The average Company-owned bakery-cafe size was approximately 4,500 square feet as of December 27, 2016. We lease nearly all of our bakery-cafe locations and all of our fresh dough facilities. The reasonably assured lease term for most bakery-cafe and support center leases is the initial non-cancelable lease term plus one renewal option period, which generally equates to an aggregate of 15 years. The reasonably assured lease term for most fresh dough facility leases is the initial non-cancelable lease term plus one to two renewal periods, which generally equates to an aggregate of 20 years. Lease terms generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, and other operating costs. Certain bakery-cafe leases provide for contingent rental (i.e., percentage rent) payments based on sales in excess of specified amounts. Certain of our lease agreements provide for scheduled rent increases during the lease term or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy.
The average construction, equipment, furniture and fixtures, and signage cost excluding capitalized development overhead for the 48 Company-owned bakery-cafes that opened in fiscal 2016 was approximately $1.3 million per bakery-cafe.
We also return cash to stockholders in the form of share repurchases under our publicly announced share repurchase authorizations. During fiscal 2016, we repurchased 1,815,432 shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $371.2 million. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased 2,201,719 shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $399.9 million. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased 941,878 shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $154.1 million. 
Franchise Operations
Our franchisees, which as of December 27, 2016 operated approximately 56 percent of our bakery-cafes, are comprised of 35 franchise groups with an average of approximately 32 bakery-cafes per group. We are selective in granting franchises, and applicants must meet specific criteria in order to gain consideration for a franchise. Generally, our franchisees must be well-capitalized to open bakery-cafes, meet a negotiated development schedule, and have a proven track record as a multi-unit restaurant operator. Additional qualifications include minimum net worth and liquidity requirements, infrastructure and resources to meet our development schedule, and a commitment to the development of our brand. If all of these qualifications are not met, we may still consider granting a franchise depending on the market and the particular circumstances.
As of December 27, 2016, we had 1,134 franchise-operated bakery-cafes operating throughout the United States and in Ontario, Canada, and we have received commitments to open 153 additional franchise-operated bakery-cafes. The timetables for opening these bakery-cafes are generally established in our Area Development Agreements, or ADAs, with franchisees, which provide for the majority of these planned bakery-cafes to open within the next five years. The ADAs require a franchisee to develop a specified number of bakery-cafes on or before specified dates. If a franchisee fails to develop bakery-cafes on schedule, we have the right to terminate the ADA and develop Company-owned locations or develop locations through new franchisees in that market. We may exercise one or more alternative remedies to address defaults by area developers, including not only development defaults, but also defaults in complying with our operating and brand standards and other covenants under the ADAs and franchise agreements. We may waive compliance with certain requirements under our ADAs and franchise agreements if we determine such action is warranted under the particular circumstances.
Pursuant to a typical ADA, we receive a franchise fee of $35,000 per bakery-cafe (of which we generally receive $5,000 at the signing of the ADA and $30,000 at or before the bakery-cafe opening) and continuing royalties, which are generally five percent of net sales per bakery-cafe. Franchise royalties and fees in fiscal 2016 were $155.3 million, or 5.6 percent of our total revenues. Our franchise-operated bakery-cafes follow the same protocol for in-store operating standards, product quality, menu, site selection, and bakery-cafe construction as Company-owned bakery-cafes. Generally, franchisees are required to purchase all of their fresh dough and other products from us or sources approved by us. Our fresh dough facility system supplies fresh dough and other products to substantially all franchise-operated bakery-cafes. We do not generally finance franchisee construction or ADA payments. From time to time and on a limited basis, we may provide certain development or real estate services to franchisees in exchange for a payment equal to the total costs of the services plus an additional fee. We also provide to our franchise-operated bakery-cafes, for a fee, limited information technology services and access to information technology infrastructure supporting operational initiatives. As of December 27, 2016, we did not hold an equity interest in any of our franchise-operated bakery-cafes.

Bakery-Cafe Supply Chain
We believe our fresh dough facility system and supply chain function provide us with a competitive advantage. We have a unique supply-chain operation in which our regional fresh dough facilities supply dough for our fresh bread on a daily basis, along with tuna, cream cheese, and certain produce to substantially all of our Company-owned and franchise-operated bakery-cafes. As of December 27, 2016, we had 24 fresh dough facilities, 22 of which were Company-owned, including one located in Ontario, Canada, to support the 19 bakery-cafes located within that market.
Fresh dough is the key to our high-quality, artisan bread, and fresh produce is essential to our high-quality salads and sandwiches. We distribute fresh dough and produce through a leased fleet of temperature controlled trucks operated by our associates. As of December 27, 2016, we leased 268 trucks. The optimal maximum distribution range is approximately 300 miles; however, when necessary, the distribution ranges may be up to 500 miles. 
Our bakers bake through the night to bring our customers fresh-baked loaves, bagels, and sweet goods every morning. In addition, our bakers bake high volume products throughout the day to continue to deliver abundant amounts of the highest quality and freshest bread possible. We believe our fresh dough facilities have helped us and will continue to help us to maintain consistent food quality at our bakery-cafes.
We focus our growth in areas we believe allow us to continue to gain efficiencies through leveraging the fixed cost of the fresh dough facility structure. There are opportunities we may not be able to currently address with our traditional fresh dough facility structure. As a result, we may be required to construct additional fresh dough facilities or utilize alternative manufacturing and distribution processes consistent with our quality standards to address these needs.
Our supply chain management system is intended to provide bakery-cafes with high-quality food from reliable sources. We are committed to having a positive impact on the food system by sourcing responsibly raised livestock and poultry, as well as high-quality ingredients without artificial flavors, sweeteners, preservatives or colors from artificial sources, including those identified on our No No List. 
We contract externally for the manufacture of the remaining baked goods in the bakery-cafes, referred to as sweet goods. Sweet goods products are completed at each bakery-cafe by our professionally trained bakers. Completion includes finishing with fresh toppings and other ingredients and baking to established artisan standards utilizing unique recipes.
We use independent distributors to distribute our proprietary sweet goods products and other materials to bakery-cafes. With the exception of products supplied directly by the fresh dough facilities, virtually all other food products and supplies for our bakery-cafes, including paper goods, coffee, and smallwares, are contracted by us and delivered by vendors to an independent distributor for delivery to the bakery-cafes. We maintain a list of approved suppliers and distributors from which we and our franchisees must select. We leverage our size and scale to improve the quality of our ingredients, improve purchasing efficiency, and negotiate purchase agreements, which includes purchasing commodities under agreements with terms generally ranging from one month to one year, usually at a fixed price, with most of our approved suppliers to achieve cost reduction for both us and our customers. 
Food quality and safety has been and will continue to be a priority for us. We have rigorous processes in place and follow industry standard practices for quality and safety. We monitor evolving best practices in food safety and work with our vendors to implement them. We believe these processes help to ensure we serve safe, wholesome food at our bakery-cafes.
Competition
We compete with a variety of national, regional and locally-owned food service companies, including specialty food, casual dining and quick-service restaurants, bakeries, and restaurant retailers. Our bakery-cafes compete in several segments of the restaurant business: breakfast, lunch, gathering place, dinner, take home, catering, delivery, and consumer packaged goods. We believe we are able to compete favorably against other food service providers through our convenient bakery-cafe locations, appealing environment, high-quality food, beverages, customer service, and marketing. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial resources than we do. For further information regarding competition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Employees
As of December 27, 2016, we had approximately 50,800 total associates of whom approximately 21,000 work, on average, at least 25 hours per week. Approximately 47,600 associates were employed in our bakery-cafe operations as bakers, managers, and associates, approximately 1,600 were employed in our fresh dough facility operations, and approximately 1,600 were employed in general or administrative functions, principally in our support centers. We do not have any collective bargaining agreements with our associates and we consider our employee relations to be good. We place a priority on staffing our bakery-cafes, fresh 
 6

dough facilities, and support center operations with skilled associates and invest in training programs to maintain the quality of our operations.
Proprietary Rights
Our brand, intellectual property, and our confidential and proprietary information are very important to our business and competitive position. We protect these assets through a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret, unfair competition, and contract laws.
