ITEM | 1. BUSINESS
-----+------------

 General
Praxair, Inc. (Praxair or the company) was founded in 1907 and became an independent publicly traded company in 1992. Praxair was the first company in the United States to produce oxygen from air using a cryogenic process and continues to be a technological innovator in the industrial gases industry. 
 Praxair is a leading industrial gas company in North and South America and one of the largest worldwide. Praxairs primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). The company also designs, engineers, and builds equipment that produces industrial gases primarily for internal use. The companys surface technologies segment, operated through Praxair Surface Technologies, Inc., supplies wear-resistant and high-temperature corrosion-resistant metallic and ceramic coatings and powders. Praxairs sales were $11,437 million, $10,534 million, and $10,776 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Refer to Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis, for a discussion of consolidated sales and Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Praxairs reportable segments. 
 Praxair serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, petroleum refining, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals and water treatment. In 2017, 95% of sales were generated in four geographic segments (North America, Europe, South America and Asia) primarily from the sale of industrial gases, with the balance generated from the surface technologies segment. Praxair provides a competitive advantage to its customers by continuously developing new products and applications, which allow them to improve their productivity, energy efficiency and environmental performance. 
 Proposed Business Combination with Linde AG 
 On June 1, 2017, Praxair and Linde AG entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement, as amended (the Business Combination Agreement), pursuant to which, among other things, Praxair and Linde AG agreed to combine their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction, and become subsidiaries of a new holding company incorporated in Ireland, Linde plc. Pursuant to the business combination agreement, Lindes business will be brought under Linde plc through Linde plcs offer to exchange Linde AG shares for Linde plc shares and Praxairs business will be brought under Linde plc through a merger of an indirect wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary of Linde plc with and into Praxair, with Praxair surviving the merger. Praxairs stockholders approved the merger at Praxairs special meeting held on September 27, 2017, and on November 24, 2017, the tender period for the exchange offer expired with approximately 92% of all Linde AG shares entitled to voting rights being tendered. 
 Completion of the Business Combination remains subject to approval by requisite governmental regulators and authorities, including approvals under applicable competition laws. The parties currently expect the Business Combination to be completed in the second half of 2018. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 Industrial Gases Products and Manufacturing Processes 
 Atmospheric gases are the highest volume products produced by Praxair. Using air as its raw material, Praxair produces oxygen, nitrogen and argon through several air separation processes of which cryogenic air separation is the most prevalent. Rare gases, such as krypton, neon and xenon, are also produced through cryogenic air separation. As a pioneer in the industrial gases industry, Praxair is a leader in developing a wide range of proprietary and patented applications and supply systems technology. Praxair also led the development and commercialization of non-cryogenic air separation technologies for the production of industrial gases. These technologies open important new markets and optimize production capacity for the company by lowering the cost of supplying industrial gases. These technologies include proprietary vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) and membrane separation to produce gaseous oxygen and nitrogen, respectively. 
 Process gases, including carbon dioxide, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, helium, specialty gases and acetylene are produced by methods other than air separation. Most carbon dioxide is purchased from by-product sources, including

 chemical plants, refineries and industrial processes or is recovered from carbon dioxide wells. Carbon dioxide is processed in Praxairs plants to produce commercial and food-grade carbon dioxide. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be produced by either steam methane reforming or auto-thermal reforming of natural gas or other feed streams such as naphtha. Hydrogen is also produced by purifying by-product sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries. Most of the helium sold by Praxair is sourced from certain helium-rich natural gas streams in the United States, with additional supplies being acquired from outside the United States. Acetylene is primarily sourced as a chemical by-product, but may also be produced from calcium carbide and water. 
 Industrial Gases Distribution 
 There are three basic distribution methods for industrial gases: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. These distribution methods are often integrated, with products from all three supply modes coming from the same plant. The method of supply is generally determined by the lowest cost means of meeting the customers needs, depending upon factors such as volume requirements, purity, pattern of usage, and the form in which the product is used (as a gas or as a cryogenic liquid). 
 On-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product (typically oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen) and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. Praxair constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and containing minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Advanced air separation processes allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements. Customers using these systems usually enter into requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 5-15 years. 
 Merchant. The merchant business is generally associated with distributable liquid oxygen, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and helium. The deliveries generally are made from Praxairs plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customers site which are owned and maintained by Praxair and leased to the customer. Due to distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances. The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three-to seven-year requirement contracts. 
 Packaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in metal containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Packaged gases include atmospheric gases, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, acetylene and related products. Praxair also produces and distributes in cylinders a wide range of specialty gases and mixtures. Cylinders may be delivered to the customers site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and through purchase orders. 
 A substantial amount of the cylinder gases sold in the United States is distributed by independent distributors that buy merchant gases in liquid form and repackage the products in their facilities. Packaged gas distributors, including Praxair, also distribute hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Over time, Praxair has acquired a number of independent industrial gases and welding products distributors at various locations in the United States and continues to sell merchant gases to other independent distributors. Between its own distribution business, joint ventures and sales to independent distributors, Praxair is represented in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 
 Surface Technologies 
 Praxair Surface Technologies is a leading worldwide supplier of coating services and thermal spray consumables to customers in the aircraft, energy, printing, primary metals, petrochemical, textile, and other industries. Its coatings are used to provide wear resistance, corrosion protection, thermal insulation, and many other surface-enhancing functions which serve to extend component life, enable optimal performance, and reduce operating costs. It also manufactures a complete line of electric arc, plasma and wire spray, and high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) equipment. 
 Inventories  Praxair carries inventories of merchant and cylinder gases, hardgoods and coatings materials to supply products to its customers on a reasonable delivery schedule. On-site plants and pipeline complexes have limited inventory. Inventory obsolescence is not material to Praxairs business.

Customers  Praxair is not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers. 
 International  Praxair is a global enterprise with approximately 57% of its 2017 sales outside of the United States. It conducts industrial gases business through consolidated companies in Argentina, Bahrain, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay. Societa Italiana Acetilene & Derivati S.p.A. (S.I.A.D.), an Italian company accounted for as an equity company, also has established positions in Austria, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine. Refrigeration and Oxygen Company Limited (ROC), a Middle Eastern company accounted for as an equity company, has operations in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar. Praxairs surface technologies segment has operations in Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and the United Kingdom. 
 Praxairs international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, import and export controls, and other economic, political and regulatory policies of local governments. Also, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Seasonality  Praxairs business is generally not subject to seasonal fluctuations to any significant extent. 
 Research and Development  Praxairs research and development is directed toward developing new and improved methods for the production and distribution of industrial gases and the development of new markets and applications for these gases. This results in the development of new advanced air separation and hydrogen process technologies and the frequent introduction of new industrial gas applications. Research and development for industrial gases is principally conducted at Tonawanda, New York and Burr Ridge, Illinois. 
 Praxair conducts research and development for its surface technologies to improve the quality and durability of coatings and the use of specialty powders for new applications and industries. Surface technologies research is conducted at Indianapolis, Indiana. 
 Patents and Trademarks  Praxair owns or licenses a large number of United States and foreign patents that relate to a wide variety of products and processes. Praxairs patents expire at various times over the next 20 years. While these patents and licenses are considered important to our individual businesses, Praxair does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any one particular patent, or patent license, or family of patents. Praxair also owns a large number of valuable trademarks. Only the Praxair trademark is important to our business as a whole. 
 Raw Materials and Energy Costs  Energy is the single largest cost item in the production and distribution of industrial gases. Most of Praxairs energy requirements are in the form of electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution. 
 The supply of energy has not been a significant issue in the geographic areas where the company conducts business. However, energy availability and price is unpredictable and may pose unforeseen future risks. 
 For carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, helium, hydrogen, specialty gases and surface technologies, raw materials are largely purchased from outside sources. Praxair has contracts or commitments for, or readily available sources of, most of these raw materials; however, their long-term availability and prices are subject to market conditions. 
 Competition  Praxair operates within a highly competitive environment. Some of its competitors are larger in size and capital base than Praxair. Competition is based on price, product quality, delivery, reliability, technology and service to customers. 
 Major competitors in the industrial gases industry both in the United States and worldwide include Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., LAir Liquide S.A., and Linde AG. Principal competitors for the surface technologies business are Chromalloy Gas Turbine LLC, a subsidiary of Sequa Corporation, Bodycote, PLC, and OC Oerlikon Corp AG. There are other industrial gas and surface coating competitors that compete on a local geography basis. 
 Employees and Labor Relations  As of December 31, 2017, Praxair had 26,461 employees worldwide. Of this number, 10,382 are employed in the United States. Praxair has collective bargaining agreements with unions at numerous locations throughout the world, which expire at various dates. Praxair considers relations with its employees to be good.
