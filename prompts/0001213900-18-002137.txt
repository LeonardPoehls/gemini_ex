Item 1. Description of Business.
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands as a business company with limited liability. This means that our shareholders have no additional liability for the company’s liabilities over and above the amount paid for their shares. We were formed for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation with, contractual control arrangement with, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.
Our Sponsor
 
Our sponsor, Bison Capital Holding Company Limited, founded in 2013, is an alternative investment company that invests in high growth opportunities in the media/entertainment, financial services and healthcare industries. Its investment strategy focus on identifying undervalued assets, bringing strategic resources and relationships to portfolio companies and generating new growth opportunities to realize appreciation under improved growth and valuation metrics.
Business Strategy
 
Our efforts in identifying prospective target businesses will not be limited to a particular industry or particular country, although we intend to focus on businesses that have their primary operations located in Asia and North America in media/entertainment, consumer services and healthcare industries. We believe that we will add value to these businesses primarily by providing them with access to the U.S. capital markets. In addition, we believe the target business will benefit from our involvement and increase growth through potential strategic relationships we can introduce.
 
We will seek to capitalize on the strength of our experienced, Asia-focused and North America-focused international management team. Our team consists of experienced financial services and accounting professionals, senior operating executives and directors of Asian and North American companies. Our Chairman, CEO, and directors have decades of experience in mergers, acquisitions and divestures of privately and publicly-held companies. Both our Chairman and CEO have been actively engaged in cross-border investments/divestments between the U.S. and Asia for more than a decade. Our independent directors are Canadian and U.S. citizens who have decades of experience in entrepreneurship, asset management/advisory services, and accounting & tax practices in Asia and the U.S. We believe we will benefit from their accomplishments in Asia as well as in the U.S., in identifying attractive acquisition opportunities. However, there is no assurance that we will complete a business combination.
 
There is no restriction in the geographic location of targets we can pursue, although we intend to initially prioritize geographic locations in Asia and North America. We will seek to identify targets that are likely to provide attractive financial returns through business combinations. We have yet to determine a time frame, an investment amount or any other criteria, which would trigger our search for business opportunities outside of Asia or North America.

Investment Criteria
 
Our management team intends to focus on creating shareholder value by leveraging its experience in the management, operation and financing of businesses to improve the efficiency of operations while implementing strategies to scale revenue organically and/or through acquisitions. We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines, which we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating prospective businesses, we may deviate from these criteria and guidelines should we see the justifications to do so.

● | Middle-Market Growth Business. We will primarily seek to acquire one or more growth businesses with a total enterprise value of between $150,000,000 and $200,000,000. We believe that there are a substantial number of potential target businesses within this valuation range that can benefit from new capital for scalable operations to yield significant revenue and earnings growth. We currently do not intend to acquire either a start-up company, defined as a company that has not yet established commercial operations, or a company with negative cash flow, though we may consider a business in its early stages of development or growth.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Companies in Business Segments that are Strategically Significant to Asia or North America. We will seek to acquire those businesses with strong technological know-how or advancement, sustainable market competitiveness, attractive growth prospects with meaning undervaluation, broad distribution networks and/or business practices in economic sectors that are currently experiencing significant Asia or North America outbound investing. Such sectors include but are not limited to: high technology, clean energy, healthcare, consumer and retail, energy and resources, food processing and manufacturing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Business with Revenue and Earnings Growth Potential. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of both existing and new product development, increased production capacity, expense reduction and synergistic follow-on acquisitions resulting in increased operating leverage.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Companies with Potential for Strong Free Cash Flow Generation. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential to generate strong, stable and increasing free cash flow. We intend to focus on one or more businesses that have predictable revenue streams and definable low working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We may also seek to prudently leverage this cash flow in order to enhance shareholder value.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Benefit from Being a Public Company. We intend to acquire a business or businesses that will benefit from being publicly traded and which can effectively utilize access to broader sources of capital and a public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
 
Our Competitive Advantages
 
We believe the experience and contacts of our management team will aid us in sourcing, structuring and consummating business combinations. However, none of our management team is obligated to remain with the company after a business combination, and we cannot provide assurance that the resignation or retention of our current management will be a term or condition in any agreement relating to a business combination. Moreover, despite the competitive advantages we believe we have, we remain subject to significant competition with respect to identifying and executing a business combination.

Our Relationship with Bison Capital Enhances Our Capabilities to Source, Execute, and Scrutinize Potential Acquisition Targets.
 
Our sponsor, Bison Capital, was founded in March 2013 and is an investment firm and a provider of financial, advisory, investment, and funds management services, primarily focused on China-related investment opportunities in the healthcare, medical, pharmaceuticals, entertainment, media, tourism, high technology industries. Bison Capital comprises advisory, capital raising, principal investing and asset management capabilities. It has a strong focus on China-related investment opportunities in the healthcare, medical, pharmaceuticals, entertainment, media, tourism and high technology industries. Bison Capital’s investment strategy is generating returns for investors and shareholders by bringing investment resources and strategic relationships to help clients generate new growth opportunities and secure key alliances. Bison Capital operates in office locations in mainland China and Hong Kong.
 
We believe that we could benefit from the substantial resources of Bison Capital. Bison Capital does not have a fiduciary duty to our shareholders, but has a contractual obligation to offer all suitable business combination opportunities to us before any other person or company until the consummation of our initial business combination, subject to any pre-existing contractual or fiduciary obligations it may have. Bison Capital will assist us in the identification, analysis, and diligence of potential targets if needed. Furthermore, our affiliation with Bison Capital could enable us to access potential targets for a business combination more effectively since Bison Capital is a well-recognized financial and investment company in the areas where we are planning to focus our acquisition efforts.
 
Bison Capital has deep specialist sector expertise and a comprehensive financial advisory and capital markets platform. Bison Capital’s expertise spans a variety of industry sectors including:
 

● | Industrials;

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Established Deal Sourcing Network
 
Through our management team, we believe we have contacts and sources from which to generate acquisition opportunities and possibly seek complimentary follow-on business arrangements. These contacts and sources include those in government, private and public companies around the world, private equity and venture capital funds, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants.

Unique positioning
 
We are a management team with significant experience in cross-border business between Asia and the U.S. We understand the cultural, business and economic differences and opportunities that will allow us to negotiate a transaction. For Asia-based companies, we provide the ability to help them bridge their overseas expansion in term of both capital raising and business activity. In addition, if we find a very attractive acquisition target outside of the Asia region, we believe our experience and relationships in Asia would enhance the value of such a business through our introductions to identified Asian business partners.
 
Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to prospective target businesses. As a public company, we will offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering. We believe that target businesses will favor this alternative, which we believe is less expensive, while offering greater certainty of execution than the traditional initial public offering. During an initial public offering, there are typically expenses incurred in marketing, which would be costlier than a business combination with us. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is approved by our shareholders and the transaction is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with shareholders’ interests than it would as a private company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented management staffs.
 
Strong Financial Position and Flexibility
 
As of December 31, 2017, the trust account had a balance of $62,208,330. With this trust account and a public market for our ordinary shares, we can offer a target business a variety of options to facilitate a business combination and fund future expansion and growth of its business. Because we are able to consummate a business combination using the cash proceeds from our initial public offering that closed on June 23, 2017, our share capital, debt or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use an efficient structure allowing us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to address the needs of the parties. However, if a business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay for the purchase price, we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination. Because we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing. Accordingly, our flexibility in structuring a business combination may be subject to these constraints.
Significant Activities since Inception
 
On June 23, 2017, we consummated the initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 5,250,000 units (the “Units”), at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $52,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 388,750 private units (the “Private Units”), to our sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EarlyBird”), and/or their designees, generating gross proceeds of $3,887,500 (the “Private Placement”). 
 
On June 28, 2017, the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering elected to fully exercise their over-allotment option to purchase 787,500 additional Units (the “Over-allotment Units”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $7,875,000. In addition, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, we consummated the sale of an additional 43,312 private units (the “Over-Allotment Private Units”) at approximately $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $433,125.

A total of $61,884,375 of the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement (including the sale of the Over-Allotment Units and the Over-Allotment Private Units) were deposited in the Trust Account.  We incurred costs in the aggregate amount of $2,250,189 related to Initial Public Offering including $1,811,250 of underwriting fees and $438,939 of other costs.
 
Our units began trading on June 20, 2017 on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “BCACU.” Commencing on July 17, 2017, the Ordinary Shares, rights and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols “PAAC,” “BCACR” and “BCACW,” respectively.
 
Effecting our initial business combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that has begun operations but is not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales), which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our ordinary shares, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
We have not identified any acquisition targets. Subject to the requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, we have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. Accordingly, there is no current basis for shareholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, this assessment may not result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or the Nasdaq Capital Market, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.

Sources of target businesses
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity groups, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources also may introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, also may bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. Although some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the acquired business following our initial business combination, the presence or absence of any such arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.
 
On November 16, 2017, we entered into a finder agreement (the “Finder Agreement”) with EarlyBird, the sole book-running manager and the leading underwriter in the Initial Public Offering. Pursuant to the Finder Agreement, EarlyBird will introduce potential targets (the “Targets”) to us on a nonexclusive basis in connection with a business combination. We shall pay to EarlyBird for its services, upon the closing (or closings) of a business combination with a Target, a cash fee equal to one percent (1.0%) of the Total Consideration (as defined below) deducting any finder fee, advisor fee or any other type of service fee or compensation that Target has paid or has agreed to pay to EarlyBird in connection with such business combination. We shall also reimburse EarlyBird for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred and such expenses shall not exceed $10,000 in the aggregate through the termination of the Finder Agreement unless otherwise consented to in writing by us in advance.
 
For the purposes of the Finder Agreement, “Total Consideration” shall mean the total value of all cash, securities, or other property paid or transferred at the closing (or closings) of a business combination by or to us, the Target and/or its respective shareholders or to be paid or transferred in the future to such parties with respect to such business combination (other than payments of interest or dividends), including, without limitation, any value paid in respect of (i) the assets of the Company or Target, (ii) the capital stock of the Company or Target (and any securities convertible into options, warrants or other rights to acquire such capital stock), and (iii) the assumption, retirement or defeasance, directly or indirectly (by operation of law or otherwise), of any long-term liabilities of the Company or Target or repayment of indebtedness, including, without limitation, indebtedness secured by the assets of the Company or Target, capital leases or preferred stock obligations. If Total Consideration paid or transferred in the transaction includes non-cash consideration consisting of common stock, options, warrants or rights for which either a public trading market existed or did not exist prior to consummation of the transaction, then the value of such securities shall be determined in accordance with the provisions under the Finder Agreement.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with such a company, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire that such an initial business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view.
 
Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination
 
Subject to the requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. In any case, we will only consummate an initial business combination in which we become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes as discussed below) or are otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act or to the extent permitted by law we may acquire interests in a variable interest entity, in which we may have less than a majority of the voting rights in such entity, but in which we are the primary beneficiary. There is no basis for shareholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that has begun operations but is not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales), we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us.

The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. We will not pay any finders or consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.
 
Fair market value of target business or businesses
 
The target business or businesses or assets with which we effect our initial business combination must have a collective fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. If we acquire less than 100% of one or more target businesses in our initial business combination, the aggregate fair market value of the portion or portions we acquire must equal at least 80% of the value of the trust account at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. However, we will always acquire at least a controlling interest in a target business. The fair market value of a portion of a target business or assets will likely be calculated by multiplying the fair market value of the entire business by the percentage of the target we acquire. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with an initial target business or businesses with a collective fair market value in excess of the balance in the trust account. In order to consummate such an initial business combination, we may issue a significant amount of debt, equity or other securities to the sellers of such business and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt, equity or other securities. If we issue securities in order to consummate such an initial business combination, our shareholders could end up owning a minority of the combined company’s voting securities as there is no requirement that our shareholders own a certain percentage of our company (or, depending on the structure of the initial business combination, an ultimate parent company that may be formed) after our business combination. Because we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such arrangement to issue our debt or equity securities and have no current intention of doing so.
 
The fair market value of a target business or businesses or assets will be determined by our board of directors based upon standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as actual and potential gross margins, the values of comparable businesses, earnings and cash flow, book value, enterprise value and, where appropriate, upon the advice of appraisers or other professional consultants. Investors will be relying on the business judgment of our board of directors, which will have significant discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of a particular target business. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine that the target business or assets has a sufficient fair market value to meet the threshold criterion, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire with respect to the satisfaction of such criterion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless we consummate a business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire, that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders.
 
Lack of business diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:
 

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited ability to evaluate the target’s management team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. The future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. Consequently, members of our management team may not become a part of the target’s management team, and the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Further, it is also not certain whether one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination. Moreover, members of our management team may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. Our key personnel may not remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
 
Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Shareholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination
 
Although we may seek shareholder approval before we effect our initial business combination, we may not do so for business or legal reasons (so long as such transaction does not require shareholder approval under the Companies Act or the Nasdaq Capital Market rules). Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether we expect shareholder approval would be required under the Companies Act for each such transaction.
 
Type of Transaction | Whether Shareholder Approval is Required
---------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target with a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 
Entering into contractual agreements with a target to obtain control | No 

 
We also may be required to obtain shareholder approval if we wish to take certain actions in connection with our initial business combination such as adopting an incentive stock or share plan or amending our memorandum and articles of association.

Redemption rights for public shareholders upon consummation of our initial business combination
 
We will provide our shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares upon the consummation of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. As of December 31, 2017, the amount in the trust account was $62,208,330. Our sponsor, other initial shareholders, officers, directors or affiliates have agreed to waive their right to receive liquidating distributions if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the requisite time period for their private units and founder shares. However, for all public shares our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquired in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period.
 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act and, as such, for so long as we remain a foreign private issuer, we are required to comply with the tender offer rules in connection with our initial business combination. We do not intend to conduct a shareholder vote in connection with our initial business combination unless required by Nasdaq rules or applicable laws for so long as we remain a foreign private issuer. We will provide our shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination by means of a tender offer as set forth in our memorandum and articles of incorporation and pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act. If we continue to be a foreign private issuer and we are required by Nasdaq rules or applicable laws to hold a shareholder vote, we will do so, but redemptions will still be effectuated pursuant to the tender offer rules described above. To the extent Nasdaq rules or applicable laws require redemption pursuant to a shareholder vote, even if we are also conducting a tender offer, we will comply with such rules or laws. We will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. If we conduct a tender offer, we will not be permitted to consummate our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. Our offer to redeem shall remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act.
 
Many blank check companies would not be able to consummate our initial business combination if the holders of the company’s public shares elected to redeem more than a specified maximum percentage of the shares sold in such company’s initial public offering, which percentage threshold has typically been between 19.99% and 39.99%. As a result, many blank check companies have been unable to complete business combinations because the amount of shares redeemed by their public shareholders electing redemption exceeded the maximum redemption threshold pursuant to which such company could proceed with our initial business combination. Because we have no such specified maximum redemption threshold, our structure is different in this respect from the structure that has been used by many blank check companies. However, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares and the related business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination.
 
In connection with the successful consummation of our business combination, we may redeem pursuant to a tender offer up to that number of ordinary shares that would permit us to maintain net tangible assets of $5,000,001. However, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our proposed initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or members of its management team, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the allocation of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination, or any combination thereof. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares that are validly tendered plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not consummate the business combination, we will not purchase any shares pursuant to the tender offer and all shares will be returned to the holders thereof following the expiration of the tender offer. Additionally, since we are required to maintain net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 (which may be substantially higher depending on the terms of our potential business combination), the chance that the holders of our ordinary shares electing to redeem in connection with a redemption conducted pursuant to the tender offer rules will cause us to fall below such minimum requirement is increased.

When we conduct a tender offer to redeem our public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination, in order to comply with the tender offer rules, the offer will be made to all of our shareholders, not just our public shareholders.
 
Our initial shareholders (and/or our sponsor’s designees) have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private shares and public shares in connection with any such tender offer.
 
If we are no longer deemed a foreign private issuer (and no longer required to comply with the foreign private issuer rules), we will conduct redemptions like other blank check companies in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules (i.e., a shareholder vote) or pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will conduct a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules or the tender offer rules and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon consummation of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek shareholder approval, we will consummate our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our sponsor, directors, officers and affiliates have agreed to vote their founder shares, any private shares purchased in the Private Placement, and any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial shareholders including our sponsor have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to its founder shares, private shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares and the related business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination.
 
Limitation on redemption rights upon consummation of our initial business combination if we seek shareholder approval
 
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that a public shareholder, individually or together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 20% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to consummate our initial business combination, particularly in connection with our initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. We will resolve any disputes relating to whether a public shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” either by requiring certifications under the penalty of perjury to such effect by public shareholders or via adjudication in court.

Permitted purchases of our securities by our affiliates
 
If we seek shareholder approval of our business combination, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. Such purchases will not be made if our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates are in possession of any material non-public information that has not been disclosed to the selling shareholder. Such a purchase would include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. Our initial shareholders, officers, directors and their affiliates could purchase sufficient shares so that the initial business combination may be approved without the majority vote of public shares held by non-affiliates. It is intended that, if Rule 10b-18 would apply to purchases by our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates, then such purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, to the extent it applies, which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions, including with respect to timing, pricing and volume of purchases.
 
The purpose of such purchases would be to (1) increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (2) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of the business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the consummation of an initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
As a consequence of any such purchases, the public “float” of our ordinary shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain the listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange following consummation of a business combination.
 
Tendering share certificates in connection with redemption rights
 
If we engage in tender offer or a proxy solicitation for a business combination, we will require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.

The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on our initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the shareholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery at or prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date of the shareholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
 
If the initial business combination is not approved (if we were to seek shareholder approval) or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to tender their shares or exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
 
If our initial proposed business combination is not consummated, we may continue to try to consummate our initial business combination with a different target until 21 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering.
 
Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination
 
Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed that we must complete our initial business combination within 21 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. We may not be able to find a suitable target business and consummate our initial business combination within such time period. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within 21 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter (subject to our memorandum and articles of association and the laws of the British Virgin Islands), distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), pro rata to our public shareholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs. This redemption of public shareholders from the trust account shall be effected as required by function of our memorandum and articles of association and prior to any voluntary winding up, although at all times subject to the Companies Act.
 
Following the redemption of public shares, we intend to enter “voluntary liquidation” which is the statutory process for formally closing and dissolving a company under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. Given that we intend to enter voluntary liquidation following the redemption of public shareholders from the trust account, we do not expect that the voluntary liquidation process will cause any delay to the payment of redemption proceeds from our trust account. In connection with such a voluntary liquidation, the liquidator would give notice to creditors inviting them to submit their claims for payment, by notifying known creditors (if any) who have not submitted claims and by placing a public advertisement in at least one newspaper published in the British Virgin Islands newspaper and in at least one newspaper circulating in the location where we have our principal place of business, and taking any other steps the liquidator considers appropriate to identify our creditors, after which our remaining assets would be distributed. As soon as our affairs are fully wound-up, the liquidator must complete his statement of account and make a notificational filing with the Registrar. We would be dissolved once the Registrar issues a Certificate of Dissolution.

Our initial shareholders (and/or our sponsor’s designees) have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and private units if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable period from the closing of the Initial Public Offering.
 
However, if our sponsor, or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distribution with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants or rights, which will expire worthless in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination within 21 months of the closing of the Initial Public Offering. We will pay the costs of our liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. However, the liquidator may determine that he or she requires additional time to evaluate creditors’ claims (particularly if there is uncertainty over the validity or extent of the claims of any creditors). Also, a creditor or shareholder may file a petition with the BVI court which, if successful, may result in our liquidation being subject to the supervision of that court. Such events might delay distribution of some or all of our remaining assets.
 
Additionally, in any liquidation proceedings under British Virgin Islands law, the funds held in our trust account may be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any such claims deplete the trust account we may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts payable to them.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would initially be $10.25. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors, which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. Furthermore, our underwriters may seek recourse against the proceeds in the trust account relating to any future claims they may have against us. The actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may therefore be less than $10.25, plus interest (net of any taxes payable).
 
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Pursuant to a letter agreement among us, EarlyBird, our sponsor, and each of our directors and officers, which was filed as an exhibit to the registration statement we filed in connection with our Initial Public Offering, in order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, Bison Capital, our sponsor, agreed that it will be liable to us, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below $10.25 per share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Bison Capital will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However, Bison Capital may not be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our other officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. We have not independently verified whether Bison Capital has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations. We believe the likelihood of Bison Capital having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account.

In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.25 per share and Bison Capital asserts that it is unable to satisfy any applicable obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against Bison Capital to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Bison Capital to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, due to claims of creditors, the actual value of the per-share redemption price may be less than $10.25 per share.
 
We will seek to reduce the possibility that Bison Capital will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Bison Capital will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to up to approximately $210,088 not placed in the trust account with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $20,000). As the date of this report, we have used $365,215 for general corporate purpose. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
 
If we are deemed insolvent for the purposes of the Insolvency Act (i.e., (i) we fail to comply with the requirements of a statutory demand that has not been set aside under Section 157 of the Insolvency Act; (ii) execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a British Virgin Islands court in favor of a creditor of ours is returned wholly or partly unsatisfied; or (iii) either the value of our liabilities exceeds its assets, or the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), then there are very limited circumstances where prior payments made to shareholders or other parties may be deemed to be a “voidable transaction” for the purposes of the Insolvency Act. A voidable transaction would include, for these purposes, a payment made as “unfair preferences” or a “transaction at an undervalue.” A liquidator appointed over an insolvent company who considers that a particular transaction or payment is a voidable transaction under the Insolvency Act could apply to a British Virgin Islands courts for an order setting aside that payment or transaction in whole or in part.
 
Additionally, if we enter insolvent liquidation under the Insolvency Act, the funds held in our trust account will likely be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the trust account you may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts due them.
 
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of a redemption of the public shares prior to any winding up in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination within 21 months of the closing of the Initial Public Offering, if they redeem their shares in connection with an initial business combination that we consummate, or if we seek to amend our memorandum and articles of association to affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem all public shares if we cannot complete an initial business combination within 21 months of the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In no other circumstances shall a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must also exercise its redemption rights described above.

Comparison of redemption or purchase prices in connection with our initial business combination and if we fail to consummate our initial business combination.
 
The following table compares the redemptions and other permitted purchases of public shares that may take place in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination and if we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within 21 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering.
 

 | Redemptions in Connection with our Initial Business Combination | Redemptions if we fail to Consummate our Initial Business Combination 
---------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Calculation of redemption price | Redemptions at the time of our initial business combination may be made pursuant to a tender offer or, if required by Nasdaq or applicable laws or if we lose our foreign private issuer status, in connection with a shareholder vote. The redemption price will be the same whether we conduct redemptions pursuant to a tender offer or in connection with a shareholder vote. In either case, our public shareholders may redeem their public shares for cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (which was $10.30 per share as of December 31, 2017), including interest less taxes payable and any additional amount released to us as permitted under the trust agreement, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitation that no redemptions will take place if all of the redemptions would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) agreed to in connection with the negotiation of terms of a proposed business combination. | If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within 21 months from the closing of this offering, we will redeem all public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (which was $10.30 per share as of December 31, 2017), including interest less taxes payable and less such net interest to pay dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares.
Impact to remaining shareholders | The redemptions in connection with our initial business combination will reduce the book value per share for our remaining shareholders, who will bear the burden of the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable. | The redemption of our public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination will reduce the book value per share for the shares held by our initial shareholders, including our sponsor, who will be our remaining shareholders after such redemptions.

Comparison of This Offering to Those of Blank Check Companies Subject to Rule 419
 
The following table compares the terms of this offering to the terms of an offering by a blank check company subject to the provisions of Rule 419. This comparison assumes that the gross proceeds, underwriting commissions and underwriting expenses of our offering would be identical to those of an offering undertaken by a company subject to Rule 419, and that the underwriters will not exercise their over-allotment option. None of the provisions of Rule 419 apply to our offering.

 | Terms of Our Offering | Terms Under a Rule 419 Offering 
----------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Receipt of interest on escrowed funds | Interest on proceeds from the trust account to be paid to shareholders is reduced by any taxes paid or payable. | Interest on funds in escrow account would be held for the sole benefit of investors, unless and only after the funds held in escrow were released to us in connection with our consummation of a business combination. 
Limitation on fair value or net assets of target business | Our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. | The fair value or net assets of a target business must represent at least 80% of the maximum offering proceeds. 
Exercise of the warrants | The warrants cannot be exercised until the consummation of a business combination and, accordingly, will be exercised only after the trust account has been terminated and distributed. | The warrants could be exercised prior to the completion of a business combination, but securities received and cash paid in connection with the exercise would be deposited in the escrow or trust account. 
Election to remain an investor | We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest less taxes payable, upon the consummation of our initial business combination, subject to the limitations described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) agreed to in connection with the negotiation of terms of a proposed business combination. As a foreign private issuer we are required to comply with the tender offer rules and for so long as we remain a foreign private issuer we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and our memorandum and articles of association and file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. As long as we remain a foreign private issuer and are required to comply with the tender offer rules, unless otherwise required by Nasdaq rules or applicable laws, we do not intend to conduct a shareholder vote. If we are a foreign private issuer and we are required by Nasdaq rules or applicable laws to hold a shareholder vote, we will do so, but redemptions will still be effectuated pursuant to the tender offer rules described above. To the extent Nasdaq rules or applicable laws require redemption pursuant to a shareholder vote, even if we are also conducting a tender offer, we will comply with such rules or laws. If we are no longer deemed a foreign private issuer (and no longer required to comply with the foreign private issuer rules), we will conduct the redemptions like other blank check companies in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules or pursuant to the tender offer rules. | A prospectus containing information pertaining to the business combination required by the SEC would be sent to each investor. Each investor would be given the opportunity to notify the company in writing, within a period of no less than 20 business days and no more than 45 business days from the effective date of a post-effective amendment to the company’s registration statement, to decide if he, she or it elects to remain a shareholder of the company or require the return of his, her or its investment. If the company has not received the notification by the end of the 45thbusiness day, funds and interest or dividends, if any, held in the trust or escrow account are automatically returned to the shareholder. Unless a sufficient number of investors elect to remain investors, all funds on deposit in the escrow account must be returned to all of the investors and none of the securities are issued.
 | If we lose our foreign private issuer status and we seek shareholder approval in connection with a business combination, each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In such case, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules or pursuant to the tender offer rules. | 
Business combination deadline | If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by 21 months from the closing of this offering, we will, as soon as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter (subject to our memorandum and articles of association and the laws of the British Virgin Islands), distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), pro rata to our public shareholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs, but always subject to the Companies Act. This redemption of public shareholders from the trust account shall be effected as required by function of our memorandum and articles of association and prior to any voluntary winding up. | If an acquisition has not been consummated within 18 months after the effective date of the company’s registration statement, funds held in the trust or escrow account are returned to investors.

Release of funds | Except for interest earned on the funds in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations, the proceeds held in the trust account will not be released until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination and the redemption of public shareholders upon failure to effect our initial business combination within the allotted time. | The proceeds held in the escrow account are not released until the earlier of the completion of a business combination and the failure to effect our initial business combination within the allotted time.

Comparison of This Offering to Those of Many Blank Check Companies Not Subject to Rule 419
 
The following table compares the terms of this offering to the terms of many blank check companies that are not subject to Rule 419. Each term of this offering described in the table below is located in our memorandum and articles of association.

 | Terms of Our Offering | Terms of Many Blank Check Offerings | Impact on Whether a Particular Business Combination is Completed 
-----------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirement to conduct a tender offer or hold a shareholder vote | We will provide our shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their ordinary shares upon the consummation of our initial business combination on the terms described in this prospectus. As a foreign private issuer we are required to conduct these redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules without filing a proxy statement with the SEC and without conducting a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination (unless Nasdaq rules or applicable laws require us to conduct a shareholder vote). Pursuant to our memorandum and articles of association and SEC rules, if we file tender offer documents with the SEC they will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. If we are no longer deemed to be a foreign private issuer we may instead seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination. In such case, we will conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies or pursuant to the tender offer rules, and file proxy materials with the SEC. | Many blank check companies are required to file a proxy statement with the SEC and hold a shareholder vote to approve their initial business combination regardless of whether such a vote is required by law. These blank check companies may not consummate their initial business combinations if the majority of the relevant companies’ public shares voted are voted against a proposed business combination. | Our ability to consummate our initial business combination without conducting a shareholder vote in the event that a shareholder vote is not required by law may increase the likelihood that we will be able to complete our initial business combination and decrease the ability of public shareholders to affect whether or not a particular business combination is completed.
Required shareholder vote if we hold a shareholder vote | If we are no longer deemed to be a foreign private issuer and we seek shareholder approval in conjunction with the consummation of our initial business combination, a majority of all shares voted that are entitled to vote are required to approve the business combination. | Many blank check companies require that majority of the public shares that are voted and entitled to vote approve the business combination. | Our ability to consummate our initial business combination by allowing all of our shareholders to vote in connection with our business combination will increase the likelihood that we will be able to complete our initial business combination.

Requirement to vote against a business combination in order to redeem | If we are no longer deemed to be a foreign private issuer and we seek shareholder approval in conjunction with the consummation of our initial business combination, each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. | Many blank check companies require public shareholders to vote against the proposed business combination in order to redeem their shares. | The ability of our public shareholders to vote in favor of a business combination and redeem their shares may increase the likelihood that we will be able to complete our initial business combination and decrease the ability of public shareholders to affect whether or not a particular business combination is completed. 
Limited Redemption Rights of 20% Public Shareholders | If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, individually or together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in this offering. | Many blank check companies limit the redemption rights of 10% – 20% public shareholders and limit the voting rights of such public shareholders. | We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms.
Redemption threshold | We do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold apart from the limitation that we will not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares and the related business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination. | Many blank check companies are not permitted to consummate our initial business combination if more than a specified percentage of the shares sold in such company’s initial public offering, which percentage threshold has typically been between 19.99% and 39.99%, elect to redeem or redeem their shares in connection with the shareholder vote. | The absence of a redemption threshold in our offering will make it easier for us to consummate our initial business combination even if a substantial majority of our shareholders do not agree.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Facilities
 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 609-610 21st Century Tower, No. 40 Liangmaqiao Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100016, China. The cost for this space is included in the $5,000 per month fee that we pay an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative services. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the metropolitan area that this amount is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
Our units, ordinary shares, rights and warrants are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements must be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or IFRS as recommended by the IASB and the historical financial statements must be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and consummate our initial business combination.
 
We will be required to evaluate and report on our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, although if our total annual gross revenues exceeds $1.07 billion, or our non-convertible debt issued within a three year period exceeds $1 billion, or if the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of our second fiscal quarter, we would cease to be an “emerging growth company” as of the following fiscal year.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such, and we and the members of our management team have not been subject to any such proceeding in the 12 months preceding the date of this Report.
