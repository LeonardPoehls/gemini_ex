ITEM 1.  Business
 
P&F is a Delaware corporation incorporated on April 19, 1963. For all periods presented until February 11, 2016 (the “Nationwide Closing Date”), the effective date of the sale of its Nationwide Industries, Inc. (“Nationwide”) subsidiary, P&F operated in two primary lines of business or segments: (i) tools and other products (“Tools”) and (ii) hardware and accessories (“Hardware”). As a result of the sale of Nationwide, which had been reported in the Hardware segment, the Company currently only operates in the Tools business. See Note 2 to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
 
Tools
 
The Company conducts its Tools business through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Continental Tool Group, Inc. (“Continental”), which in turn operates through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Florida Pneumatic Manufacturing Corporation (“Florida Pneumatic”) and Hy-Tech Machine, Inc. (“Hy-Tech”). Exhaust Technologies Inc. (“ETI”) and Universal Air Tool Company Limited (“UAT”) are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Florida Pneumatic. Effective April 5, 2017, Florida Pneumatic, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased substantially all of the operating assets, less certain payables of Jiffy Air Tool, Inc. (“Jiffy”). See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The business of Air Tool Service Company (“ATSCO”) operates through a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hy-Tech.
Florida Pneumatic
 
 Florida Pneumatic imports and sells pneumatic hand tools, most of which are of its own design, primarily to the retail, industrial, automotive and aerospace markets. This line of products includes sanders, grinders, drills, saws and impact wrenches. These tools are similar in appearance and function to electric hand tools, but are powered by compressed air, rather than by electricity or battery. Air tools, as they are more commonly referred to, generally are less expensive to operate, offer better performance and weigh less than their electrical counterparts. Florida Pneumatic imports approximately seventy-five types of pneumatic hand tools, most of which are sold at prices ranging from $50 to $1,000, under the names “Florida Pneumatic,” “Universal Tool,” AIRCAT, NITROCAT, as well as under the trade names or trademarks of several private label customers. These products are sold to retailers, distributors, and private label customers through in-house sales personnel and manufacturers’ representatives. The AIRCAT and NITROCAT brands of pneumatic tools are sold primarily to the automotive service and repair market (“automotive market”). Users of Florida Pneumatic’s hand tools include industrial maintenance and production staffs, do-it-yourself mechanics, professional automobile mechanics and auto body personnel. Jiffy manufactures and distributes pneumatic tools and components primarily to aerospace manufacturers. Lastly, Jiffy, a manufacturer and distributor of pneumatic tools and components acquired in April 2017, has enabled Florida Pneumatic to approach the aerospace sector with a much stronger brand.
 
Florida Pneumatic also markets, through its Berkley Tool division (“Berkley”), a product line that includes pipe and bolt dies, pipe taps, wrenches, vises and stands, pipe and tubing cutting equipment, hydrostatic test pumps, and replacement electrical components for a widely-used brand of pipe cutting and threading machines. Florida Pneumatic markets Berkley’s products through industrial distributors and contractors. Florida Pneumatic also assembles and markets a line of compressor air filters.
 
There are redundant supply sources for nearly all products purchased.
 
The primary competitive factors in the industrial and automotive pneumatic tool market are quality, breadth and availability of products, customer service, technical support, price and brand name awareness. The primary competitive factors in the retail pneumatic tool market are price, service and brand-name awareness. The primary competitive factors in Berkley’s business are price and service. Florida Pneumatic’s products are sold off the shelf. Currently, there is minimal seasonality to Florida Pneumatic’s revenue.
 
 During 2017 Florida Pneumatic purchased approximately 36% of its pneumatic tools from China, 63% from Taiwan and 1% from Japan and Europe.  Florida Pneumatic performs final assembly on certain of its products at its factory in Jupiter, Florida.
 
Hy-Tech
 
Hy-Tech designs, manufactures and distributes industrial pneumatic tools, industrial gears, hydrostatic test plugs and a wide variety of parts under the brands ATP ATSCO, OZAT, Numatx, Thaxton and Quality Gear.  Hy-Tech produces and sells over sixty types of pneumatic tools, which include heavy duty air tools, industrial grinders, impact sockets, hydro-pneumatic riveters, air motors and custom gears, with prices ranging from $450 to $42,000.
 
Its products are sold direct to major end-users, as well as through a broad network of industrial and fluid power distributors. Industries served include power generation, petrochemical, construction, railroad, mining, ship building and fabricated metals. Hy-Tech also manufactures components, assemblies, finished product and systems for various Original Equipment Manufacturers under their own brand names.
 
Other than a line of sockets sold under the “OZAT” brand name that are imported from Israel, and a small number of parts, all Hy-Tech products are manufactured in the United States of America.

Hy-Tech products are sold through its in-house sales force as well as manufacturer representatives. Further, its products are sold off the shelf and also are produced and sold to customer’s specifications.
 
The business is not seasonal but may be subject to periodic outage and maintenance schedules in refineries, power generation facilities and chemical plants. The primary competitive factors in their industrial markets are quality, value, breadth and availability of products, customer service and technical support.
 
Hy-Tech sources its raw materials from various well-established distributors throughout the United States. There are redundant sources for all materials.
 
Hardware
 
Nationwide
 
Prior to the Nationwide Closing Date, the Company conducted its Hardware business through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Countrywide Hardware, Inc. (“Countrywide”). Countrywide conducted its business operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Nationwide. As of the Nationwide Closing Date, Nationwide was an importer and manufacturer of door, window and fencing hardware and accessories, including rollers, hinges, window operators, sash locks, custom zinc castings and door closers. On the Nationwide Closing Date, Countrywide sold Nationwide to an unrelated third party for approximately $22.2 million.
 
In November 2016, Countrywide sold the land and building that was the sole location from which Nationwide operated for $3.5 million, after fees and expenses.

The Company elected not to renew an agreement with Sears, which terminated on September 30, 2017.Employees
 
The Company employed 171 full-time employees as of December 31, 2017. At various times during the year our operating units may employ seasonal or part-time help, as necessary. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a union.
