Item 1.                    Business.
General 

TIER REIT, Inc. is a publicly traded (NYSE: TIER), self-managed, Dallas-based real estate investment trust focused on owning quality, well-managed commercial office properties in dynamic markets throughout the U.S. As used herein, “TIER REIT,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to TIER REIT, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires. 
TIER REIT’s vision is to be the premier owner and operator of best-in-class office properties in TIER1 submarkets, which are primarily higher density and amenity-rich locations within select, high-growth metropolitan areas that offer a walkable experience to various amenities. TIER REIT was incorporated in June 2002 as a Maryland corporation and has elected to be treated, and currently qualifies, as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes.
As of December 31, 2017, we owned interests in 20 operating office properties, one non-operating property, and two development properties located in eight markets throughout the United States. Our corporate offices are located at 5950 Sherry Lane, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75225, and our telephone number is (972) 483-2400.    
Substantially all of our business is conducted through Tier Operating Partnership LP (“Tier OP”), a Texas limited partnership.  Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tier GP, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is the sole general partner of Tier OP.  Our direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tier Business Trust, a Maryland business trust, and Tier Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, are limited partners that together with Tier GP, Inc. own all of Tier OP.
Business Strategy
Our strategy is straightforward. Our vision is to be the premier owner and operator of best-in-class office properties in select submarkets within high-growth metropolitan areas. We focus on vibrant cities with local GDP and population growth above the national average and amenity-rich submarkets (“TIER1 submarkets”) that appeal to dynamic corporate users and highly educated, in-demand employees. Our mission is to provide unparalleled, TIER ONE Property Services to our tenants and outsized total return through stock price appreciation and dividend growth to our stockholders, although there can be no assurance of any such appreciation or growth.
Our investment efforts are concentrated on our seven target growth markets of Austin, Dallas, Houston, Charlotte, Nashville, Atlanta, and Denver.
2018 Key Objectives
Looking forward, we intend to grow in a prudent manner that reinforces our fundamental strategy of owning and operating best-in-class office properties within TIER1 submarkets in our seven target growth markets. Provided accommodative market conditions persist, we expect development to comprise a significant portion of our investment activity over the next several years. 

As we move into 2018, our business strategy for the upcoming year includes the following four objectives: (1) optimize value in select investments and redeploy capital to create additional value; (2) expand our active development pipeline; (3) extend the portfolio’s weighted average in-place lease term and increase occupancy in the Houston market to drive sustained cash flow growth; and (4) reduce leverage and extend our weighted average debt maturity. There can be no assurance regarding our achievement of any of our objectives.
Optimize value in select investments and redeploy capital to create additional value
We will seek to sell remaining properties located outside of our target growth markets and divest of select non-core properties in our target markets as we determine that capital can be more efficiently allocated for long-term value creation. In certain instances, we may reallocate capital between target growth markets to balance relative market concentration.

Expand our active development pipeline
Development will remain an important component of our strategy in 2018; however, we will remain disciplined as we continue our build-to-core development program. Provided certain conditions are met, we would look to proceed with the development of one or more of our remaining land sites in 2018 that are strategically located within our TIER1 submarkets. 
Extend the portfolio’s weighted average in-place lease term and increase occupancy in the Houston market to drive sustained cash flow growth
Our weighted average in-place lease term was 6.0 years as of December 31, 2017.  Through our recent and active development projects, we intend to extend our weighted average in-place lease term, which we believe provides protection from market and industry concentration as well as drives cash flow growth from both superior yields and lower recurring capital expenditures. Additionally, we will seek to increase occupancy in our Houston portfolio, which was 78.3% occupied as of December 31, 2017, compared to 93.9% for the balance of our portfolio.  
Reduce leverage and extend weighted average debt maturity date
We will continue to manage our balance sheet with a goal of reducing our leverage over the intermediate term. We anticipate further reducing our leverage through mark-to-market of in-place leases, delivery of our development properties, and occupancy gains. Additionally, we amended our credit facility in early 2018 to extend the maturity dates and added key new members to our lending group. 
Competition
We are subject to significant competition in seeking tenants for our properties.  The competition for creditworthy tenants is intense, and we have been required to provide rent concessions, incur charges for tenant improvements, and provide other inducements at a high level.  Without these inducements, we may not be able to continue to lease vacant space timely, or at all, which would adversely impact our results of operations.  We also compete with sellers of similar properties when we sell properties, which may result in our receiving lower proceeds from the sale, or which may result in our not being able to sell such properties due to the lack of an acceptable investment return.  Further, we may compete with other buyers and developers who are interested in properties we may acquire or develop, which may result in an increase in the amount that we would pay for such properties or may result in us ultimately not being able to acquire or develop such properties.  Some of our competitors, including larger REITs, have greater financial resources than we do and generally may be able to accept more risk. They also may enjoy competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies.
Regulations and Environmental Matters
Our properties and operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, requirements related to access and use by disabled persons, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution, and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity.  We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our properties.
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state, and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future.  However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on our properties.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 94 employees.

Financial Information About Industry Segments
Our current business consists of owning, acquiring, developing, operating, investing in, and selling real estate assets.  We internally evaluate operating performance on an individual property level and view each of our real estate assets as one individual operating segment. However, all of our properties are aggregated into one reportable segment as they have similar economic characteristics.
Available Information
We electronically file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, in each case including exhibits, and all amendments to those reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  Copies of our filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at www.tierreit.com or from the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.  Access to these filings is free of charge.  We are not incorporating any information from our website into this Form 10-K. 
SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
This summary supplements and updates the discussion contained under the caption “Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the prospectus contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on August 24, 2016, as supplemented by the discussion contained under the caption “Supplemental Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” in our prospectus supplement dated May 10, 2017, should be read in conjunction therewith and is subject to the qualifications set forth therein. This summary is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice. This discussion does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders of our securities in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances. 
On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “TCJA”) was signed into law. The provisions of the TCJA generally apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Significant provisions of the TCJA that investors should be aware of include provisions that: 

• | lower the corporate income tax rate to 21% and lower Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”) withholding on certain capital gain dividends to 21%;


• | provide noncorporate taxpayers with a deduction of up to 20% of certain income earned through partnerships and REITs for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026;


• | apply certain new limitations on net operating losses, which limitations may affect net operating losses generated by us or our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”);


• | expand the ability of businesses to deduct the cost of certain property investments in the year in which the property is purchased;


• | impose new accounting rules that generally require us to recognize income items for federal income tax purposes no later than when we take the item into account for financial statement purposes, which may accelerate our recognition of certain income items;


• | require a U.S. tax-exempt stockholder that is subject to tax on its unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”) to separately compute its taxable income and loss for each unrelated trade or business activity for purposes of determining its UBTI; and


• | generally lower tax rates for individuals and other noncorporate taxpayers for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026, while limiting deductions such as miscellaneous itemized deductions and state and local tax deductions.

In addition, the TCJA limits the deduction for net interest expense incurred by a business to 30% of the “adjusted taxable income” of the taxpayer. However, the limitation on the interest expense deduction does not apply to electing real property trades or businesses, such as any real property development, redevelopment, construction, reconstruction, acquisition, conversion, rental, operation, management, leasing, or brokerage trade or business. Making the election to be treated as a real property trade or business requires the electing real property trade or business to depreciate non-residential real property, residential rental property, and qualified improvement property over a longer period using the alternative depreciation system. We generally will decide whether to make any available election to treat as a real property trade or business any direct or indirect investment made through an entity that we control. 
Stockholders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the impact that the TCJA and other legislation may have on their investment and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on their investment in our stock.
