ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

The Company 
 Industrial Logistics Realty Trust Inc. (formerly known as Logistics Property Trust Inc.) is a Maryland corporation formed on August 12, 2014. As used herein, the terms Industrial Logistics Realty Trust, ILT, the Company, we, our, or us refer to Industrial Logistics Realty Trust Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where otherwise indicated. 
 We were formed to make equity and debt investments in income-producing real estate assets consisting primarily of high-quality distribution warehouses and other industrial properties that are leased to creditworthy corporate customers throughout the U.S. Although we intend to focus investment activities primarily on distribution warehouses and other industrial properties, our charter and bylaws do not preclude us from investing in other types of commercial property, real estate debt, or real estate related equity securities. As of December 31, 2016, we have neither purchased nor contracted to purchase any properties, debt, or real estate-related equity securities, nor have any probable acquisitions been identified. 
 We intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2016, and we intend to continue to operate in accordance with the requirements for qualification as a REIT. We utilize an Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust (UPREIT) organizational structure to hold all or substantially all of our assets through the operating partnership, ILT Operating Partnership LP (the Operating Partnership), a Delaware limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner and a limited partner. 
 On November 25, 2014, we filed an initial public offering of up to $2,000,000,000 in shares of our common stock (the Initial Public Offering), including $1,500,000,000 in shares of common stock offered at a price of $10.00 per Class A share and $9.4149 per class T share, and $500,000,000 in shares offered under our distribution reinvestment plan at a price of $9.50 per Class A share and $9.4149 per Class T share. The registration statement was subsequently declared effective by the SEC on February 18, 2016. 
 On July 1, 2016, we filed a post-effective amendment to our registration statement that reclassified our common stock offered pursuant to our registration statement into Class A shares, Class T shares and Class W shares. The SEC declared the post-effective amendment effective on August 8, 2016. Pursuant to our registration statement as amended, we are offering for sale up to $1,500,000,000 in shares of common stock in any combination of Class A shares, Class T shares and Class W shares at a price of $10.00 per Class A share, $9.4180 per Class T share and $9.0355 per Class W share, and up to $500,000,000 in shares under our distribution reinvestment plan in any combination of Class A shares, Class T shares and Class W shares at a price of $9.0355 per share. The net per share amount of distributions on Class T shares and Class W shares will be lower than the per share amount of distributions on Class A shares because of the distribution fees payable with respect to Class T shares and Class W shares sold in the primary offering. Our shares of common stock consist of Class A shares, Class T shares and Class W shares, all of which are collectively referred to herein as shares of common stock. The offering prices have been rounded to the nearest whole cent throughout this report. 
 On November 30, 2016, we received an aggregate of $2,000,000 in subscriptions for shares of our common stock from certain of our officers and officers of the Advisor and its affiliates, directly or indirectly. Accordingly, the Company received sufficient proceeds to satisfy the minimum offering requirements for the Initial Public Offering and the offering proceeds received from stockholders were released from escrow on November 30, 2016, with respect to all states other than the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington. Subscriptions from Ohio residents will not be released from escrow until subscriptions for shares totaling at least $7,000,000 have been received from all sources, subscriptions from Pennsylvania residents will not be released from escrow until subscriptions for shares totaling at least $75,000,000 have been received from all sources and subscriptions from Washington residents will not be released from escrow until subscriptions for shares totaling at least $10,000,000 have been received from all sources.

In addition, on December 1, 2016, we issued to each of 125 separate investors 56 Class A shares of common stock and 56 Class T shares of common stock. The purchase price for all shares was $8.90 per share. In the aggregate, we issued 7,000 Class A shares and 7,000 Class T shares for $124,600 (the Private Offering). We issued these shares of common stock in a private transaction exempt from the registration requirements pursuant to the Securities Act and Rule 506, promulgated thereunder. The Private Offering also included the issuance of 125 promissory notes in the principal amount of approximately $3,003 per note. Including the promissory notes, we raised an aggregate amount of $500,000 in the Private Offering. 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had raised gross proceeds of $2,500,000 from the sale of 235,349 shares of our common stock and the issuance of promissory notes in the public and private offerings. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning the public and private offerings and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning the promissory notes and the escrow agreement pursuant to which we deposited $481,410 of the total amount raised in the Private Offering with a third-party escrow agent. 
 Prior to the Initial Public Offering, our sole investor was the Advisor, which purchased 20,000 shares of our common stock. In addition, the Sponsor has been issued and owns partnership units in the Operating Partnership constituting a separate series of partnership interests with special distribution rights, which we refer to as the Special Units. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 The Advisor, the Sponsor and the Operating Partnership were formerly known as Logistics Property Advisors LLC, Logistics Property Advisors Group LLC and Logistics Property Operating Partnership LP, respectively. 
 We rely on the Advisor, a related party, to manage our day-to-day operating and acquisition activities and to implement our investment strategy pursuant to the terms of the third amended and restated advisory agreement, dated February 9, 2017 (the Advisory Agreement), by and among us, the Operating Partnership, and the Advisor. The current term of the Advisory Agreement ends February 9, 2018, subject to renewals by our board of directors for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods. The Advisor performs its duties and responsibilities under the Advisory Agreement as a fiduciary of us and our stockholders. The Advisor may, but is not required to, establish working capital reserves from proceeds from the Initial Public Offering, from cash flow generated by operating assets or from proceeds from the sale of assets. Working capital reserves are typically utilized to fund tenant improvements, leasing commissions, and major capital expenditures. Our lenders also may require working capital reserves. 
 Investment Objectives 
 Our primary investment objectives include the following: 
 

 | Preserving and protecting our stockholders capital contributions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Providing current income to our stockholders in the form of regular cash distributions; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Realizing capital appreciation upon the potential sale of our assets or other liquidity event.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There is no assurance that we will attain our investment objectives. Our charter places numerous limitations on us with respect to the manner in which we may invest our funds. In most cases these limitations cannot be changed unless our charter is amended, which may require the approval of our stockholders. 
 Investment Strategy 
 We intend to focus our investment activities on and use the proceeds raised in the offerings principally for building a national industrial warehouse operating company. Our investment activities include the acquisition, development and/or financing of income-producing real estate assets consisting primarily of high-quality 
 
2 
 
 distribution warehouses and other industrial properties that are leased to creditworthy corporate customers. Creditworthiness does not necessarily mean investment grade, and it is anticipated that much of our portfolio will be comprised of non-investment grade customers. We evaluate creditworthiness and financial strength of prospective customers based on financial, operating and business plan information that is provided to us by such prospective customers, as well as other market and economic information that is generally publicly available. 
 The number and type of properties we may acquire or develop will depend upon real estate market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time we make our investments. Although we expect that our investment activities will focus primarily on distribution warehouses and other industrial properties, our charter and bylaws do not preclude us from investing in other types of commercial property or real estate-related debt. However, we will not invest more than 25% of net proceeds we receive from the sale of shares of our common stock in the offerings in other types of commercial property or real estate-related debt. 
 Our investment in any distribution warehouse, other industrial property, or other property type will be based upon the best interests of our company and our stockholders as determined by the Advisor and our board of directors. Real estate assets in which we may invest may be acquired or developed either directly by us or through joint ventures or other co-ownership arrangements with affiliated or unaffiliated third parties, and may include: equity investments in commercial properties; mortgage, mezzanine, construction, bridge, and other loans related to real estate; and investments in other real estate-related entities, including REITs, private real estate funds, real estate management companies, real estate development companies, and debt funds, both foreign and domestic. Subject to the 25% limitation described above, we may invest in any of these asset classes, including those that present greater risk than industrial.
 Business Strategy 
 We seek to provide income in the form of regular cash distributions to our stockholders by generating sustained internal growth in rental income. The keys to long-term rental income growth are maintaining a stabilized occupancy rate (generally above 90%) through active leasing efforts, negotiating contractual rent increases on existing leases and renewals on expiring leases, cultivating strong customer relationships, and controlling operating expenses. 
Financing Objectives 
 We may use secured and unsecured debt as a means of providing additional funds for the acquisition of assets, to pay distributions, and for other corporate purposes. While a large percentage of our debt financings may typically be comprised of long-term, fixed rate loans, our use of leverage generally increases the risk of default on loan payments and the resulting foreclosure on a particular asset. Upon a default, our lenders may also have recourse to assets other than those specifically securing the repayment of the indebtedness. Our ability to enhance our investment returns and to increase our diversification by acquiring assets using additional funds provided through borrowings could be adversely impacted if the credit markets are closed or limited and banks and other lending institutions impose severe restrictions on the amount of funds available for the types of loans we seek. We may source institutional or other capital through joint venture or other co-partnerships to help diversify risk associated with development and value-add opportunities. See Item 1A, Risk FactorsRisks Related to Debt Financing for further detail. 
 Competition 
 The market for the acquisition of industrial real estate is highly competitive. We compete for real property investments with other REITs and institutional investors, such as pension funds and their advisors, private real estate investment funds, insurance company investment accounts, private investment companies, individuals and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, including certain other entities sponsored or advised by affiliates of the Sponsor, including DPF and IPT, as defined below in Conflicts of Interest, some of which 
 
3 
 
 have greater financial resources than we do and generally may be able to accept more risk, including risks relating to the creditworthiness of potential customers, the breadth of the markets in which to invest, or the level of leverage they are willing to take on. They also may possess significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital or greater operating efficiencies associated with a larger platform. 
 The market for the leasing of industrial real estate is also very competitive. We will experience competition for customers from other existing assets in proximity to our buildings, as well as from proposed new developments. As a result, we may have to provide free rental periods, incur charges for tenant improvements, or offer other inducements, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 Conflicts of Interest 
 We are subject to various potential conflicts of interest that could arise out of our relationship with the Advisor and other affiliates and related parties, including: conflicts related to the compensation arrangements among the Advisor, certain affiliates and related parties, and us; conflicts with respect to the allocation of the Advisors and its key personnels time; conflicts related to our potential acquisition of assets from affiliates of the Advisor; and conflicts with respect to the allocation of investment opportunities. Further, entities currently sponsored by or that in the future may be advised by affiliates of the Sponsor, including, without limitation, Industrial Property Trust, Inc. (IPT), Dividend Capital Diversified Property Fund Inc. (DPF), DC Industrial Liquidating Trust (the Liquidating Trust), and those in which Sponsor-affiliated or related entities own interests, may compete with us and have been given priority over us with respect to the acquisition of certain types of investments. As a result of our potential competition with these entities, certain investment opportunities that would otherwise be available to us may not in fact be available. In addition, an affiliate of the Advisor entered into a management services agreement with the Liquidating Trust to provide certain development, construction, and asset management oversight services for each of the Liquidating Trusts properties, to assist in the sale of the Liquidating Trusts properties, and to provide administrative services to the Liquidating Trust and its subsidiaries. This affiliate will not provide advisory services with respect to acquisitions to the Liquidating Trust. See Item 1A, Risk FactorsRisks Related to the Advisor and Its Affiliates, for additional detail. The independent directors have an obligation to function on our behalf in all situations in which a conflict of interest may arise and have a fiduciary obligation to act on behalf of our stockholders. 
Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Laws 
 Properties that we acquire, and the properties underlying our investments, are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances, and regulations. Under these laws, ordinances, and regulations, a current or previous owner of real estate (including, in certain circumstances, a secured lender that succeeds to ownership or control of a property) may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at, on, under, or in its property. These laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or control party knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of investigation, remediation, or removal of these substances may be substantial and could exceed the value of the property. An owner or control party of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site. Certain environmental laws also impose liability in connection with the handling of or exposure to materials containing asbestos. These laws allow third parties to seek recovery from owners of properties for personal injuries associated with materials containing asbestos. Our operating costs and the values of these assets may be adversely affected by the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws, ordinances, and regulations, as well as the cost of complying with future legislation, and our income and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be affected adversely by the existence of an environmental liability with respect to our properties. We will endeavor to ensure our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal, state and local laws, ordinances, and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products.
