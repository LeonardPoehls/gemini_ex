Our Company
We are a leading cloud-based platform provider for the mortgage finance industry. Our technology solutions are used by lenders to originate and close residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2017, approximately 184,000 mortgage professionals used Encompass for their mortgage management solution.
Our Encompass digital mortgage software is a comprehensive, end-to-end enterprise solution that handles most of the functions involved in running the business of originating mortgages including: marketing; lead management; loan origination; loan processing; underwriting; preparation of mortgage applications, disclosure agreements, and closing documents; funding and closing the loan for the borrower; compliance with regulatory and investor requirements and overall enterprise management that provides one system of record for loans. Delivery of our Encompass software in an on-demand Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, environment provides customers with the added benefits of lower up front implementation costs and reduced need for an infrastructure of servers, storage and network devices as well as the staff needed to support the infrastructure. SaaS delivery of Encompass enables access to the most current version of our software, including periodic upgrades and regulatory updates. We also host the Ellie Mae Network, a proprietary electronic platform that allows Encompass users to conduct electronic business transactions with mortgage investors (also referred to as “investors”) and service providers they work with in order to process and fund loans.
For mortgage originators, Encompass is a comprehensive digital mortgage solution that handles key business and management functions involved in running a residential mortgage origination business. Mortgage originators use Encompass as a single tool for marketing, loan origination, processing, and customer communication, and to interact electronically with lenders, investors, and service providers over the Ellie Mae Network. For lenders, investors and service providers on the Ellie Mae Network, we provide electronic connectivity that allows them to do business with mortgage origination professionals using Encompass. We also offer Encompass users a variety of other on-demand software services delivered within Encompass which are discussed below in our Products and Services overview.
Mortgage originators pay for Encompass in one of two models: recurring monthly subscription fees or fees based on the number of loans closed, subject to base fees, which we refer to as Success-Based Pricing. Our additional services are paid on either a subscription or transaction basis. Lenders, investors and service providers participating in the Ellie Mae Network also pay us fees, generally on a per transaction basis, for transactions processed through the Ellie Mae Network from Encompass users.

Mortgage Industry Overview
Overview of Mortgage Origination Market
Mortgage originators typically advise borrowers, process loan files, collect, and verify the property and borrower data upon which lending decisions are based and, in the majority of cases, fund and close mortgage loans. According to data available pursuant to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (“HMDA”), there were more than 6,000(1) mortgage lenders in 2017 in the United States, including national banks, regional banks, non-bank lenders and credit unions. 
Based on estimates provided by the Mortgage Bankers Association, there were $1.7 trillion, $2.1 trillion(2), $1.7 trillion, $1.3 trillion and $1.8 trillion in loans originated for 1- to 4-family homes during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
The Mortgage Origination Process
Originating a residential mortgage involves multiple parties and requires a complex series of data-laden transactions that must be handled accurately under tight time constraints. By the time a mortgage has been funded, the typical loan package contains over one thousand pages of documents that come from over a dozen different entities, usually operating on disparate technology systems and databases. Traditionally, much of the data used to prepare these documents has been gathered manually, rather than electronically, with documents exchanged among the many participants by facsimile, courier or mail. The entire process results in significant duplicative efforts, time delays, errors, costs, and redundant paper documentation, and often exposes borrower data to potential privacy and security breaches.

The following diagram of the mortgage origination process provides a framework for understanding the complexity and inefficiency of the process and the need for automated solutions. 
In addition to the challenges involved in processing loans, mortgage originators must satisfy a multitude of federal, state and local regulations, and address basic business needs, including marketing, sales, product fulfillment, customer support, reporting, and general management functions. Historically, most mortgage originators have operated their businesses using separate task-specific software applications that were interconnected, if at all, through customized integrations. This often resulted in constraints on effective collaboration among operating departments, limited ability to monitor the business comprehensively, increased risk of error due to inconsistent data, failure to incorporate current regulations into work flows, inadequate security and control over the process, and expensive technical integration and maintenance costs.
Recent Mortgage Industry Trends and Developments
The residential mortgage industry continues to evolve and undergo significant changes. There are six major trends that are currently impacting the residential mortgage industry.
Greater Focus on Operational Efficiencies
The average total production cost per loan was $8,060 in the third quarter of 2017.(3) We expect operational costs to continue to be a significant consideration for mortgage originators due to the continuously changing regulatory environment and heightened quality standards. As a result, mortgage originators have sought to increase their efficiency and reduce fixed expenses, leading them to explore technology solutions to automate their business processes as well as methods to avoid or reduce expenses that are not tied to revenue generating activities.

Customers Adopting Multi-Channel Strategies
Customers are developing multi-channel strategies beyond a single retail, correspondent or wholesale mortgage lending channel in order to grow their businesses. The requirements of these different channels vary, and in order to maintain a single operating system, customers must use a robust system with customizable functionality.
Changes in Regulations Affecting Lenders and Investors
Mortgage lending regulations continue to change and many regulatory reforms have been introduced or proposed in recent years to promote increased underwriting standards and accountability by lenders and mortgage originators, ensure meaningful disclosures by lenders to borrowers, increase the transparency and objectivity of settlement services, and protect consumers in the mortgage market from unfair or abusive lending practices. Many of the significant changes in regulations were issued in 2014 and 2015, including legal changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and associated regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”). The CFPB has subsequently amended, revised and expanded regulations under its authority and is expected to continue exerting its influence over the regulated workings of the mortgage industry. Changes to CFPB leadership may further affect regulatory compliance requirements. Congress is also considering legislation affecting the mortgage industry. These changes have complicated the mortgage origination process and increased the amount of documentation required to originate and fund residential mortgages. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in our products and services to address statutory and regulatory changes.
Consumer Demand for a Digital Based Experience from Lenders
Today’s borrowers expect transparency, service and speed, and a human touch. To meet these requirements, lenders must offer a seamless, online experience that continues even after the application has been submitted. Lenders should have access to current and historical data on every individual borrower, and provide an intuitive borrower portal that offers a simple, transparent interaction, the ability to easily upload documents, and real-time status updates.
Increased Quality Standards Imposed by Regulators, Lenders and Investors
Lenders have eliminated many high-risk loan product offerings and significantly tightened underwriting and processing requirements. Similarly, investors seek higher-quality, lower-risk loans in which to invest. Consistent with these tightened standards and expectations, lenders and investors are demanding increased levels of documentation of the data upon which a lending decision will be based, increased use of third-party services to obtain unbiased and independent verification of borrowers’ creditworthiness, greater proof of the adequacy of the collateral securing mortgages and strict compliance with regulatory requirements. This trend further increases the amount of documentation and number of services required to originate and fund residential mortgages. Increased enforcement by federal and state regulators continues to encourage mortgage originators to explore technology solutions that provide adequate controls and policy enforcement to facilitate the origination of compliant loans.
Greater focus by customers and regulators on data security and consumer privacy
Recent high-profile data security incidents affecting banking institutions and their third-party service providers have resulted in an increased focus on data security by our customers and our customers’ regulators. We expect the industry focus on data security to continue to increase as companies generate greater amounts of data and as future data security incidents occur.
Our Strategy
Our mission is to be the industry standard platform for residential mortgage origination in the United States. Key elements of our strategy include:
Increase the number of lenders using Encompass and the number of loans originated on our platform.  We continue to focus our marketing, sales and product development efforts on increasing the number of mortgage lenders, commercial banks and credit unions using Encompass and our additional services, and the number of loans originated on our platform. We expect many non-Encompass mortgage lenders to assess new platform options and adopt Encompass in an effort to gain efficiency and meet quality standards and compliance mandates. We intend to continue to focus our efforts on all market segments, including the largest, or enterprise segment, of the lending industry.
Increase adoption and utilization of Ellie Mae solutions and services. We intend to encourage increased adoption and utilization by our Encompass customers of the various products and services we currently offer, such as customer relationship and lead management, document preparation, compliance services, product and pricing services, fraud services, income tax verification services and flood services. As our customers opt for supplemental on-demand software and services, we generate additional revenues. By encouraging our customers to use these through the Encompass platform, we can help offer the lender greater efficiency and cost savings, and continue to drive additional revenue per loan originated on Encompass.
5

Create a true digital mortgage platform. We continue to expand into a more complete digital mortgage strategy to benefit our customers. It is our goal to provide a true digital mortgage process that enables the lender to originate more loans, lower origination costs, reduce the time to close and make smarter decisions through data and predictive analytics, all while ensuring the highest levels of compliance, quality and efficiency. Our digital mortgage vision encompasses all phases of the mortgage loan lifecycle, with each milestone informing the next. The market will require lenders to adapt, as the pressure to meet closing dates, increased competition, and the emerging high-tech and human touch expectations of borrowers continues to drive the use of the next generation of technology.
Invest in new product and platform development.  We are investing in the development of the next generation of our Encompass platform, which we call Encompass NG, as well as the Encompass Connect solutions, each of which is built on the new Encompass Lending Platform and utilize Application Program Interfaces (“APIs”) to offer unique capabilities that help improve visibility and collaboration between loan officers, third-party originators, developers and homebuyers.
Increase our customers’ use of, and the services integrated into, the Ellie Mae Network.  The Ellie Mae Network provides mortgage originators electronic access to many of the investors and service providers that they interact with in order to process and fund loans. These transactions include electronic ordering of credit reports, appraisal services, title and flood reports and accessing the automatic underwriting systems of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We will continue to promote service ordering by our Encompass customers through the Ellie Mae Network as well as encourage providers of settlement services to deliver these services electronically through the Ellie Mae Network.
Investment in our business.  We are investing aggressively in initiatives that we believe will help us continue to grow our business, improve our products and services, and strengthen our competitive advantage while bringing sustainable, long-term value to our customers. During 2017, we increased our investments in our sales and client services capabilities, research and development, technology infrastructure, and data security to support our customer additions and overall business growth. In order to continue supporting our customers and to further differentiate ourselves, we currently anticipate that throughout 2018 we will continue to invest in key areas such as research and development, enterprise sales, services, technical support, and data security. This investment will include the development of our hybrid cloud infrastructure to accommodate the increasing number of loans processed on our platform and our next generation Encompass Lending Platform and capabilities, which we expect to continue to roll out to customers in 2018 and 2019.
Acquisitions.  Our industry is highly fragmented, and we are evaluating strategic opportunities available to acquire technology-based companies that will complement and increase the attractiveness of our solutions. In October 2017, we acquired Velocify, Inc. (“Velocify”), a leading cloud-based sales engagement platform that provides customers the capabilities to generate and manage leads and customer relationships. The acquisition of Velocify accelerates our vision of offering a fully digital mortgage. We expect to continue to evaluate and explore strategic opportunities that will enhance the breadth and depth of our solutions, and furthers our mission of automating the entire end-to-end mortgage process for our customers.

We have and will continue to commit significant resources to protect against and remedy any potential security breaches and their consequences and intend to keep doing so in the future. In 2017, we made major investments in our network security infrastructure, encryption of customer data, end-point security, and cybersecurity threat intelligence, including headcount and third-party tools and systems. In 2018 and beyond, we will continue to invest in our security infrastructure to protect the confidentiality and integrity of our customer data.
Research and Development
We devote substantial resources to enhance the features and functionality of our offerings as well as developing new products and services. We are developing the next generation Encompass platform, including the Encompass Connect solutions that leverage our new APIs and platform capabilities. These new products include our Encompass Consumer Connect solution to better equip our customers to deploy customized borrower-facing websites, Encompass TPO Connect which helps our customers better manage third-party originations with their partners, Encompass Loan Officer Connect which exposes a rich set of loan officer-facing functionality on mobile devices, Encompass Developer Connect which provides developers with APIs, tools and developer portal, and Encompass Data Connect which gives lenders access to all of their loan data in near real time.
We will also deliver enhancements to our offerings in support of compliance updates such as the 2018 HMDA collection and reporting changes.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in large part on our proprietary products and technology for which we seek protection from a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws and other agreements with employees and third parties. We require our officers, employees, and consultants to enter into standard agreements containing provisions requiring the confidentiality of proprietary information and assignment to us of all inventions made during the course of their employment or consulting relationship. We also enter into nondisclosure agreements with our commercial counterparties and limit access to, and distribution of, our confidential information.
We are committed to developing and protecting our intellectual property and, where appropriate, file patent applications to protect our technology. Our existing patents expire between 2020 and 2035. Our present and future patents may provide only limited protection for our technology and may not be sufficient to provide competitive advantages to us. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights. Competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technology we offer in our products and services. 
We hold a number of registered and unregistered trademarks, service names and domain names that are used in our business in the United States.
Competition
The mortgage origination software market is highly competitive. We compete against software providers based on our ability to provide:

• | a comprehensive, integrated software solution that provides all business-critical functions including customer acquisition, loan processing, task management, communication with borrowers and other mortgage origination participants, reporting, regulatory compliance, and general enterprise management;


• | solutions that create efficiencies in gathering, reviewing, and verifying mortgage-related data and producing accurate documentation;


• | on-demand solutions that reduce the need for IT infrastructure and overhead while providing the ability to update capabilities and adopt new regulations in a timely manner;


• | customizable business rules to automate processes, promote accountability, and enforce business practices that help assure loan quality and regulatory compliance;

12


• | a database architecture designed to reduce data errors and facilitate collaboration among departments within a mortgage origination company and comprehensive monitoring of the business of the entire enterprise;


• | attractive pricing options, such as our Success-Based Pricing model, allowing customers to time payments to cash flow;


• | an integrated network to submit loan files electronically and securely to lenders and electronically order all of the services necessary to originate a loan;


• | a solution that is secure and maintains the confidentiality of sensitive data; and


• | a solution that is reliable with minimal planned and unplanned downtime.

Our end-to-end mortgage origination software solution, Encompass, competes with many software providers catering to mortgage brokerages and mortgage lenders. Our principal software competitors include: Byte Software Inc; Calyx Technology, Inc.; DH Corporation now Finastra; LendingQB; Mortgage Builder Software, Inc.; Mortgage Cadence, an Accenture Company; Wipro Gallagher Solutions, Inc.; and Black Knight Financial Technology Solutions, LLC (LoanSphere Empower and LoanSphere LendingSpace). Some of these software providers, including Calyx Technology, Inc. and Black Knight Financial Technology Solutions, LLC, also provide connectivity between their software users and lenders and service providers. 
We also compete against other service providers that offer various competing software services not only based on the quality of the service we offer, but also on the integration of each specific service provided within our Encompass platform’s overall workflow. We believe that the integration of the services with Encompass enhances mortgage originators’ control over their processes with the critical result of reducing errors and costs through the seamless exchange of data across applications and services which Encompass offers. 
Our principal functional service competitors include:
Borrower-facing Mortgage Originator Website providers, including: D+H Corporation; Blend Labs, Inc.; Cloudvirga, Inc.; and Blue Igloo, Inc. (dba Roostify).
Document Preparation Services providers, including: DigitalDocs, Inc.; DocMagic Inc.; IDS, Inc. (International Doc Services); DocuTech, LLC; Docu Prep, Inc.; Mortgage Resources Group, LLC; and Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc.
Compliance Services providers including: Interthinx, Inc.; and LogicEase Solutions, Inc. (ComplianceEase).
Product and Pricing Services providers, including: Mortech, Inc.; LoanLogics, Inc.; Optimal Blue, LLC; and Cre8tech Labs Inc. (LenderPrice).
Electronic Document Management providers, including: Conduent, Inc. (BlitzDocs); and VirPack Corporation.
The Ellie Mae Network is our proprietary method of facilitating our Encompass customers’ ability to choose from, and connect with, a broad array of mortgage lenders and third-party service providers essential for the processing and funding of loans, and is only available to mortgage originators using Encompass. Its principal competition remains traditional methods of exchanging data and documents among mortgage industry participants, such as by email, facsimile, phone, courier, and mail. In addition, mortgage originators may use a standalone web browser to go individually to each investor, lender, or service provider’s website and then manually upload loan data or enter information into that website. Mortgage originators may continue to use these methods due to habit, personal business relationships or for other reasons, despite the disadvantages of duplicative efforts, time delays, errors and costs, redundant paper documentation, and potential privacy and security breaches.
Lenders and service providers, including those who participate on the Ellie Mae Network, can and do connect with mortgage originators that are not Encompass users in a variety of ways, including through other networks between mortgage originators and lenders, and service providers such as Black Knight, Inc.
We compete with respect to the Ellie Mae Network based on:

• | offering mortgage originators accessibility to a critical mass of investors, lenders, and service providers;


• | enabling mortgage originators to transact all aspects of the mortgage origination process over the network.; and


• | providing investors, lenders, and service providers with superior technological connectivity with mortgage originators, which enables them to lower costs, reduce errors and increase speed.

Our future financial condition and operating results depend on our ability to continue to develop and offer new products and services. We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors; however, some of our actual and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources.

Government Regulation
The U.S. mortgage industry is heavily regulated. Mortgage originators, lenders, investors, and service providers with which we do business are subject to federal, state, and local laws that regulate and restrict the manner in which they operate in the residential mortgage industry, including Regulation X of RESPA, Regulation Z of TILA, the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act, and the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, as amended. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act increased regulation of the mortgage industry, including: generally prohibiting lenders from making residential mortgage loans unless a good faith determination is made of a borrower’s creditworthiness based on verified and documented information; requiring the CFPB to enact regulations to help assure that consumers are provided with timely and understandable information about residential mortgage loans that protect them against unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices; and requiring federal regulators to establish minimum national underwriting guidelines for residential mortgages that lenders will be allowed to securitize and sell to third-party investors without retaining any of the loans’ default risk. Although we are not directly subject to these laws and regulations, changes to these laws and regulations could broaden the scope of parties or activities subject to regulation and require us to comply with their restrictions, and new products and services developed by us may be subject to, or have to reflect, these laws or regulations.
In addition, we are subject to general business laws and regulations, regulations governing federal contractors, and laws and regulations specifically governing the Internet, such as those covering taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access, and the characteristics and quality of services.
Employees
At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1,480 full-time employees, including 220 in sales and marketing, 1,095 in research and development and technology, and 165 in general and administrative functions. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
