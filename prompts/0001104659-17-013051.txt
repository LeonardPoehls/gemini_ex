Item 1.           Business
 
Dover Motorsports, Inc. is a public holding company that is a leading marketer and promoter of motorsports entertainment in the United States.  Through our subsidiaries, we own and operate Dover International Speedway® in Dover, Delaware and Nashville Superspeedway® near Nashville, Tennessee.  Our Dover facility promoted the following six events during 2016, all of which were under the auspices of the premier sanctioning body in motorsports - the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR):
 
·                  2 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series events;
 ·                  2 NASCAR XFINITY Series events;
 ·                  1 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series event; and
 ·                  1 NASCAR K&N Pro Series East event.
 
In 2017, we are scheduled to promote these same six events at Dover International Speedway.  Total revenues from these events were approximately 97% of total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
 
We have hosted the Firefly Music Festival (Firefly) on our property in Dover, Delaware for five consecutive years and it is scheduled to return on June 15-18, 2017.  The inaugural three day festival with 40 musical acts was held in July 2012 and this years event in Dover was held on June 16-19, 2016 with over 110 musical acts.  In September 2014, Red Frog Events LLC formed RFGV Festivals LLC - a joint venture with Goldenvoice that promotes Firefly.  Goldenvoice is owned by AEG Live, one of the worlds largest presenters of live music and entertainment events.  We entered into an amended agreement with RFGV Festivals granting them two 5 year options to extend our facility rental agreement through 2032 (from its original expiration date of 2022) in exchange for a rental commitment to secure our property for up to two festivals per year. Rent is at differing rates depending on how many events are actually held.  On June 26-28, 2015, the Big Barrel Country Music Festival was held at our facility.  The three day festival was promoted by RFGV Festivals and featured 40 musical acts.  On January 28, 2016, RFGV Festivals announced it would not promote the Big Barrel Country Music Festival in 2016 and there is no plan for a second festival in 2017.  In addition to the facility rental fee, we also receive a percentage of the concession sales we manage at the events.
 
We generate revenues primarily from the following sources:
 
·                  rights fees obtained for television and radio broadcasts of our events;
 ·                  ticket sales;
 ·                  sponsorship payments;
 ·                  luxury suite rentals;
 ·                  hospitality tent rentals and catering;
 ·                  concessions and vendor commissions for the right to sell concessions and souvenirs at our facilities;
 ·                  expo space rentals; and
 ·                  track and facility rentals and other event-related revenues.
 
We began our motorsports operations in 1969 in Dover, Delaware.  Our predecessor, Dover Downs, Inc., was also engaged in harness horse racing operations and later ran our other gaming operations.  As a result of several restructurings, our operations were segregated into two main operating subsidiaries - Dover International Speedway, Inc., incorporated in 1994, encompassed our motorsports operations, and Dover Downs, Inc., incorporated in 1967, conducted our gaming operations.

Effective March 31, 2002, we spun-off our gaming business which was then owned by our subsidiary, Dover Downs Gaming & Entertainment, Inc. (Gaming).  On a tax-free basis, we made a pro rata distribution of all of the capital stock of Gaming to our stockholders.  Our continuing operations subsequent to the spin-off consist solely of our motorsports activities and property rentals.
 
In April 2001, we opened Nashville Superspeedway  a motorsports complex approximately 35 miles from downtown Nashville in Wilson County, Tennessee.  Nashville Superspeedway no longer promotes NASCAR events and has not entered into sanction agreements with NASCAR since 2011.  We currently use the facility on a limited basis for motorsports track rentals.
 
On August 25, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Nashville facility to an entity owned by Panattoni Development Company for $27.5 million in cash and the assumption by the buyer of obligations of ours under certain Variable Rate Tax Exempt Infrastructure Revenue Bonds.  Under the agreement, as amended on January 22, 2017, the sale is scheduled to close in the second quarter of 2017.  Our gain would be the $27.5 million purchase price less the facilitys $26 million carrying value and less any costs to sell which are expected to be minimal and consist primarily of legal fees.  We also expect to pay income taxes of approximately $5 million as a result of this transaction. The assets of Nashville Superspeedway are reported as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016 and 2015.  Our balance sheet includes a $1,802,000 provision for contingent obligation reflecting the present value of the estimated portion of the revenue bonds debt service that may not be covered by the projected sales and incremental property taxes from the facility.  Upon completion of the sale of the assets of Nashville Superspeedway, we will no longer be responsible for this obligation and will reverse it which will increase our pre-tax earnings by the amount of the obligation at the time it is reversed.  See NOTE 11  Commitments and Contingencies of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document for further discussion.
 
Dover International Speedway
 
We have promoted NASCAR-sanctioned racing events for 48 consecutive years at Dover International Speedway and currently promote six NASCAR-sanctioned events at the facility annually.  Two races are in the NASCAR Cup Series professional stock car racing circuit, two races are in the NASCAR XFINITY Series racing circuit, one race is in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series racing circuit and one race is in the NASCAR K&N Pro Series East racing circuit.  Prior to 2017, the NASCAR Cup Series was sponsored by Sprint.  The series has been rebranded as the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series for events in 2017 and 2018 (and for an additional two years if Monster Energy exercises its renewal option).
 
Each of the NASCAR XFINITY Series events, the Camping World Truck Series event and the K&N Pro Series East event at Dover International Speedway are conducted on the days before a NASCAR Cup Series event.  Dover International Speedway is one of only seven speedways in North America that presents two NASCAR Cup Series events and two NASCAR XFINITY Series events each year.  Additionally, it is one of only nine tracks to host three major NASCAR events at one facility on the same weekend.  The spring and fall event dates have historically allowed Dover International Speedway to hold the first and last NASCAR Cup Series events in the Maryland to Maine region each year.  Our fall event was the third of ten races in the Chase for the NASCAR Cup (rebranded the Playoff for 2017), an elimination format which determines the NASCAR Cup Series champion for the racing season.  The XFINITY Series and the Camping World Truck Series have also moved to a playoff format.  Our fall XFINITY Series event was the second of seven races in the Chase for the NASCAR XFINITY Cup (rebranded the Playoff for 2017).
 
Dover International Speedway, widely known as the Monster Mile®, is a high-banked, one-mile, concrete superspeedway with permanent grandstand seating capacity of approximately 85,000.  Unlike some superspeedways, substantially all grandstand and skybox seats offer an unobstructed view of the entire track.  The concrete racing surface makes Dover International Speedway the only concrete superspeedway (one mile or greater in length) that conducts NASCAR Cup Series events.  The superspeedway facility also features the Monster Bridge®.  The climate controlled bridge spans across the width of the superspeedway at a height of 29 feet and houses 50-luxury seats, a refreshment bar and other amenities.  The Monster Bridge is the only one of its kind in the motorsports industry.

Agreements with NASCAR
 
Our most recent sanction agreements with NASCAR are for a five year period (2016-2020).  Pursuant to the typical sanction agreement, NASCAR grants its sanction to a promoter, such as Dover International Speedway, to organize, promote and hold a particular competition.  The promoter sells tickets to the competition, sells or arranges for the sale of merchandise and concessions, and sells advertising, sponsorships and hospitality services.  NASCAR conducts the competition, arranges for the drivers, and has sole control over the competition, including the right to require alterations to the promoters facility and the right to approve or disapprove any advertising or sponsorship of the promoter.  NASCAR also has exclusive rights to exploit live broadcast and certain broadcast and intellectual property rights related to the competition, and exclusive rights to sponsorship and promotional rights relative to the series to which a particular competition belongs.  The promoter must pay the sanction fee and purse monies and receives a share of the live broadcast revenue contracted for by NASCAR.  The promoter is responsible for the condition of the facility, for compliance with laws, for control of the public, for fire and medical equipment and personnel, for security, for insurance and for providing facilities and services required by NASCAR officials and the live broadcast personnel.
 
Dover International Speedway, Inc. has entered into two sanction agreements with NASCAR pursuant to which it will organize and promote two NASCAR Cup Series events in 2016 through 2020.  Our business is substantially dependent on these two agreements.
 
Under the terms of our sanction agreements, NASCAR retains 10% of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each NASCAR-sanctioned event as a component of its sanction fee.  The remaining 90% is recorded as revenue.  The event promoter is required to pay 25% of the gross broadcast rights fees to the event as part of the awards to the competitors, which we record as operating expenses.
 
Competition
 
Our racing events compete with other racing events sanctioned by various racing bodies and with other sports and recreational events scheduled on or around the same dates.  Racing events sanctioned by different organizations are often held on the same dates at different tracks.  The quality of the competition, type of racing event, caliber of the event, sight lines, ticket pricing, location and customer conveniences and amenities, among other things, differentiate the motorsports facilities.  We also compete with improving and expanding media coverage and content by network and cable broadcasters.
Seasonality
 
We derive substantially all of our total revenues from admissions, television broadcast rights and other event-related revenue attributable to two major motorsports event weekends held in the spring and fall.  As a result, our business is highly seasonal.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 52 full-time employees and 5 part-time employees.  We engage temporary personnel to assist during our motorsports racing season.  We believe that we enjoy a good relationship with our employees.
