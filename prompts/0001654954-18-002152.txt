 As used in this annual report, "we", "us", "our", "CBMG", "Company" or "our company" refers to Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc. and, unless the context otherwise requires, all of its subsidiaries or deemed controlled companies.
 Overview
  
 Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, principally engaged in the development of therapies for cancer and degenerative diseases utilizing proprietary cell-based technologies. Our technology includes two major platforms: (i) Immune cell therapy for treatment of a broad range of cancer indications comprised of technologies in Chimeric Antigen Receptor modified T cells (CAR-T), T-Cell Receptor (TCR), cancer vaccine, and ex vivo expanded autologous Central Memory T Cells (Tcm), and (ii) human adipose-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (haMPC) for treatment of joint and autoimmune diseases. CBMG’s Research & Development facilities are based in China and the U.S., and its manufacturing facilities are based in China in the cities of Shanghai, Wuxi, and Beijing.
  
 We are focused on developing and marketing safe and effective cell-based therapies based on our cellular platforms, to treat cancer, orthopedic diseases and metabolic diseases. We have developed proprietary technologies and know-hows in our cell therapy platforms. Our primary target market is Greater China. We believe that our cell-based therapies will be able to help patients with high unmet medical needs. We expect to carry out clinical studies leading to the eventual CFDA approval of our products through Biologics License Application (BLA) filings and authorized clinical centers throughout Greater China. 
  
 We are conducting clinical studies in China with our stem cell based therapies to treat knee osteoarthritis (“KOA”). We have completed a Phase IIb autologous haMPC KOA clinical study and published its promising results. Led by Shanghai Renji Hospital, one of the largest teaching hospitals in China, we have also completed a Phase I clinical trial of our off-the-shelf allogeneic haMPC (AlloJoinTM) therapy for treating KOA patients. In addition, we have received an award of $2.29 million grant from California Institute of Regenerative Medicine’s (CIRM) and we have started manufacturing AlloJoinTM product in California to support preclinical and clinical studies in the United States for the KOA indication.
  
 We have launched multiple clinical trials using our CAR-T products in multiple indications such as Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and Acute Lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We may also establish partnerships with other companies for co-development in CAR-T, TCR-T and stem cell based therapies. We are striving to build a highly competitive research and development function, a translational medicine unit, along with a well-established cellular manufacturing capability and ample capacity, to support the development of multiple assets in multiple indications. These efforts will allow us to boost the Company's Immuno-Oncology presence and pave the way for additional future partnerships.
  
  Corporate History
  
 Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware and its corporate headquarters is located at 19925 Stevens Creek Blvd., Suite 100 in Cupertino, California. The Company is focusing its resources on becoming a biotechnology company bringing therapies to improve the health of patients in China.
  
 Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly known as EastBridge Investment Group Corporation), was originally incorporated in the State of Arizona on June 25, 2001. The Company's principal activity through June 30, 2005 was to manufacture mobile entertainment products.
  
 In 2005, the Company decided to exit the mobile entertainment market and dedicate its activities to providing investment related services in Asia, with a strong focus on high GDP growth countries, such as China. The Company concentrated its efforts in the Far East (Hong Kong, mainland China, Australia) and in the United States and sought to provide consulting services necessary for small to medium-size companies to obtain capital to grow their business, either to become public companies in the United States or to find joint venture partners or raise capital to expand their businesses.
  
 On February 6, 2013, the Company completed a merger to acquire Cellular Biomedicine Group Ltd. In connection with the merger, effective on March 5, 2013, the Company (formerly named “EastBridge Investment Group Corporation”) changed its name to “Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc.” In addition in March 2013 we changed our corporate headquarters from Arizona to California. 
 
From February 6, 2013 to June 23, 2014, we operated the Company in two separate reportable segments: (i) Biomedicine Cell Therapy (“Biomedicine”); and (ii) Financial Consulting (“Consulting”).  The Consulting segment was conducted through EastBridge Sub.  On June 23, 2014, the Company announced the discontinuation of the Consulting segment as it no longer fit into management’s long-term strategy and vision.  The Company is continuing to focus its resources on becoming a biotechnology company bringing therapies to improve the health of patients in China.
  
 On September 26, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Beijing Agreen Biotechnology Co. Ltd. ("AG") and the U.S. patent held by AG’s founder. AG is a biotech company with operations in China, engaged in the development of treatments for cancerous diseases utilizing proprietary cell technologies, which include without limitation, preparation of subset T Cell and clonality assay platform technology for treatment of a broad range of cancers.

 Power of Attorney from Lu Junfeng.  Through the WFOE we are the recipient of a power of attorney executed by Lu Junfeng on October 26, 2016, in accordance with which Lu Junfeng authorized the WFOE to act on his behalf as his exclusive agent with respect to all matters concerning his equity interest in CBMG Shanghai, including without limitation to attending the shareholder meetings of CBMG Shanghai, exercising voting rights and designating and appointing senior executives of CBMG Shanghai.
  
 Power of Attorney from Chen Mingzhe.  Through the WFOE we are the recipient of a power of attorney executed by Chen Mingzhe on October 26, 2016, in accordance with which Chen Mingzhe authorized the WFOE to act on his behalf as his exclusive agent with respect to all matters concerning his equity interest in CBMG Shanghai, including without limitation to attending the shareholders meetings of CBMG Shanghai, exercising voting rights and designating and appointing senior executives of CBMG Shanghai.
  
 Equity Interest Pledge Agreement with Lu Junfeng.  Through the WFOE, we are a party to an equity interest pledge agreement with CBMG Shanghai and Lu Junfeng dated October 26, 2016, in accordance with which: (i) Lu Junfeng pledged to the WFOE the entire equity interest he holds in CBMG Shanghai as security for payment of the consulting and service fees by CBMG Shanghai under the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement; (ii) Lu Junfeng and CBMG Shanghai submitted all necessary documents to ensure the registration of the Pledge of the Equity Interest with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”), and the pledge became effective on November 22, 2016; (iii) on the occurrence of any event of default, unless it has been successfully resolved within 20 days after the delivery of a rectification notice by the WFOE, the WFOE may exercise its pledge rights at any time by a written notice to Lu Junfeng.
  
 Equity Interest Pledge Agreement with Chen Mingzhe.   Through the WFOE we are a party to an equity interest pledge agreement with CBMG Shanghai and Chen Mingzhe dated October 26, 2016, in accordance with which: (i) Chen Mingzhe pledged to the WFOE the entire equity interest he holds in CBMG Shanghai as security for payment of the consulting and service fees by CBMG Shanghai under the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement; (ii) Chen Mingzhe and CBMG Shanghai submitted all necessary documents to ensure the registration of the Pledge of the Equity Interest with SAIC, and the pledge became effective on November 22, 2016; (iii) on the occurrence of any event of default, unless it has been successfully resolved within 20 days after the delivery of a rectification notice by the WFOE, the WFOE may exercise its pledge rights at any time by a written notice to Chen Mingzhe. 
  
 Our relationship with our controlled VIE entity, CBMG Shanghai, through the VIE agreements, is subject to various operational and legal risks.  Management believes that Mr. Chen and Mr. Lu, as record holders of the VIE’s registered capital, have no interest in acting contrary to the VIE agreements.  However, if Mr. Chen and Lu as shareholders of the VIE entity were to reduce or eliminate their ownership of the registered capital of the VIE entity, their interests may diverge from that of CBMG and they may seek to act in a manner contrary to the VIE agreements (for example by controlling the VIE entity in such a way that is inconsistent with the directives of CBMG management and the board; or causing non-payment by the VIE entity of services fees).  If such circumstances were to occur the WFOE would have to assert control rights through the powers of attorney and other VIE agreements, which would require legal action through the PRC judicial system.  While we believe the VIE agreements are legally enforceable in the PRC, there is a risk that enforcement of these agreements may involve more extensive procedures and costs to enforce, in comparison to direct equity ownership of the VIE entity.  We believe based on the advice of local counsel that the VIE agreements are valid and in compliance with PRC laws presently in effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the applicable PRC laws were to change or are interpreted by authorities in the future in a manner which challenges or renders the VIE agreements ineffective, the WFOE’s ability to control and obtain all benefits (economic or otherwise) of ownership of the VIE entity could be impaired or eliminated.   In the event of such future changes or new interpretations of PRC law, in an effort to substantially preserve our rights we may have to either amend our VIE agreements or enter into alternative arrangements which comply with PRC laws as interpreted and then in effect.

  BIOPHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS
  
 Our biopharmaceutical business was founded in 2009 as a newly formed specialty biomedicine company by a team of seasoned Chinese-American executives, scientists and doctors. In 2010, we established a facility designed and built to GMP standards in Wuxi, and in 2012 we established a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) GMP standard protocol-compliant manufacturing facility in Shanghai. In October 2015, we opened a facility designed and built to GMP standards in Beijing. In November 2017, we announced the grand opening of our Zhangjiang facility in Shanghai, of which 40,000 square feet was designed and built to GMP standards and dedicated to advanced cell manufacturing. Our focus has been to serve the rapidly growing health care market in China by marketing and commercializing stem cell and immune cell therapeutics, related tools and products from our patent-protected homegrown and acquired cell technology, as well as by utilizing exclusively in-licensed and other acquired intellectual properties.
  
 Our current treatment focal points are cancer and other degenerative diseases such as KOA.
  
 Cancer. In the cancer field, with the recent build-up of multiple cancer therapeutic technologies, we have prioritized our clinical efforts on CAR-T. We are not actively pursuing the fragmented Tcm technical services opportunities. On November 29, 2016, we announced the approval and commencement of patient enrollment in China for its CARD-1 (“CAR-T Against DLBCL”) Phase I clinical trial utilizing its optimized proprietary C-CAR011 construct of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy for the treatment of patients with refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). The CARD-1 trial has begun enrollment with final data expected to be available in the second half of 2018. On January 9, 2017 we announced the approval and commencement of patient enrollment in China for its CALL-1 (“CAR-T against Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia”) Phase I clinical trial utilizing its optimized proprietary C-CAR011 construct of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (“CAR-T”) therapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) CD19+ B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (“ALL”). The CALL-1 trial has begun enrollment with final data expected to be available in the second half of 2018. Depending on the Phase I CARD-1 and CALL-1 results, we expect to initiate larger trials to confirm the safety and efficacy profile and support BLA submission as soon as practicable.
  
 On May 15, 2017, we announced the addition of a new independent Phase I clinical trial of the Company’s ongoing CARD-1 study in patients with chemorefractory and aggressive DLBCL. Recruitment has started on patients comprised of DLBCL, Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) and Follicular Lymphoma (FL). Final data for this single arm, non-randomized study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of C- CAR011 (Anti-CD19 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) (41BB-CD3f)) therapy in relapsed or refractory B cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) is expected in the first half of 2019.
  
 KOA.  In 2013, we completed a Phase I/IIa clinical study, in China, for our Knee Osteoarthritis (“KOA”) therapy named Re-Join®. The trial tested the safety and efficacy of intra-articular injections of autologous haMPCs in order to reduce inflammation and repair damaged joint cartilage. The 6-month follow-up clinical data showed Re-Join® therapy to be both safe and effective.
  
 In Q2 of 2014, we completed patient enrollment for the Phase IIb clinical trial of Re-Join® for KOA. The multi-center study enrolled 53 patients to participate in a randomized, single blind trial. We published 48 weeks follow-up data of Phase I/IIa on December 5, 2014.  The 48 week data indicated that patients have reported a decrease in pain and a significant improvement in mobility and flexibility, while the clinical data shows our Re-Join® regenerative medicine treatment to be safe.   We announced the interim 24 week results for Re-Join® on March 25, 2015 and  released positive Phase IIb 48 week follow-up data in January 2016, which shows the primary and secondary endpoints of Re-Join® therapy group having all improved significantly compared to their baseline, which has confirmed some of the Company’s Phase I/IIa results. Our Re-Join® human adipose-derived mesenchymal progenitor cell (haMPC) therapy for KOA is an interventional therapy using proprietary device, process, culture and medium:
  
   ●
 Obtain  adipose (fat) tissue from the patient using our CFDA approved medical device, the A-Stromal™ Kit;

   ●
 Expand haMPCs using our proprietary culture medium (serum-free and antibiotics-free); and

   ●
 Formulated for ReJoin therapy using our proprietary formulation.

 
 Our process is distinguishable from sole Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) therapy. The immunophenotype of our haMPCs exhibited multiple biomarkers such as CD29+, CD73+, CD90+, CD49d+, HLA-I+, HLA-DR-, Actin-, CD14-, CD34-, and CD45-.  In contrast, SVF is merely a heterogeneous fraction including preadipocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs).

 In January 2016, we launched the Allogeneic KOA Phase I Trial in China to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AlloJoin™, an off-the shelf allogeneic adipose derived progenitor cell (haMPC) therapy for the treatment of KOA. On August 5, 2016 we completed patient treatment for the Allogeneic KOA Phase I trial, and on December 9, 2016 we announced interim 3-month safety data from the Allogenic KOA Phase I Trial in China. The interim analysis of the trial has preliminarily demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile of AlloJoin™ in the three doses tested, and no serious adverse events (SAE) have been observed. The trial has been completed in 2017.
  
 In January 2015, we initiated patient recruitment in a phase II clinical study, in China, of ReJoin (human adipose derived mesenchymal progenitor cell or “haMPC”) in Cartilage Damaged (“CD”) patients resulting from osteoarthritis (“OA”) or sports injury, in further support of KOA indication. The study is based on the same technology that has shown significant efficacy in the treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis (“KOA”), but requires two arthroscopic examinations and the use of magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) to further demonstrate the regenerative efficacy of ReJoin. Upon further review of the protocol and the difficulty of getting patients back for a second arthroscopic examination, we determined to terminate the study.
  
 The unique lines of adult adipose-derived stem cells and the immune cell therapies enable us to create multiple cell formulations in treating specific medical conditions and diseases, as well as applying single cell types in a specific treatment protocol. The quality management systems of CBMG Shanghai and CBMG Wuxi were issued a Certificate of ISO-9001:2008 by SGS /ANAB (ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board). Our facility in Shanghai was issued a Certificate of Compliance by ENV Services, Inc., an ISO Inspection Service Provider that (i) its rooms 1-7, 10 are certified to ISO Class 7 per ISO-14644 in accordance with cGMP; (ii) its biological safety cabinets are certified per NSF/ANSI 49 and to ISO Class 5;and (iii) its instrumentation calibration has been certified to perform in accordance with ANSI/NCSL Z-540-1 and document in accordance with 10CFR21.Our facility in Shanghai was issued a Testing Report by Shanghai Food and Drug Packaging Material Control Center concluding that some testing items of the cleanrooms are in compliance with the Good Manufacturing Practice for Drugs (2010 Revision) of China. The cleanrooms in Beijing are certified to meet the standard of CNAS L1669; and Wuxi has been certified to meet the SHPMCC standard.
  
 In addition to standard protocols, we use proprietary processes and procedures for manufacturing our cell lines, comprised of:
  
  ●
  Banking processes that ensure cell preservation and viability;

  ●
 DNA identification for stem cell ownership; and

  ●
  Bio-safety testing at independently certified laboratories.

 Recent Developments in Cancer Cell Therapy  
  According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute’s 2013 cancer topics research update on CAR-T-Cells, excitement is growing for immunotherapy—therapies that harness the power of a patient’s immune system to combat their disease, or what some in the research community are calling the “fifth pillar” of cancer treatment.
  
 One approach to immunotherapy involves engineering patients’ own immune cells to recognize and attack their tumors. And although this approach, called adoptive cell transfer (ACT), has been restricted to small clinical trials so far, treatments using these engineered immune cells have generated some remarkable responses in patients with advanced cancer. For example, in several early-stage trials testing ACT in patients with ALL who had few if any remaining treatment options, many patients’ cancers have disappeared entirely. Several of these patients have remained cancer free for extended periods.

 
 Equally promising results have been reported in several small clinical trials involving patients with lymphoma. Although the lead investigators cautioned that much more research is needed, the results from the trials performed thus far indicate that researchers can successfully alter patients’ T cells so that they attack their cancer cells.  As an example, we look to Spectrum Pharmaceutical’s Folotyn approved in September 2009 for treatment of R/R peripheral T-cell lymphoma with approval supported by a single arm trial observing an overall response rate of 27% and median duration of response of 9.4 months. In addition, CTI Therapeutics Pixuvri received a complete response letter in April 2010 in R/R aggressive NHL in which a 37% overall response rate and 5.5 month duration of response was observed.
  
 ACT’s building blocks are T cells, a type of immune cell collected from the patient’s own blood. After collection, the T cells are genetically engineered to produce special receptors on their surface called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). CARs are proteins that allow the T cells to recognize a specific protein (antigen) on tumor cells. These engineered CAR T cells are then grown in the laboratory until they number in the billions. The expanded population of CAR T cells is then infused into the patient. After the infusion, if all goes as planned, the T cells multiply in the patient’s body and, with guidance from their engineered receptor, recognize and kill cancer cells that harbor the antigen on their surfaces. This process builds on a similar form of ACT pioneered from NCI’s Surgery Branch for patients with advanced melanoma. According to www.cancer.gov/.../research-updates/2013/CAR-T-Cells, in 2013 NCI’s Pediatric Oncology Branch commented that the CAR T cells are much more potent than anything they can achieve with other immune-based treatments being studied. Although investigators working in this field caution that there is still much to learn about CAR T-cell therapy, the early results from trials like these have generated considerable optimism. Researchers opined that CAR T-cell therapy eventually may become a standard therapy for some B-cell malignancies like ALL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
  
 So far, chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy such as CD19 CAR-T, have been tested in several hematological indications on patients that are refractory/relapsing to chemotherapy, and many of them have relapsed after stem cell transplantation.  All of these patients had very limited treatment option prior to CAR-T therapy.  CAR-T has shown positive clinical efficacy in many of these patients. Some of have them lived for years post CAR-T treatment.
  
 Management believes the remaining risk in monetizing cancer immune cell therapies is concentrated in late stage clinical studies, speed-to-approval, manufacturing and process optimization.
  
 On July 2016, Juno Therapeutics, Inc. reported the death of patients enrolled in the U.S. Phase II clinical trial of JCAR015 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The US FDA put the trial on hold and lifted the hold within a week after Juno provided satisfactory explanation and solution. Juno believes that the patient deaths were caused by the use of Fludarabine preconditioning and they will use only cyclophosphamide pre-conditioning in the future enrollment. The trial was halted in November of 2016 after two more deaths occurred after the trial resumed. The Company believes that its product and study are distinguishable from Juno Therapeutics and plans to continue to monitor any toxicities associated with the study.
  
 On August 2017, the U.S. FDA approved Novartis’ CAR-T therapy on relapsed or refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common cancer in Children. Current treatments show a rate of 80% remission using intensive chemotherapy. However, there are almost no conventional treatments to help patients who have relapsed. Novartis’ Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah), a CD19-targeted CAR-T therapy for children and adolescents with r/r ALL has shown results of complete and long lasting remission, which led the FDA to approve the drug funded by Novartis and the first CAR-T therapy.
  
 On October 2017, the U.S. FDA approved Kite Pharmaceuticals’ (Gilead) CAR-T therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common type of non- Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in adults. The initial results of axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta), Kite Pharma’s drug for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, shows four out of seven patients treated achieved complete remission, which continued after 12 months. The prognosis of high-grade chemo refractory NHL is dismal with a medium survival time of a few weeks. Yescarta is a therapy for patients who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two other kinds of treatment.
  
 In December 2017, the Chinese government issued trial guidelines concerning development and testing of cell therapy products in China. Although these trial guidelines are not yet codified as mandatory regulation, we believe they provide a measure of clarity and a preliminary regulatory pathway for our cell therapy operations in a still uncertain regulatory environment.

 Market for Cell-Based Therapies
  
 In 2013, U.S. sales of products which contain stem cells or progenitor cells or which are used to concentrate autologous blood, bone marrow or adipose tissues to yield concentrations of stem cells for therapeutic use were, conservatively, valued at $236 million at the hospital level. It is estimated that the orthopedics industry used approximately 92% of the stem cell products.
  
 The forecast is that in the United States, shipments of treatments with stem cells or instruments which concentrate stem cell preparations for injection into painful joints will fuel an overall increase in the use of stem cell based treatments and an increase to $5.7 billion in 2020, with key growth areas being Spinal Fusion, Sports Medicine and Osteoarthritis of the joints. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prevalence of doctor-diagnosed arthritis and arthritis-attributable activity limitation United States. 2010-2012, Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease that is characterized by degeneration of the articular cartilage, hyperosteogeny, and ultimately, joint destruction that can affect all of the joints. According to Dillon CF, Rasch EK, Gu Q et al. Prevalence of knee osteoarthritis in the United States: Arthritis Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1991-94. J Rheumatol. 2006, the incidence of OA is 50% among people over age 60 and 90% among people over age 65. KOA accounts for the majority of total OA conditions and in adults, OA is the second leading cause of work disability and the disability incidence is high (53%). The costs of OA management have grown exponentially over recent decades, accounting for up to 1% to 2.5% of the gross national product of countries with aging populations, including the U.S., Canada, the UK, France, and Australia. According to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS), the only pharmacologic therapies recommended for OA symptom management are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and tramadol (for patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis). Moreover, there is no approved disease modification therapy for OA in the world. Disease progression is a leading cause of hospitalization and ultimately requires joint replacement surgery. In 2009, the U.S. spent over $42 billion on replacement surgery for hip and knee joints alone. International regulatory guidelines on clinical investigation of medicinal products used in the treatment of OA were updated in 2015, and clinical benefits (or trial outcomes) of a disease modification therapy for KOA has been well defined and recommended. Medicinal products used in the treatment of osteoarthritis need to provide both a symptom relief effect for at least 6 months and a structure modification effect to slow cartilage degradation by at least 12 months. Symptom relief is generally measured by a composite questionnaire Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and structure modification is measured by MRI, or radiographic image as accepted by international communities. The Company uses the WOMAC as primary end point to demonstrate symptom relief, and MRI to assess structure and regeneration benefits as a secondary endpoint.
  
 According to the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, there are 27 million Americans with Osteoarthritis (OA), and symptomatic Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) occurs in 13% of persons aged 60 and older. The International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases, 2011 reports that approximately 57 million people in China suffer from KOA. Currently no treatment exists that can effectively preserve knee joint cartilage or slow the progression of KOA. Current common drug-based methods of management, including anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), only relieve symptoms and carry the risk of side effects. Patients with KOA suffer from compromised mobility, leading to sedentary lifestyles; doubling the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and obesity; and increasing the risk of all causes of mortality, colon cancer, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, lipid disorders, depression and anxiety. According to the Epidemiology of Rheumatic Disease (Silman AJ, Hochberg MC. Oxford Univ. Press, 1993:257), 53% of patients with KOA will eventually become disabled.
     The number of cell therapy companies that are currently in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials has been gathering momentum, and we anticipate that new cellular therapy products will appear on the market within the next several years.

 Our Strategy
 
 The majority of our biopharmaceutical business is in the development stage. We intend to concentrate our business on cell therapies and in the near-term, carrying our KOA stem cell therapy and cancer immune cell therapies to commercialization.
  
 We are developing our business in cell therapeutics and capitalizing on the increasing importance and promise that adult stem cells have in regenerative medicine. Our most advanced candidate involves adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells to treat KOA. Based on current estimates, we expect our biopharmaceutical business to generate revenues primarily through the development of therapies for the treatment of KOA within the next three to four years.
  
 Presently we have two completed KOA cell therapy clinical studies in China, a Phase IIb autologous study and a Phase I allogeneic study. If and when either therapy obtains regulatory approval in the PRC, we will be able to market and offer the therapy for clinical use in China.
  
 Our strategy is to develop safe and effective cellular medicine therapies for indications that represent a large unmet need in China, based on technologies developed both in-house and obtained through acquisition, licensing and collaboration arrangements with other companies. Our near term objective is to pursue successful clinical trials in China for our KOA application.  We intend to utilize our comprehensive cell platform to support multiple cell lines to pursue multiple therapies, both allogeneic and autologous. We intend to apply U.S. Standard Operating Procedures ("SOPs") and protocols while complying with Chinese regulations, while owning, developing and executing our own clinical trial protocols. We plan to establish domestic and international joint ventures or partnerships to set up cell laboratories and/or research facilities, acquire technology or in-license technology from outside of China, and build affiliations with hospitals, to develop a commercialization path for our therapies, once approved. We intend to use our first-mover advantage in China, against a backdrop of enhanced regulation by the central government, to differentiate ourselves from the competition and establish a leading position in the China cell therapeutic market.  We also intend to out-license our technologies to interested parties and are exploring the feasibility of a U.S. allogeneic KOA clinical study with the FDA.
 
 With the AG acquisition we intend to monetize AG’s U.S. and Chinese intellectual property for immune cell therapy preparation methodologies and patient immunity assessment by engaging with prominent hospitals to conduct pre-clinical and clinical studies in specific cancer indications. The T Cell clonality analysis technology patent, together with AG’s other know-how for immunity analysis, will enable the Company to establish an immunoassay platform that is crucial for immunity evaluation of patients with immune disorders as well as cancerous diseases that are undergoing therapy. We will continue to seek to empower hospitals' immune cell cancer therapy development programs that help patients improve their quality of life and improve their survival rate.
  
 We believe that few competitors in China are as well-equipped as we are in the clinical trial development, diversified U.S. FDA protocol compliant manufacturing facilities, regulatory compliance and policy making participation, as well as a long-term presence in the U.S. with U.S.-based management and investor base.
  
 We intend to continue our business development efforts by adding other proven domestic and international biotechnology partners to monetize the China health care market.
      In order to expedite fulfillment of patient treatment CBMG has been actively developing technologies and products with a strong intellectual properties protection, including haMPC, derived from fat tissue, for the treatment of KOA and other indications. CBMG’s acquisition of AG provides an enlarged opportunity to expand the application of its cancer therapy-enabling technologies and to initiate clinical trials with leading cancer hospitals. 
  
 CBMG's proprietary and patent-protected production processes and clinical protocols enable us to produce raw material, manufacture cells, and conduct cell banking and distribution. These protocols include medical assessment to qualify each patient for treatment, evaluation of each patient before and after a specific therapy, cell transplantation methodologies including dosage, frequency and the use of adjunct therapies, potential adverse effects and their proper management. Applying our proprietary intellectual property, we will be able to customize specialize formulations to address complex diseases and debilitating conditions.

   
   
15



 
 
 We operate our manufacturing facilities under the design of the standard good manufacturing practice ("GMP") conditions in the ISO accredited laboratories standard. We employ an institutionalized and proprietary process and quality management system to optimize reproducibility and to hone our efficiency. Three facilities designed and built to GMP in Beijing, Shanghai and Wuxi, China meet international standards. With our integrated Plasmid, Viral Vectors, and CAR-T cells Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls processes as well as planned capacity expansion, we are highly distinguishable with other companies in the cellular medicine space.
  
 In total, our facilities have approximately 70,000 square feet of space and are expected to have a capacity to provide therapies that can treat approximately 10,000 cancer patients and 10,000 patients per year.
  
 Most importantly, our most experienced team members have more than 20 years of relevant experience in China, European Union, and the United States. All of these factors make CBMG a high quality cell products manufacturer in China.
  
 Our Targeted Indications and Potential Therapies
  
  Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA)
  
 We are currently pursuing two primary therapies for the treatment of KOA: our Re-Join® therapy and our AlloJoinTM therapy.
  
 We completed the Phase I/IIa clinical trial for the treatment of KOA. The trial tested the safety and efficacy of intra-articular injections of autologous haMPCs in order to reduce inflammation and repair damaged joint cartilage. The 6-month follow-up clinical data showed Re-Join® therapy to be both safe and effective.
  
 In the second quarter of 2014, we completed patient enrollment for the Phase IIb clinical trial of Re-Join® for KOA. The multi-center study has enrolled 53 patients to participate in a randomized, single blind trial. We published 48 weeks follow-up data of Phase I/IIa on December 5, 2014.  The 48 weeks data indicated that patients have reported a decrease in pain and a significant improvement in mobility and flexibility, while the clinical data shows our Re-Join® regenerative medicine treatment to be safe. We announced positive Phase IIb 48-week follow-up data in January 2016, with statistical significant evidence that Re-Join® enhanced cartilage regeneration, which concluded the planned phase IIb trial.
  
   
16



 
 
 In January 2016, we launched the Allogeneic KOA Phase I Trial in China to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AlloJoin™, an off-the shelf haMPC therapy for the treatment of KOA. On August 5, 2016 we completed patient treatment for the Allogeneic KOA Phase I trial. On August 5, 2016 we completed patient treatment for the Allogenic KOA Phase I Trial, and on December 9, 2016, we announced interim 3-month safety data from the Allogenic KOA Phase I Trial in China. The interim analysis of the trial has preliminarily demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile of AlloJoin™ in the three doses tested, and no SAEs have been observed. The trial has been completed in 2017.  We plan to release the data in the second quarter of 2018.
  
 Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease of the joints. KOA is one of the most common types of osteoarthritis. Pathological manifestation of osteoarthritis is primarily local inflammation caused by immune response and subsequent damage of joints. Restoration of immune response and joint tissues are the objective of therapies.
  
 According to International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases, 2011, 53% of KOA patients will degenerate to the point of disability. Conventional treatment usually involves invasive surgery with painful recovery and physical therapy. As drug-based methods of management are ineffective, the same journal estimates that some 1.5 million patients with this disability will degenerate to the point of requiring artificial joint replacement surgery every year. However, only 40,000 patients will actually be able to undergo replacement surgery, leaving the majority of patients to suffer from a life-long disability due to lack of effective treatment.
  
  Adult mesenchymal stem cells can currently be isolated from a variety of adult human sources, such as liver, bone marrow, and adipose (fat) tissue. We believe the advantages in using adipose tissue (as opposed to bone marrow or blood) are that it is one of the richest sources of pluripotent cells in the body, the easy and repeatable access to fat via liposuction, and the simple cell isolation procedures that can begin to take place even on-site with minor equipment needs. The procedure we are testing for KOA involves extracting a very small amount of fat using a minimally invasive extraction process which takes up to 20 minutes, and leaves no scarring. The haMPC cells are then processed and isolated on site, and injected intra articularly into the knee joint with ultrasound guidance.
 
 These haMPC cells are capable of differentiating into bone, cartilage, tendon, skeletal muscle, and fat under the right conditions. As such, haMPCs are an attractive focus for medical research and clinical development. Importantly, we believe both allogeneic and autologously sourced haMPCs may be used in the treatment of disease. Numerous studies have provided preclinical data that support the safety and efficacy of allogeneic and autologously derived haMPC, offering a choice for those where factors such as donor age and health are an issue.
  
 Additionally, certain disease treatment plans call for an initial infusion of these cells in the form of SVF, an initial form of cell isolation that can be completed and injected within ninety minutes of receiving lipoaspirate. The therapeutic potential conferred by the cocktail of ingredients present in the SVF is also evident, as it is a rich source for preadipocytes, mesenchymal stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells, T regulatory cells and anti-inflammatory macrophages.
  
 haMPCs are currently being considered as a new and effective treatment for osteoarthritis, with a huge potential market.  Osteoarthritis is one of the ten most disabling diseases in developed countries. Worldwide estimates are that 9.6% of men and 18.0% of women aged over 60 years have symptomatic osteoarthritis. It is estimated that the global OA therapeutics market was worth $4.4 billion in 2010 and is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3.8% to reach $5.9 billion by 2018.
 
 In order to bring haMPC-based KOA therapy to market, our market strategy is to: (a) establish regional laboratories that comply with cGMP standards in Shanghai and Beijing that meet Chinese regulatory approval; and (b) file joint applications with Class AAA hospitals to use haMPCs to treat KOA in a clinical trial setting.
  
 Our competitors are pursuing treatments for osteoarthritis with knee cartilage implants.  However, unlike their approach, our KOA therapy is not surgically invasive – it uses a small amount (30ml) of adipose tissue obtained via liposuction from the patient, which is cultured and re-injected into the patient. The injections are designed to induce the body’s secretion of growth factors promoting immune response and regulation, and regrowth of cartilage. The down-regulation of the patient’s immune response is aimed at reducing and controlling inflammation which is a central cause of KOA.
  
 We believe our proprietary method, subsequent haMPC proliferation and processing know-how will enable haMPC therapy to be a low cost and relatively safe and effective treatment for KOA. Additionally, banked haMPCs can continue to be stored for additional use in the future.
  
  Immuno-oncology (I/o)
  
 We continue to fortify our cancer breakthrough technology platform with I/o, programmed cell death and vaccine technology.
  
 Our CAR-T platform is built on lenti-virial vector and second-generation CAR design, which is used by most of the current trials and studies. We rigorously select the patient population for each asset and indication to allow the optimal path forward for regulatory approval. We also fully integrate the state of art translational medicine effort into each clinical study to aid in dose selection, to confirm the mechanism of action and proof of concept, and to identify the optimal targeting patient population whenever appropriate. We plan to continue to grow our translational medicine team and engage key opinion leaders to meet the demand.
  
   
17



 
 
 Solid tumors pose more challenges than hematological cancers.  The patients are more heterogeneous, making it difficult to have one drug to work effectively in the majority of the patients in any cancer indication.  The duration of response is most likely shorter and patients are likely to relapse even after initial positive clinical response.  We will continue our effort in developing cell based therapies to target both hematological cancers and solid tumors.
   
  Tumor Cell Specific Dendritic Cells (TC-DC)
  
 Recent scientific findings indicate the presence of special cells in tumors that are responsible for cancer metastases and relapse. Referred to as “cancer stem cells”, these cells make up only a small portion of the tumor mass. The central concept behind TC-DC therapy is to immunize against these cells. TC-DC therapy takes a sample of the patient’s own purified and irradiated cancer cells and combines them with specialized immune cells, thereby ‘educating’ the immune cells to destroy the cancer stem cells from which tumors arise.  We believe the selective targeting of cells that drive tumor growth would allow for effective cancer treatment without the risks and side effects of current therapies that also destroy healthy cells in the body.
  
 Our strategy is, through the acquisition of AG and the technologies and pre-clinical and clinical data of University of the South Florida and PLAGH, to become an immune cell business leader in the China cancer therapy market and specialty pharmaceutical market by utilizing CBMG’s attractiveness as a Nasdaq listed company to consolidate key China immune cell technology leaders with fortified intellectual property and ramp up revenue with first mover’s advantage in a safe and efficient manner.  The Company plans to accelerate cancer trials in China by using the knowledge and experience gained from the Company’s ongoing KOA trials and the recent, CAR-T and Tcm technologies. However, it remains unclear if any of our clinical trials will qualify for U.S.FDA-liked Fast Track designation as maintenance therapy in subjects with advanced cancer who have limited options following surgery and front-line platinum/taxane chemotherapy to improve their progression-free survival. By applying U.S. SOP and protocols and following authorized treatment plans in China, we believe we are differentiated from our competition as we believe we have first mover’s advantage and a fortified barrier to entry.  In addition, encouraged by the 2017 CIRM grant of $2.29 million for our preclinical trial to replicate and validate the manufacturing process and control system at the cGMP facility located at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles to support the filing of an IND with the FDA, we have begun to review the feasibility of performing synergistic U.S. KOA clinical trial.

We are scaling up and expanding our manufacturing capacity to treat up to 10,000 CAR-T and 10,000 KOA patients per year when our facilities are fully operational by end of 2018. Our facilities are operated by a manufacturing and technology team with decades of relevant experience in China, EU, and the U.S.
  
 In any precision setting, it is vital that all controlled environment equipment meet certain design standards. We operate our manufacturing facilities under good manufacturing practice ("GMP") conditions in the ISO accredited laboratories standard. We employ an institutionalized and proprietary process and quality management system to optimize reproducibility and to hone our efficiency. Three of our facilities designed and built to GMP in Beijing, Shanghai and Wuxi, China meet international standards. Specifically, our Shanghai cleanroom facility underwent rigorous cleanroom certification since 2013. Our facility in Shanghai was issued a Certificate of Compliance by ENV Services, Inc., an ISO Inspection Service Provider, that (i) its rooms 1-7, 10 are certified to ISO Class 7 per ISO-14644 in accordance with cGMP. (ii) its biological safety cabinets are certified per NSF/ANSI 49 and to ISO Class 5. and (iii) its instrumentation calibration has been certified to perform in accordance with ANSI/NCSL Z-540-1 and document in accordance with 10CFR21. The cleanrooms in Beijing are certified to meet the standard of CNAS L1669 and our Wuxi facility has been certified to meet the SHPMCC standard. With our integrated Plasmid, Viral Vectors, and CAR-T cells Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls processes as well as planned capacity expansion, we believe that are highly distinguishable with other companies in the cellular medicine space. 
  
 In January 2017, we leased a 113,038-square foot building located in the “Pharma Valley” of Shanghai, the People’s Republic of China. We are establishing 43,000 square foot facilities there with 25 clean-rooms and equipped with 12 independent production lines to support clinical batch production and commercial scale manufacturing. With above expansion, the Company could support up to 10,000 patients with CAR-T therapy and 10,000 KOA patients with the stem cell therapy per annum.
  
 We have built cell preparation and inspection laboratories that enable the following mode of human body immune cell in-vitro culture service to be provided: make cell preparation for human body venous blood samples, after completion of the cell preparation, deliver the immune cell agents to the customer; and provide immune function evaluation for the patients in Jilin and several other hospitals in China.
  
 Competition
  
 Many companies operate in the cellular biopharmaceutical field.  In 2010, the FDA approved the first cell therapy for Dendreon Corporation to apply an autologous cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of a certain type of prostate cancer. In May 2012 the Canadian authorities approved the first stem cell drug and granted Osiris Therapeutics’ manufactured stem cell product for use in the pediatric graft-versus-host disease. To date there are over thirty publicly listed and several private cellular biopharmaceutical focused companies outside of China with varying phases of clinical trials addressing a variety of diseases. We compete with these companies in bringing cellular therapies to the market.  However, our focus is to develop a core business in the China market. This difference in focus places us in a different competitive environment from other western companies with respect to fund raising, clinical trials, collaborative partnerships, and the markets in which we compete.

 The PRC central government has a focused strategy to enable China to compete effectively in certain designated areas of biotechnology and the health sciences. Because of the aging population in China, China’s Ministry of Science and Technology (“MOST”) has targeted stem cell development as high priority field, and development in this field has been intense in the agencies under MOST. For example, the 973 Program has funded a number of stem cell research projects such as differentiation of human embryonic germ cells and the plasticity of adult stem cells. Notwithstanding such governmental support, China has had a highly fragmented cellular medicine landscape.  Shenzhen Beike Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (“Beike”) and Union Stem Cell & Gene Engineering Co., Ltd. (“Union Stem Cell”) are two large stem cell companies in China. To the best of our knowledge, none of the Chinese companies are utilizing our proposed international manufacturing protocol and our unique technologies in conducting what we believe will be fully compliant CFDA-sanctioned clinical trials to commercialize cell therapies in China.  Our management believes that it is difficult for most of these Chinese companies to turn their results into translational stem cell science or commercially successful therapeutic products using internationally acceptable standards.
  
 We compete globally with respect to the discovery and development of new cell based therapies, and we also compete within China to bring new therapies to market.  The biotechnology industry, namely in the areas of cell processing and manufacturing, clinical development of cellular therapies and cell collection, processing and storage, are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition.  Our competitors worldwide include pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and government agencies engaged in drug discovery activities or funding, in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Many of these companies are well-established and possess technical, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many of our smaller potential competitors have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that afford these companies potential research and development and commercialization advantages in the technology and therapeutic areas currently being pursued by us.  Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce products directly competitive to those being commercialized by us. Moreover, many of these competitors may be able to obtain patent protection, obtain government (e.g. FDA) and other regulatory approvals and begin commercial sales of their products before us.
 
 Our primary competitors in the field of stem cell therapy for osteoarthritis, and other indications include Beike, Cytori Therapeutics Inc., Caladrius Biosciences, Inc. and others.  Among our competitors, to our knowledge, the only ones based in and operating in Greater China are Beike, Lorem Vascular, which has partnered with Cytori to commercialize Cytori Cell Therapy for the cardiovascular, renal and diabetes markets in China and Hong Kong, and OLife Bio, a Medi-Post joint venture with JingYuan Bio in Taian, Shandong Province, who plans to initiate clinical trial in China in 2016.  Our primary competitors in the field of cancer immune cell therapies include pharmaceutical, biotechnology companies such as Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc., Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Kite Pharma, Inc., CARSgen, Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. and others.  Among our competitors, the ones based in and operating in Greater China are BeiGene, Limited, CARsgen and China Oncology Focus Limited, which has licensed Sorrento’s anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody for Greater China. Other western big pharma and biotech companies in the cancer immune cell therapies space are starting to make inroads into China by partnering or seeking to partner with local companies. For example, in April, 2016, Seattle-based Juno Therapeutics, Inc started a new company with WuXi AppTec in China named JW Biotechnology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. Its mission is to build China's leading cell therapy company by leveraging Juno's chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR) technologies together with WuXi AppTec's R&D and manufacturing platform and local expertise to develop novel cell-based immunotherapies for patients with hematologic and solid organ cancers. In January 2017, Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical created a joint venture with Santa Monica-based Kite Pharma Inc. to develop, manufacture and commercialize axicabtagene ciloleucel in China with the option to include additional products, including two T cell receptor (TCR) product candidates from Kite. Axicabtagene ciloleucel is Kite's lead product candidate and is an investigational chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy under development for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. In late 2017 Gilead acquired Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion. On January 22, 2018 Celgene announced that it had agreed to buy Juno Therapeutics for approximately $9 billion.
 
 The CFDA has received six applications for CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells cancer therapies from different companies. The applicants are Nanjing Legend biotechnology, Chengdu Yinhe Biological medicine, Shanghai HRAIN Biotechnology, Carsgene Biomedicine (Shanghai), Biogene ANKE Cell Technology and Shanghai Mingju Biotechnology.

 Additionally, in the general area of cell-based therapies for knee osteoarthritis ailments, we potentially compete with a variety of companies, from big pharma to specialty medical products or biotechnology companies. Some of these, such as Abbvie, Merck KGaA, Sanofi, Teva, GlaxosmithKline, Baxter, Johnson & Johnson, Sanumed, Medtronic and Miltenyi Biotec, are well-established and have substantial technical and financial resources compared to ours.  However, as cell-based products are only just emerging as viable medical therapies, many of our more direct competitors are smaller biotechnology and specialty medical products companies comprised of Vericel Corporation, Regeneus Ltd., Advanced Cell Technology, Inc., Nuo Therapeutics, Inc., Arteriocyte Medical Systems, Inc., ISTO technologies, Inc., Ember Therapeutics, Athersys, Inc., Bioheart, Inc., Cytori Therapeutics, Inc., Harvest Technologies Corporation, Mesoblast, Pluristem, Inc., TissueGene, Inc. Medipost Co. Ltd. and others. There are also several non cell-based, small molecule and peptide clinical trials targeting knee osteoarthritis, and several other FDA approved treatment for knee pain.
  
 Some of our competitors also work with adipose-derived stem cells.  To the best of our knowledge, none of these companies are currently utilizing the same technologies as ours to treat KOA, nor to our knowledge are any of these companies conducting government-approved clinical trials in China.
  
 Some of our targeted disease applications may compete with drugs from traditional pharmaceutical or Traditional Chinese Medicine companies. We believe that our chosen targeted disease applications are not effectively in competition with the products and therapies offered by traditional pharmaceutical or Traditional Chinese Medicine companies.
  
 We believe we have a strategic advantage over our competitors based on our ability to meet cGMP regulatory requirements, a capability which we believe is possessed by few to none of our competitors in China, in an industry in which meeting exacting standards and achieving extremely high purity levels is crucial to success.  In addition, in comparison to the broader range of cellar biopharmaceutical firms, we believe we have the advantages of cost and expediency, and a first mover advantage with respect to commercialization of cell therapy products and treatments in the Greater China market.
  
 Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2017, the total enrollment of full time employees of CBMG is 125. Among these 125 professionals, 20 have PhD degrees, 54 have postgraduate degrees and 42 have undergraduate degrees.  In other words, 93% of our employees are well qualified professionals. As a biotech company, 93 out of our 125 employees have medical or biological scientific credentials and qualifications.
Facilities
  
 Our corporate headquarters are located at 19925 Stevens Creek Blvd., Suite 100 in Cupertino, California. We currently pay rent for a total of $268,000 per month for an aggregate of approximately 177,000 square feet of space to house our administration, research and manufacturing facilities in Maryland and in the cities of Wuxi, Beijing and Shanghai in China.
Certain Tax Matters
  
 Following the completion of our merger with EastBridge Investment Group Corporation (Delaware) on February 6, 2013, CBMG and its controlled subsidiaries (the “CBMG Entities”) became a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) under U.S. Internal Revenue Code Section 957. As a result, the CBMG Entities are subject to anti-deferral provisions within the U.S. federal income tax system that were designed to limit deferral of taxable earnings otherwise achieved by putting profit in low taxed offshore entities. While the CBMG Entities are subject to review under such provisions, the CBMG Entities’ earnings are from an active business and should not be deemed to be distributions made to its U.S. parent company.
  
 On December 22, 2017, the tax reform bill was passed (Tax Cut and Jobs Act (H.R.1)) and reduced top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective from January 1, 2018. Pursuant to this new Act, non-operating loss carry back period is eliminated and the loss carry forward period was expanded from 20 years to an indefinite period.

 Pursuant to the Corporate Income Tax Law of the PRC, all of the Company’s PRC subsidiaries are liable to PRC CIT at a rate of 25% except for Cellular Biomedicine Group Ltd. (Shanghai) (“CBMG Shanghai”). According to Guoshuihan 2009 No. 203, if an entity is certified as an “advanced and new technology enterprise”, it is entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 15%. CBMG Shanghai obtained the certificate of “advanced and new technology enterprise” dated October 30, 2015 with an effective period of three years and the provision for PRC corporate income tax for CBMG Shanghai is calculated by applying the income tax rate of 15% in 2017 (2016: 15%; 2015: 15%).
  
 BIOPHARMACEUTICAL REGULATION
  
 PRC Regulations
  
 Our cellular medicine business operates in a highly regulated environment.  In China, aside from provincial and local licensing authorities, hospitals and their internal ethics and utilization committees, and a system of institutional review boards (“IRBs”) which in many cases have members appointed by provincial authorities. With respect to cell therapies, however, the Chinese regulatory infrastructure is less established and China has not yet codified any mandatory regulations governing the development of cell therapy products. In December 2017, the Chinese government issued trial guidelines concerning development and testing of cell therapy products, including stem cell treatments and immune cell therapies such as CAR-T cell therapeutics. These trial guidelines are not mandatory regulation but provide some general principles and basic requirements for cell therapy products in the areas of pharmaceutical research, non-clinical research and clinical research. The cell therapy products provided in the trial guideline refer to the human-sourced living cell products which are used for human disease therapy, whose source, operation and clinical trial process are in line with ethics and whose research and registration application are in line with regulations on pharmaceutical administration. The competent authority of pharmaceutical administration is the CFDA. It is further clarified by the CFDA that the non-registered clinical trial data would be acceptable for drug registration on a case by case basis, pending on the consistency of the samples used for the clinical trial and the drug applied for registration, the generation process of the clinical trial data, whether the data is authentic, complete, accurate and traceable to the source, and the inspection outcome of the CFDA on the clinical trial. Moreover, an applicant of the clinical trial of the said cell therapyproducts can propose the phases of the clinical trial and the trial plan by itself (generally the trial can be divided into early stage clinical trial phase and confirmatory clinical trial phase), instead of the application of the traditional phases I, II and III of a clinical trial. However, it remains unclear if any of our clinical trials will be offered U.S.FDA-like Fast Track designation as maintenance therapy in subjects with advanced cancer who have limited options following surgery and front-line platinum/taxane chemotherapy to improve their progression-free survival. By applying U.S. standards and protocols and following authorized treatment plans in China, we believe we are differentiated from our competition as we believe we have first mover’s advantage in an undeveloped industry.  In addition, we have begun to review the feasibility of performing synergistic U.S. clinical studies.
 PRC Operating Licenses
  
 Our business operations in China are subject to customary regulation and licensing requirements under regulatory agencies including the local Administration for Industry and Commerce, General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, and the State Administration of Taxation, for each of our business locations. Additionally, our clean room facilities and the use of reagents is also regulated by local branches of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. We are in good standing with respect to each of our business operating licenses.
U.S. Government Regulation
  
 The health care industry is one of the most highly regulated industries in the United States. The federal government, individual state and local governments, as well as private accreditation organizations, oversee and monitor the activities of individuals and businesses engaged in the development, manufacture and delivery of health care products and services. Federal laws and regulations seek to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the United States, as well as to prevent fraud and abuse associated with the purchase of health care products and services with federal monies. The relevant state and local laws and regulations similarly seek to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the states’ citizens and prevent fraud and abuse. Accreditation organizations help to establish and support industry standards and monitor new developments.
  
  HCT/P Regulations
  
 Manufacturing facilities that produce cellular therapies are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA. In particular, U.S. FDA regulations set forth requirements pertaining to establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”). Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1271 (21 CFR Part 1271) provides for a unified registration and listing system, donor-eligibility, current Good Tissue Practices (“cGTP”), and other requirements that are intended to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases by HCT/Ps. While we currently have no plans to conduct these activities within the United States, these regulations may be relevant to us if in the future we become subject to them, or if parallel rules are imposed on our operations in China.
  
 We currently collect, process, store and manufacture HCT/Ps, including manufacturing cellular therapy products. We also collect, process, and store HCT/Ps. Accordingly, we comply with cGTP and cGMP guidelines that apply to biological products. Our management believes that certain other requirements pertaining to biological products, such as requirements pertaining to premarket approval, do not currently apply to us because we are not currently investigating, marketing or selling cellular therapy products in the United States. If we change our business operations in the future, the FDA requirements that apply to us may also change.
  
   
23



 
 
 Certain state and local governments within the United States also regulate cell-processing facilities by requiring them to obtain other specific licenses. Certain states may also have enacted laws and regulations, or may be considering laws and regulations, regarding the use and marketing of stem cells or cell therapy products, such as those derived from human embryos. While these laws and regulations should not directly affect our business, they could affect our future business. Presently we are not subject to any of these state law requirements, because we do not conduct these regulated activities within the United States.
  
  Pharmaceutical and Biological Products
  
 In the United States, pharmaceutical and biological products, including cellular therapies, are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act. However, because most biological products also meet the definition of “drugs” under the FD&C Act, they are also subject to regulation under FD&C Act provisions. The PHS Act requires the submission of a biologics license application (“BLA”), rather than a New Drug Application ("NDA"), for market authorization. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Presently we are not subject to any of these requirements, because we do not conduct these regulated activities within the United States.  However, these regulations may be relevant to us should we engage in these activities in the United States in the future.
