ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Background
 We were incorporated in Colorado on January 16, 2002.
 
We planned to sell custom framed artwork, art accessories, and interior design consulting. However, we generated only limited revenue and were inactive between 2008 and February of 2012.
 
In February 2012 we decided it would be in the best interests of our shareholders to no longer pursue our original business plan and, in April 2012 we became active in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties.
 
Effective September 2, 2016, we formally changed our name to Petrolia Energy Corporation, pursuant to the filing of a Statement of Conversion with the Secretary of State of Colorado and a Certificate of Conversion with the Secretary of State of Texas, authorized by the Plan of Conversion which was approved by our stockholders at our April 14, 2016, annual meeting of stockholders, each of which are described in greater detail in the Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 23, 2016. In addition to the Certificate of Conversion filing, we filed a Certificate of Correction filing with the Secretary of State of Texas (correcting certain errors in our originally filed Certificate of Formation) on August 24, 2016.
 
As previously reported, although the stockholders approved the Plan of Conversion at the annual meeting, pursuant to which our corporate jurisdiction was to be changed from the State of Colorado to the State of Texas by means of a process called a “Conversion” and our name was to be changed to “Petrolia Energy Corporation”, those filings were not immediately made and the Conversion did not become legally effective until September 2, 2016. Specifically, on June 15, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Conversion with the Texas Secretary of State, affecting the Conversion and the name change, and including a Certificate of Formation as a converted Texas corporation; however, the Statement of Conversion was not filed with the State of Colorado until a later date. As a result, and because FINRA and the Depository Trust Company (DTC) had advised us that they would not recognize the Conversion or name change, or update such related information in the marketplace, until we became current in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and they had a chance to review and approve such transactions, we took the position that the Conversion and name change were not legally effective until September 2, 2016.
 
As a result of the filings described above, and FINRA and the Depository Trust Company (DTC) formally recognizing and reflecting the events described above in the marketplace, the Company has formally converted from a Colorado corporation to a Texas corporation, and has formally changed its name to “Petrolia Energy Corporation”.
 
Two significant acquisitions were made in 2015 and additional working interests in the same properties were acquired in 2016, as described in greater detail in the “Plan of Operation” section below

Plan of Operation
 
Since 2015, we have established a clearly defined strategy to acquire, enhance and redevelop high-quality, resource in place assets. The Company has been focusing on acquisitions in the Southwest United States while actively pursuing our strategy to offer low-cost operational solutions in established Oil and Gas regions. We believe our mix of assets-oil-in-place conventional plays, low-risk resource plays and the redevelopment of our late-stage plays is a solid foundation for continued growth and future revenue growth.
 
Our strategy is to acquire low risk, conventionally producing oil fields. This strategy allows us to incorporate new technology to minimize risk and maximize the recoverability of existing reservoirs. This approach allows us to minimize the environmental impact caused by exploratory development.
 
Our activities will primarily be dependent upon available financing.
 
Oil and gas leases are considered real property. Title to properties which we may acquire will be subject to landowner’s royalties, overriding royalties, carried working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry, to liens for current taxes not yet due, liens for amounts owing to persons operating wells, and other encumbrances. As is customary in the industry, in the case of undeveloped properties little investigation of record title will be made at the time of acquisition (other than a preliminary review of local records). However, drilling title opinions may be obtained before commencement of drilling operations.
 
Minerva-Rockdale Field
 
The Minerva-Rockdale Field, which is located approximately 30 miles Northeast of Austin, Texas, was first discovered in 1921 and is approximately 50 square miles in size. The main producing formation for this field is the Upper Cretaceous Navarro Group of sands and shales. The Navarro is typically subdivided into several producing zones from the uppermost “A” and “B” sands to the lower “C” and “D” sands. The “B” sand is the primary producing zone. These sands are commonly fine grained and poorly sorted and were deposited close to a shoreline during a cycle of marine regression.
 
In April 2013, the Company entered into a lease pertaining to a 423 acre tract in Milam County, Texas, which is adjacent to the Company’s original 200 acre lease. The Company issued 500,000 shares of its common stock as consideration for a 100% working interest (75% net revenue interest) in such lease.
 
During the period from our inception to December 31, 2011, we did not drill any oil or gas wells. During the year-ended December 31, 2012 we drilled and completed six (6) oil wells and during 2013 the Company drilled and completed three (3) wells of which one (1) was converted to an injection well. During 2014 the Company drilled seven (7) new wells. In 2015, six (6) of the wells were completed, five (5) wells produced, one (1) did not produce and one (1) well was not completed. During 2016, the Company had thirteen (13) wells producing with one (1) injection well and one (1) did not produce/one (1) well not completed.
 
Slick Unit Dutcher Sands (“SUDS”) Field
 
The SUDS oilfield consists of 2,600 acres located in Creek County, Oklahoma and carries a 61% net revenue interest (NRI). The first oil producer was completed in 1918 by Standard Oil of Ohio (“Sohio”), which at that time was owned by John D. Rockefeller. By 1959, approximately 14,000,000 barrels of oil had been recovered at an average well depth of 3,100 feet and over 100 wells in production. Through a series of events, the infrastructure had deteriorated and the field suffered a lot of neglect. From 2011 to the acquisition date, Jovian Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries, Jovian Resources, LLC and SUDS Properties, LLC (together known as “Jovian”), the previous operator of the field, had invested an estimated $1.6 million into the restoration of the field; rebuilding the infrastructure and putting wells back in production.  Note that Jovian and its management is considered a related party. This designation is because two (2) individuals hold key management and ownership positions in both Companies which effectively results in joint control.  To date, 22 wells have been worked over and 9 are fully operational with considerable reserves remaining.  As a result of the transactions below, as of December 31, 2016, Petrolia is the operator and has a 100% working interest in this field.  Mr. Zel C. Khan, our Chief Executive Officer and President, is the former manager of Jovian and Mr. Quinten Beasley, our Director currently serves as President of Jovian.
 
SUDS 10% Acquisition
 The Company acquired a 10% working interest in the SUDS field located in Creek County Oklahoma on September 23, 2015, in exchange for 10,586,805 shares of restricted common stock. Based on the then current market value of our common stock, $0.068 per share, the price paid was $719,903 or $4.77 dollars per barrel of oil (Bbl). Through this transaction, the Company increased its reserve base by approximately 151,000 Bbls of (1P) proven reserves. Concurrently with the purchase, Jovian agreed to assign to the Company the right to be the operator of record of the SUDS field, governed by an American Association of Professional Landmen (AAPL) standard Joint Operating Agreement (JOA).
 
SUDS 90% Acquisition
 On the effective date of September 28 2016, the Company acquired a 90% net working interest in the SUDS field as a result of two separate agreements, Purchase and Sale Agreement and the Share Exchange Agreement, both between the Company and Jovian.

The Company issued two notes for a combined value of $4,000,000 in exchange for a cumulative 50% working interest in SUDS.  See Note 6 – NOTES PAYABLE of the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for a complete description of the note terms.
 
The Company issued 24,308,985 shares of its restricted common stock to Jovian to acquire an additional 40% working interest ownership of SUDS. The purchase price of the shares equates to a $4,373,186 value, based on the $0.1799/share market price of our common stock on September 28, 2016 (the effective date of the transaction).
 
On November 11, 2016, the Board approved the expenditure of $150,000 to drill one new well at the SUDS field.  This new well is the pilot well in the Company’s infill drilling program at SUDS.  We believe this program will lead to an accelerated recovery of oil by adding wells in an existing field within the original well patterns.
 
Twin Lakes San Andres Unit (“TLSAU”) Field
 
TLSAU is located 45 miles from Roswell, Chavez County, New Mexico and consists of 4,864 acres with 130 wells. The last independent reserve report prepared by MKM Engineering on December 31, 2016, reflects approximately 2.7 million barrels of proven oil reserves remaining for the 100% working interest (of which we hold a 40% working interest).  During 2016, the field had ninety (90) total wells, eight (8) were producing on timers to equal one well as allowed by permit with thirty-two (32) requiring workovers and an additional fifty (50) will serve as  injection wells as needed and permits are acquired.  As of December 31, 2016 Petrolia was the operator of the TLSAU field (through an agreement with BSNM described below).  As of the date of this report, Petrolia owns a 100% working interest in the field.
 
TLSAU 15% Acquisition
 On November 4, 2015, the Company acquired a 15% net working interest in the TLSAU field located in Chavez County, New Mexico (the “Net Working Interest”) and all operating equipment on the field. Through this transaction, the Company increased its reserve base by approximately 384,800 Bbls of (1P) proven reserves. The Company was also assigned all rights to be the operator of the TLSAU unit under a standard operating agreement.
 
The total purchase price for the acquisition of the Net Working Interest and equipment rights was $196,875 or $0.52 dollars per barrel of oil (Bbl) and was paid to Blue Sky NM, Inc. (“BSNM”). The Company paid $50,000 in cash and gave a promissory note in the amount of $146,875. The $50,000 was paid by the CEO of the Company for the benefit of the Company and recorded as a shareholder advance. Subsequently, the $50,000 advance was converted into 800,000 shares of common stock at $0.06 per share and warrants to purchase 800,000 shares of common stock. In addition, a $1.3 million face value note payable to BSNM was purchased for $316,800 (6,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.0528 per share). With the inclusion of the note receivable, the price per barrel would be $1.33 dollars per barrel oil (Bbl). (See Note 5 and Note 6 of the audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 hereof for further details)
 
TLSAU 25% Acquisition
 On September 1, 2016 the Company acquired an additional 25% working interest ownership in the TLSAU field through the issuance of 3,500,000 shares of its restricted common stock to an unrelated party.  The purchase price of the shares equates to a $350,000 value, based on the $0.10 per share market price of Petrolia’s shares on September 1, 2016.  After the purchase, the Company owns a total working interest ownership of 40%.  The final purchase price allocation of the transaction is as follows: oil and gas properties acquired $392,252, asset retirement obligations assumed of $42,252.
 
Non Oil & Gas Properties Businesses
 
Askarii Resources, LLC
 
Effective February 1, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares in Askarii Resources LLC (“Askarii”), a private Texas based oil & gas service company. The Company acquired Askarii by issuing one (1) million restricted common shares. Based on the then market value of the Company stock at $0.05 per share, the aggregate value of the transaction is $50,000.
 
Askarii, while dormant for the last few years, has a significant history with major oil companies providing services both onshore and offshore- Gulf of Mexico. Using Askarii, the Company will engage in the oil field service business as well as the leasing of field related heavy equipment.  Askarii will also research various enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technologies and methods which it can use for the benefit of the Company’s oil fields.
 
There were no wells drilled during the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

The following table shows, as of April 17, 2017, our producing wells, developed acreage, and undeveloped acreage:
 

State | Productive Wells | Developed Acreage | | Undeveloped Acreage (1) | 
 | Gross | | Net | | Gross | Net | Gross | Net 
Texas | | 13 | | | | 13 | | 260 | 260 | 363 | 363 
Oklahoma | | 26 | (2 | ) | | 26 | | 1,040 | 1,040 | 1,564 | 1,564
New Mexico | | 12 | | | | 12 | | 500 | 500 | 4,364 | 4,364


(1) | Undeveloped acreage includes leasehold interests on which wells have not been drilled or completed to the point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of natural gas and oil regardless of whether the leasehold interest is classified as containing proved undeveloped reserves.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Represents twenty six (26) wells that were worked-over and capable of producing oil. Eighteen (18) of those wells experienced a repairable mechanical failure after a week of production. Those eighteen (18) wells are excluded from our producing well totals in the overview description above. Note that there were other wells that were worked over that never produce oil and are excluded from all of these reported amounts. 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The following table shows, as of April 17, 2017, the status of our gross acreage:
 

State | Held by Production | | Not Held by Production 
-----------+---------------------+-------+------------------------
Texas | | 623 | | —
Oklahoma | | 2,604 | | —
New Mexico | | 4,864 | | —

 
Leases on acres that are Held by Production remain in force so long as oil or gas is produced from one or more wells on the particular lease. Leased acres that are not held by Production require annual rental payments to maintain the lease until the first to occur of the following: the expiration of the lease or the time oil or gas is produced from one or more wells drilled on the leased acreage. At the time oil or gas is produced from wells drilled on the leased acreage, the lease is considered to be Held by Production.
 
Proved Reserves
 
Below is a table that provides historical average sales price per barrel and average production cost per barrel by geographical location and by year, for the last three (3) fiscal years.

 | Average Sales Price (per Bbls) ($) | | | Average Production Cost (per Bbls) ($) | | Oil Production (Bbls)

2016 | | 29.10 | (1) | | 186.25 | (2) | 842 


(1) | The market price offered for our New Mexico oil is typically lower than with our other states. There are fewer sales points in New Mexico and comparatively, they are not located as close to our production facilities. These inefficiencies result in a lower relative price for oil sales.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | The New Mexico field was being prepared for significant production during 2016 but due to permitting issues, the equivalent of only one well was allowed to produce. Consequently the number of barrels used to compute this metric was respectively lower which resulted in a higher than usual production cost per barrel in 2016.

Below are estimates of our net proved reserves as of December 31, 2016, net to our interest. Our proved reserves are located in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico.
 
Estimates of volumes of proved reserves at December 31, 2016 are presented in barrels (Bbls) for oil and, for natural gas, in millions of cubic feet (Mcf) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located.
 

 | Oil(Bbls) | | Gas(Mcf)
------------+-----------+-----------+---------
Proved: | | | 
Developed | | 1,206,010 | | — 
Undeveloped | | 1,021,230 | | — 
Total | | 2,227,240 | | ---

 
There was a significant increase of approximately 1.5 million barrels of proved reserves primarily due to the acquisition of working interests in the TLSAU and SUDS fields during 2016 (see explanations above).  This increase was offset by a reduction of approximately 500,000 barrels of proved reserves at the SUDS  field due to the delay of planned drilling of new wells.  The 2015 reserves estimate assumed an increase due to expected drilling that did not occur in 2016. The proved developed increased due to the additional wells brought online.
 
 
· | Bbl - refers to one stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, in reference to crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Mcf - refers to one thousand cubic feet.

Below are estimates of our present value of estimated future net revenues from our proved reserves based upon the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is determined by using estimated quantities of proved reserves and the periods in which they are expected to be developed and produced based on period-end economic conditions. The estimated future production is based upon benchmark prices that reflect the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for oil and gas during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016. The resulting estimated future cash inflows are then reduced by estimated future costs to develop and produce reserves based on period-end cost levels. No deduction has been made for depletion, depreciation or for indirect costs, such as general corporate overhead. Present values were computed by discounting future net revenues by 10% per year.
 

Future cash inflows | $ | 90,265,000 | 
---------------------------------------+---+-------------+--
Deductions (including estimated taxes) | $ | (57,446,760 | )
Future net cash flow | $ | 32,818,240 | 
Discounted future net cash flow | $ | 13,564,480 | 

 
MKM Engineering prepared the estimates of our proved reserves, future production and income attributable to our leasehold interests as of December 31, 2016. Michele Mudrone was the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the 2016 reserve report. Ms. Mudrone has more than 25 years of practical experience in the estimation and evaluation of petroleum reserves.  MKM Engineering is an independent petroleum engineering firm that provides petroleum consulting services to the oil and gas industry. The estimates of drilled reserves, future production and income attributable to certain leasehold and royalty interests are based on technical analysis conducted by engineers employed at MKM Engineering.
 
Zel C. Khan, our CEO, oversaw preparation of the reserve estimates by MKM Engineering. We do not have a reserve committee and we do not have any specific internal controls regarding the estimates of our reserves.
 
Our proved reserves include only those amounts which we reasonably expect to recover in the future from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, at current prices and costs, under existing regulatory practices and with existing technology. Accordingly, any changes in prices, operating and development costs, regulations, technology or other factors could significantly increase or decrease estimates of proved reserves.
 
Proved reserves were estimated by performance methods, the volumetric method, analogy, or a combination of methods utilizing present economic conditions and limited to those proved reserves economically recoverable. The performance methods include decline curve analysis that utilize extrapolations of historical production and pressure data available through December 31, 2016 in those cases where such data was considered to be definitive.
 
Proved undeveloped reserves increased from 2015 to 2016 as a result of the SUDS and TLSAU acquisitions.

Forecasts for future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production in the region with an economic cut-off for production based upon the projected net revenue being equal to the projected operating expenses. No further reserves or valuation were given to any wells beyond their economic cut-off. Where no production decline trends have been established due to the limited historical production records from wells on the properties, surrounding wells historical production records were used and extrapolated to wells of the property. Where applicable, the actual calculated present decline rate of any well was used to determine future production volumes to be economically recovered. The calculated present rate of decline was then used to determine the present economic life of the production from the reservoir.
 
For wells currently on production, forecasts of future production rates were based on historical performance data. If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated. An estimated rate of decline was then applied to economic depletion of the reserves. If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates.
 
Proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves were estimated primarily by the performance and historical extrapolation methods. Test data and other related information were used to estimate the anticipated initial production rates from those wells or locations that are not currently producing. For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at a date we determined to be reasonable.
 
In general, the volume of production from our oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities, or both, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. Accordingly, volumes generated from our future activities are highly dependent upon the level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves and the costs incurred in doing so.
 
Recent Events:
 
 SUDS 90% Interest Acquisition

On the effective date of September 28 2016, we acquired a 90% net working interest in the SUDS field located in Creek County, Oklahoma (the “Working Interest”) based on two separate agreements, the Purchase and Sale Agreement and the Share Exchange Agreement, both between the Company and Jovian.
 
The SUDS field is located in Creek County, Oklahoma and consists of 2,600 acres. From a prior transaction described above, we owned a 10% working interest in SUDS.


The Company issued two notes for a combined value of $4,000,000 in exchange for a cumulative 50% working interest in SUDS.
 
One note is a Promissory Note for $1,000,000 bearing interest at 5% and due on December 31, 2016.  If full payment is not made by December 31, 2016, the buyer will be entitled to extend the Note to June 30, 2017 by making a $10,000 payment in cash prior to maturity.  The Promissory Note is secured by a 12.5% undivided working interest in the SUDS field.  Although the note is due on December 31, 2016, in the event the Company closes financing related to the SUDS field, 50% of the net proceeds received from the financing will be applied to pay the Note.
 
The second note is a Production Payment Note for $3,000,000 paid out of twenty percent (20%) of the 50% undivided interest of net revenues received by the Purchaser that are attributable to the SUDS field assets.  The Purchaser shall make the production payments to seller no later than the end of each calendar month.  The Production Payment Note is secured by a 12.5% undivided working interest in the SUDS field.
 
Twin Lakes San Andres Unit Interest Acquisition

On the effective date of February 12, 2017, we acquired an additional 60% net working interest in the “Twin Lakes San Andres Unit” or “TLSAU” field located in Chavez County, New Mexico (the “Net Working Interest”) resulting from the execution of a Settlement Agreement on February 12, 2016.  The agreement assigned Dead Aim Investments’ (“Dead Aim”) 60% ownership interests to Petrolia.  As a result of this transaction, Petrolia now owns 100% ownership interest in TLSAU.  Consideration of $639,675 was given in exchange for Dead Aim’s working interest.  The consideration includes the forgiveness of the Orbit Petroleum Inc Bankruptcy Estate (“OPBE”) note of $316,800 (with a $1.3M face value) and the write off of $116,700 of Dead Aim’s outstanding accounts receivable to Petrolia.  Dead Aim assumed liability for the OPBE note that Petrolia purchased.
 
TLSAU is 35 miles northeast of Roswell, New Mexico and consists of 4,864 acres of which Petrolia already owned a 40% working interest in the property. The net reserves, based on internal estimates, are approximately 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe) and are part of the northwestern shelf of the Permian Basin. The San Andres formation holds 100% of the TLSAU production base.

Government Regulation
 
Various state and federal agencies regulate the production and sale of oil and natural gas. All states in which we plan to operate impose restrictions on the drilling, production, transportation and sale of oil and natural gas.
 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) regulates the interstate transportation and the sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas. The FERC’s jurisdiction over interstate natural gas sales has been substantially modified by the Natural Gas Policy Act under which the FERC continued to regulate the maximum selling prices of certain categories of gas sold in “first sales” in interstate and intrastate commerce.
 
FERC has pursued policy initiatives that have affected natural gas marketing. Most notable are (1) the large-scale divestiture of interstate pipeline-owned gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non-affiliated companies; (2) further development of rules governing the relationship of the pipelines with their marketing affiliates; (3) the publication of standards relating to the use of electronic bulletin boards and electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make available transaction information on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis; (4) further review of the role of the secondary market for released pipeline capacity and its relationship to open access service in the primary market; and (5) development of policy and promulgation of orders pertaining to its authorization of market-based rates (rather than traditional cost-of-service based rates) for transportation or transportation-related services upon the pipeline’s demonstration of lack of market control in the relevant service market. We do not know what effect the FERC’s other activities will have on the access to markets, the fostering of competition and the cost of doing business.
 
Our sale of oil and natural gas liquids will not be regulated and will be at market prices. The price received from the sale of these products will be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. Much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines.
 
Federal, state, and local agencies have promulgated extensive rules and regulations applicable to our oil and natural gas exploration, production and related operations. Most states require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and the filing of reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration of oil and natural gas. Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. The statutes and regulations of some states limit the rate at which oil and natural gas is produced from our properties. The federal and state regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because these rules and regulations are amended or reinterpreted frequently, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with those laws.
 
Competition and Marketing
 
We will be faced with strong competition from many other companies and individuals engaged in the oil and gas business, many are very large, well established energy companies with substantial capabilities and established earnings records. We will be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring oil and gas prospects since we must compete with these individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs. It is nearly impossible to estimate the number of competitors; however, it is known that there are a large number of companies and individuals in the oil and gas business.
 
Exploration for and production of oil and gas are affected by the availability of pipe, casing and other tubular goods and certain other oil field equipment including drilling rigs and tools. We will depend upon independent drilling contractors to furnish rigs, equipment and tools to drill our wells. Higher prices for oil and gas may result in competition among operators for drilling equipment, tubular goods and drilling crews which may affect our ability to expeditiously drill, complete, recomplete and work-over wells.
 
The market for oil and gas is dependent upon a number of factors beyond our control, which at times cannot be accurately predicted. These factors include the proximity of wells to, and the capacity of, natural gas pipelines, the extent of competitive domestic production and imports of oil and gas, the availability of other sources of energy, fluctuations in seasonal supply and demand, and governmental regulation. In addition, there is always the possibility that new legislation may be enacted that would impose price controls or additional excise taxes upon crude oil or natural gas, or both. Oversupplies of natural gas can be expected to recur from time to time and may result in the gas producing wells being shut-in. Imports of natural gas may adversely affect the market for domestic natural gas.
 
The market price for crude oil is significantly affected by policies adopted by the member nations of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”). Members of OPEC establish prices and production quotas among themselves for petroleum products from time to time with the intent of controlling the current global supply and consequently price levels. We are unable to predict the effect, if any, that OPEC or other countries will have on the amount of, or the prices received for, crude oil and natural gas.

Glossary of Oil and Gas Terms
 
DEVELOPED ACREAGE. The number of acres that are allocated or assignable to productive wells or wells capable of production.
 
DISPOSAL WELL. A well employed for the reinjection of salt water produced with oil into an underground formation.
 
HELD BY PRODUCTION. A provision in an oil, gas and mineral lease that perpetuates an entity’s right to operate a property or concession as long as the property or concession produces a minimum paying quantity of oil or gas.
 
INJECTION WELL. A well employed for the injection into an underground formation of water, gas or other fluid to maintain underground pressures which would otherwise be reduced by the production of oil or gas.
 
LANDOWNER’S ROYALTY. A percentage share of production, or the value derived from production, which is granted to the lessor or landowner in the oil and gas lease, and which is free of the costs of drilling, completing, and operating an oil or gas well.
 
LEASE. Full or partial interests in an oil and gas lease, authorizing the owner thereof to drill for, reduce to possession and produce oil and gas upon payment of rentals, bonuses and/or royalties. Oil and gas leases are generally acquired from private landowners and federal and state governments. The term of an oil and gas lease typically ranges from three to ten years and requires annual lease rental payments of $1.00 to $2.00 per acre. If a producing oil or gas well is drilled on the lease prior to the expiration of the lease, the lease will generally remain in effect until the oil or gas production from the well ends. The owner of the lease is required to pay the owner of the leased property a royalty which is usually between 12.5% and 25% of the gross amount received from the sale of the oil or gas produced from the well.
  LEASE OPERATING EXPENSES. The expenses of producing oil or gas from a formation, consisting of the costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities, including labor costs, repair and maintenance, supplies, insurance, production, severance and other production excise taxes.
 
NET ACRES OR WELLS. A net well or acre is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working interests in gross wells or acres equals one. The number of net wells or acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells or acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions.
 
NET REVENUE INTEREST. A percentage share of production, or the value derived from production, from an oil or gas well and which is free of the costs of drilling, completing and operating the well.
 
OVERRIDING ROYALTY. A percentage share of production, or the value derived from production, which is free of all costs of drilling, completing and operating an oil or gas well, and is created by the lessee or working interest owner and paid by the lessee or working interest owner to the owner of the overriding royalty.
 
PRODUCING PROPERTY. A property (or interest therein) producing oil or gas in commercial quantities or that is shut-in but capable of producing oil or gas in commercial quantities. Interests in a property may include working interests, production payments, royalty interests and other non-working interests.
 
PROSPECT. An area in which a party owns or intends to acquire one or more oil and gas interests, which is geographically defined on the basis of geological data and which is reasonably anticipated to contain at least one reservoir of oil, gas or other hydrocarbons.
 
PROVED RESERVES. Those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geosciences and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible, from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
 
SHUT-IN WELL. A well which is capable of producing oil or gas but which is temporarily not producing due to mechanical problems or a lack of market for the well’s oil or gas.
 
UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE. Lease acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves. Undeveloped acreage should not be confused with undrilled acreage which is “Held by Production” under the terms of a lease.
 
WORKING INTEREST. A percentage of ownership in an oil and gas lease granting its owner the right to explore, drill and produce oil and gas from a tract of property. Working interest owners are obligated to pay a corresponding percentage of the cost of leasing, drilling, producing and operating a well. After royalties are paid, the working interest also entitles its owner to share in production revenues with other working interest owners, based on the percentage of the working interest owned.
