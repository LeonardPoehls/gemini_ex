     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
  Our Company 
         HD Supply is one of the largest industrial distributors in North America. We believe we have leading positions in the two distinct market sectors in which we specialize: Maintenance, Repair & Operations ("MRO") and Specialty Construction. These market sectors are large and fragmented, and we believe they present opportunities for significant growth. We aspire to be the "First Choice" of customers, associates, suppliers and the communities in which we operate. This aspiration drives our relentless focus and is reflected in the customer and market centricity, speed and precision, intense teamwork, process excellence and trusted relationships that define our culture. We believe this aspiration distinguishes us from other distributors and has created value for our shareholders, driven above-market growth and delivered attractive returns on invested capital. 
         Through approximately 220 branches and 44 distribution centers, in the U.S. and Canada, we serve our markets with an integrated go-to-market strategy. We have approximately 11,000 associates delivering localized, customer-tailored products, services and expertise. We serve approximately 500,000 customers, which include contractors, maintenance professionals, home builders, industrial businesses, and government entities. Our broad range of end-to-end product lines and services include approximately 600,000 stock-keeping units ("SKUs") of quality, name-brand and proprietary-brand products as well as value-add services supporting the entire life-cycle of a project from construction to maintenance, repair and operations. 
         For the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018, or fiscal 2017, we:
 

 generated $5 billion in Net sales, representing 6.3% growth over the fiscal year ended January 29, 2017, or fiscal 2016; 
 generated Net income of $970 million in fiscal 2017, including a $732 million gain on sale, net of tax, on the sale of the
Waterworks business, as compared to a Net income of $196 million in fiscal 2016; 
 generated $731 million of Adjusted EBITDA, representing 7.5% growth over fiscal 2016; and 
 generated $447 million of Adjusted net income in fiscal 2017, as compared to $302 million in fiscal 2016. 

         For a reconciliation of Net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income, see "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsKey Business MetricsAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss)." 
         We believe our long-standing customer relationships and competitive advantage stem from our knowledgeable associates, extensive product and service offerings, national footprint, integrated best-in-class technology, broad purchasing scale and strategic supplier relationships. We believe that our comprehensive supply chain solutions improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our customers' businesses. Our value-add services include customer training and certification, material and product fabrication, kitting, jobsite delivery and installation and will-call pickup options. Furthermore, we believe our product application knowledge, comprehensive product assortment, and sourcing expertise allow our customers to perform reliably and give them the tools to enhance profitability. 
         We reach our customers through a variety of sales channels, including professional outside and inside sales forces, call centers and direct marketing programs utilizing market-specific product catalogs, and business unit websites and digital tools. Our distribution network allows us to provide rapid, reliable, on-time delivery and customer pickup throughout the United States and Canada. Additionally, 
 8

   we believe our highly integrated, best-in-class technology provides leading e-commerce and integrated workflow capabilities for our customers, while providing us unparalleled pricing, budgeting, reporting and analytical capabilities across our Company. We believe customers view us as an integral part of the value chain due to our extensive product knowledge, expansive product availability and the ability to directly integrate with their systems and workflows. 
   Our Strategy 
         Since 2007 we have undertaken significant operating and growth initiatives at all levels. We developed and are implementing a multi-year strategy to optimize our business mix. This strategy includes entering new markets and product lines, streamlining and upgrading our process and technology capabilities, acquiring new capabilities and optimizing our portfolio of businesses. At the same time, we attracted what we believe to be "best of the best" talent, capitalizing on relevant experience, teamwork and change navigation. 
         Both of our businesses invest in high-growth initiatives that align with our five growth plays: 
 

1.Sell
More to Existing Customers (i.e., Share of Wallet)
2.Introduce
New Products and Services
3.Expand
the Channels to Reach Our Customers (e.g., Internet, Catalog, and Mobility)
4.Acquire
New Customers
5.Enter
New Geographies (i.e., Open New Locations) 

         Through investments in these growth plays, we believe we are well-positioned to grow in excess of the markets in which we operate. Specific initiatives focus on increasing penetration within our existing customer base, including the addition of new sales talent across the Company; and the addition of new products and services, including proprietary brands, primarily in our Facilities Maintenance business. We also continue to invest in mobile technologies and e-commerce. We focus primarily on sales talent acquisition and entering new geographies to acquire new customers. 
         HD Supply is managed primarily on a product-line basis and reports results of operations in two reportable segments. The reportable segments are Facilities Maintenance and Construction & Industrial. In addition, the consolidated financial statements include Corporate and Eliminations, which comprises enterprise-wide functional departments that operate in a centralized structure. 
  Facilities Maintenance.    Facilities Maintenance distributes MRO products, provides value-add services and fabricates custom products. Our Facilities Maintenance business unit serves the owners of multifamily, hospitality, healthcare and institutional facilities. Products include electrical and lighting items, plumbing, HVAC products, appliances, janitorial supplies, hardware, kitchen and bath cabinets, window coverings, textiles and guest amenities, healthcare maintenance and water and wastewater treatment products. Facilities Maintenance operates a distribution center-based model that sells its products primarily through a professional sales force, e-commerce and print catalogs. 
  Construction & Industrial.    Construction & Industrial distributes specialized hardware, tools, engineered materials and safety products to non-residential and residential contractors. Service offerings range from pre-bid assistance and product submittals to engineering and tool repair. Construction & Industrial reaches customers through a nationwide network of regionally organized branches as well as print catalogs and e-commerce. Products include tilt-up brace systems, forming and shoring systems, concrete chemicals, hand and power tools, cutting tools, rebar, ladders, safety and fall arrest equipment, specialty screws and fasteners, sealants and adhesives, drainage pipe, geo-synthetics, erosion and sediment control equipment and other engineered materials used broadly across all types of non-residential and residential construction. Construction & Industrial also includes Home 
 9

   Improvement Solutions, which offers light remodeling and construction supplies, kitchen and bath cabinets, windows, plumbing materials, electrical equipment and other products, primarily to small remodeling contractors and trade professionals through local retail outlets. 
  Corporate and Eliminations.    In addition to the reportable segments, our consolidated financial results include "Corporate and Eliminations" which incurs costs related to our centralized support functions, which are comprised of finance, information technology, human resources, legal, supply chain and other support services, and removes inter-segment transactions. All Corporate operating overhead costs are allocated to the reportable segments. Interest expense, interest income, other non-operating income and expenses, and provision for income taxes are not allocated to the reportable segments. The Company does not allocate Corporate assets to its reportable segments. 
   Our Market Sectors 
         We offer a diverse range of products and services to the Maintenance, Repair & Operations and Specialty Construction market sectors in the United States and Canada. The markets in which we operate have a high degree of customer and supplier fragmentation, with customers that typically demand a high level of service and availability of a broad set of complex products from a large number of suppliers. These market dynamics make the distributor a critical element within the value chain. Net sales for HD Supply outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, were $146 million, $124 million, and $124 million in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015, respectively. 
 Maintenance, Repair & Operations 
         In the Maintenance, Repair & Operations market sector, our Facilities Maintenance business unit serves customers across multiple industries by primarily delivering supplies and services needed to maintain and upgrade multifamily, hospitality, healthcare and institutional facilities. Facilities Maintenance is a distribution center-based model. We estimate that this market sector currently represents an addressable market in excess of $55 billion annually with demand driven primarily by ongoing maintenance requirements of a broad range of existing structures and traditional repair and remodeling construction activity across multiple industries. We believe Facilities Maintenance customers value speed and product availability over price. We believe our maintenance, repair and operations business focused on living spaces, including apartment units, hotel or motel rooms and senior care living facilities, provides stable demand, particularly in a challenging economic environment, when new construction tends to decrease. 
 Specialty Construction 
         In the Specialty Construction market sector, our Construction & Industrial and Home Improvement Solutions businesses serve professional contractors and trades by meeting their distinct and customized supply needs in non-residential, residential and industrial applications. We estimate that this market sector currently represents an addressable market of approximately $30 billion annually with demand driven primarily by residential construction, non-residential construction, industrial and repair and remodeling construction spending. Construction & Industrial serves this sector through the broad national presence of its regionally organized branch distribution network, as well as branches in six Canadian provinces, while Home Improvement Solutions operates through retail outlets in California primarily serving cash and carry customers. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the continued expansion of non-residential and residential construction end-markets. 
 Our History 
         In March 1997, Home Depot, the former parent of our operating subsidiaries, acquired Maintenance Warehouse / America Corp., a Texas corporation organized on January 26, 1985, and a 
 10

   leading direct marketer of MRO products to the hospitality and multifamily housing markets. Since 1997, our business has grown rapidly, primarily through the acquisition of more than 40 businesses. 
         From fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2004, we extended our presence into new categories while growing existing businesses through 10 acquisitions. New businesses included plumbing and HVAC (through the acquisition of Apex Supply), flooring products and installation (Floors, Inc., Floorworks, Inc., and Arvada Hardwood Floor Company) and specialty hardware, tools and materials for construction contractors (White Cap). Growth at existing businesses was driven organically and through "tuck-in" acquisitions, expanding our presence in the MRO market sector (N-E Thing Supply and Economy Maintenance Supply) and flooring and design services for professional homebuilders (Creative Touch Interiors). 
         In fiscal 2005, we accelerated the pace of consolidation by acquiring 18 businesses, the largest of which was National Waterworks, a leading distributor of products used to build, repair and maintain water and wastewater transmission systems. In fiscal 2006, we transformed our business with the acquisition of Hughes Supply, which doubled our Net sales and further established our market leadership in a number of our largest business units, which we supplemented with 11 other strategic acquisitions. 
         In 2007, investment funds associated with the Equity Sponsors formed Holdings and purchased HDS and the Canadian subsidiary CND Holdings, Inc. from Home Depot. In connection with the 2007 Transactions, Home Depot obtained a 12.5% interest in the then outstanding common stock of Holdings. 
         Since 2007, we have focused on extending our presence in key growth sectors and exiting less attractive sectors. In February 2008, we sold our Lumber and Building Materials operations to ProBuild Holdings. In June 2009, we purchased substantially all of the assets of ORCO Construction Supply, the second largest construction materials distributor in the U.S., through Construction & Industrial. In February 2011, we sold all of the assets of SESCO/QUESCO, an electrical products division of HD Supply Canada, to Sonepar Canada. In May 2011, we purchased all of the assets of Rexford Albany Municipal Supply Company, Inc., expanding our Waterworks business in upstate New York. In September 2011, we sold our Plumbing/HVAC operations to Hajoca Corporation. In March 2012, we sold our Industrial Pipes, Valves and Fittings business to Shale-Inland Holdings LLC. In June 2012, we acquired Peachtree Business Products LLC, which specializes in customizable business and property marketing supplies, to enhance Facilities Maintenance. In December 2012, we purchased substantially all of the assets of Water Products, expanding the geographic footprint of our Waterworks business. 
         On July 2, 2013, Holdings completed an initial public offering of 61,170,212 shares of its common stock at a price of $18.00 per share, for an aggregate offering price of $1,039 million, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering expenses of approximately $16 million. Upon completion of Holdings' secondary public offerings in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, the Equity Sponsors and Home Depot sold all of their remaining original investment in Holdings. 
         During fiscal 2014, we completed the disposal of Litemor through liquidation. In January 2015, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Hardware Solutions business to Home Depot. In October 2015, we sold our Power Solutions business to Anixter Inc. In May 2016, we sold our Interior Solutions business to Interior Specialists, Inc. In August 2017, we sold our Waterworks business to funds affiliated with CD&R. For additional information on the discontinued operations, see Note 2, "Discontinued Operations," within "Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
         In March 2018, we completed the acquisition of A.H. Harris Construction Supplies, a leading specialty construction distributor serving the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, expanding Construction & Industrial's market presence in the northeastern United States.

     Customers and Suppliers 
         We maintain a customer base of approximately 500,000 customers, many of whom represent long-term relationships. We are subject to very low customer concentration with our ten largest customers generating approximately 12.3% of our Net sales in fiscal 2017, reducing our exposure to any single customer. 
         We have developed relationships with approximately 8,000 strategic suppliers, many of which are long-standing. These supplier relationships provide us with reliable access to inventory, volume purchasing benefits and the ability to deliver a diverse product offering on a cost-effective basis. We maintain multiple suppliers for a substantial number of our products, thereby limiting the risk of product shortage for customers. 
   Competition 
         We operate in a highly fragmented industry and hold leading positions in both market sectors. The majority of our competition comes from mid-size regional distributors and small, local distributors; however, we also face competition from a number of national competitors, including Fastenal, Grainger, MSC Industrial, Watsco, Interline Brands (a Division of Home Depot) and Ferguson. 
         We believe the principal competitive factors for our market sectors include local selling capabilities, availability, breadth and cost of materials and supplies, technical knowledge and expertise, value-add service capabilities, customer and supplier relationships, reliability and accuracy of service, effective use of technology, delivery capabilities and timeliness, pricing of products, and the provision of credit. We believe that our competitive strengths and strategy allow us to compete effectively in our market sectors. 
   Seasonality 
         In a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically, sales of our products have been higher in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather and longer daylight conditions during these periods. Seasonal variations in operating results may also be significantly impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay construction projects and customer deliveries.

     Intellectual property 
         Our trademarks and those of our subsidiaries are registered or otherwise legally protected in the United States, Canada and elsewhere. We, together with our subsidiaries, own approximately 160 trademarks registered worldwide. We also rely upon trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect intellectual property rights through a variety of methods, including trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws, in addition to confidentiality agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who have access to our proprietary information. Generally, registered trademarks have a perpetual life, provided that they are renewed on a timely basis and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We intend to maintain our material trademark registrations so long as they remain valuable to our business. Other than the trademarks HD Supply ®, USABluebook ®, Seasons ®, Brigade ®, Maintenance Warehouse ® and White Cap ®, we do not believe our business is dependent to a material degree on trademarks, patents, copyrights or trade secrets. Other than commercially available software licenses, we do not believe that any of our licenses for third-party intellectual property are material to our business, taken as a whole. See "Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our BusinessIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, or we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our ability to compete could be negatively impacted." 
   Employees 
         In domestic and international operations, we had approximately 11,000 employees as of January 28, 2018, consisting of approximately 7,000 hourly personnel and approximately 4,000 salaried employees. 
         As of January 28, 2018, none of our hourly workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
   Regulation 
         Our operations are affected by various statutes, regulations and laws in the markets in which we operate, which historically have not had a material effect on our business. While we are not engaged in a regulated industry, we are subject to various laws applicable to businesses generally, including laws affecting land usage, zoning, the environment, health and safety, transportation, labor and employment practices, competition, immigration and other matters. Additionally, building codes may affect the products our customers are allowed to use, and consequently, changes in building codes may affect the saleability of our products. The transportation and disposal of many of our products are also subject to federal regulations. The DOT regulates our operations in domestic interstate commerce. We are subject to safety requirements governing interstate operations prescribed by the DOT. Vehicle dimensions and driver hours of service also remain subject to both federal and state regulation. See "Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our BusinessOur costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in U.S. federal, state or local regulations." 
 Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
         We are subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those pertaining to air emissions, water discharges, the handling, disposal and transport of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, the investigation and remediation of contamination and otherwise relating to health and safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources. As our operations, and those of many of the companies we have acquired, to a limited extent involve and have involved the handling, transport and distribution of materials that are, or could be classified as, toxic or hazardous, there is some risk of contamination and environmental damage inherent in our operations and the products we handle, transport and distribute. Our 
 13

   environmental, health and safety liabilities and obligations may result in significant capital expenditures and other costs, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be fined or penalized by regulators for failing to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, or we may be held responsible for such failures by companies we have acquired. In addition, contamination resulting from our current or past operations, and those of many of the companies we have acquired, may trigger investigation or remediation obligations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
