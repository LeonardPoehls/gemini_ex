Overview and Business of Issuer
 
We are an early stage medical tourism and services company. Through late 2017 our principal business was related to the software development of MyComputerKey™ and our other patented cloud computing technologies; however, due to cash flow constraints, we were unable to proceed with the further development of our software. Due to enhanced competition in the software development market and advancements in technology made by our competitors, we began evaluating alternative business plans.
 
Following the change in control of the Company pursuant to the SPA, the decision was made to put the software development on hold and to shift our primary business focus. Our newly revised business plan is directed towards medical tourism. The primary focus of our plan is the integration and development of synergistic relationships with high profiled doctors and hospitals that will act as a bridge for connecting patients and bio-technology advances in China with our Company’s network of US based doctors and hospitals. We intend to develop a scalable biomedical bridge for the US and China markets. We will provide concierge services for moving patients from China to the US with an emphasis on the following demographics:
 

(i) | cancer patient referrals that are in non-critical, non-life threatening positions,
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | pre-screening and genetic testing for family members of cancer patients,
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | patients suffering from Diabetes, and
------+--------------------------------------


(iv) | general medical services including preventative care and physicals.

The Company intends to develop working relationships with key medical innovators for possible joint ventures related to medical device manufacturing in China, including working towards obtaining China Food & Drug Administration (“CFDA”) approval for medical device sales to government owned hospitals. As of the date of this report, the Company has begun identifying qualified physicians and additions to the company’s management team to begin initiation of operations in the US. The business plan and is currently in the development phase.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies.  We plan to rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We plan also to rely on copyright laws to protect any future programs, devices, trademarks, and propriety processes and technology which we will utilize in executing our business plan.
 
We currently have no intellectual property related to medical tourism. We currently own all rights and patents associated with our past business endeavors such as the invention titled, “Apparatus Systems and Methods for Virtual Desktop Access and Management”, described under patent application (U.S. Serial Number 13/173,220) for systems and methods for accessing and managing a computer desktop, and with the invention titled, “System and Methods for One-Time Password Generation on a Mobile Computing Device”, described under patent application (U.S. Serial Number 14/295182) for process and methods of for one-time password on mobile computing devices. We have recorded a formal notice of assignment related to U.S. Serial Number 13/173,220with the United States Patent and Trademark Office previously held in the name of former executives of the Company, however U.S. Serial Number 14/295182 remained in the former executives name.
 
The patented system described under Serial No. 13/173220 is comprised of a removable virtual desktop Key permitting remote access and management of various computing devices that are communicatively linked to the Company’s secured cloud network. The Key allows the user secured virtual access and management of their desktop interface through a secondary computer only through unique user identification validation and a series of encrypted security file authentications including a DRM signature, a number of login credentials, and a biometric data template so even if passwords are breached the Key remains uncompromised.
 
The Company must actively manage risks related to maintaining its technology and systems which may be obsolete without further development. It may be more costly to upgrade obsolete technology and it may be more cost effective to fund the development of a replacement system or new technology all together.
 
From time to time, we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. Also, the efforts management has taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm the business, the brand and reputation, and the ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming.
 
Competition
 
Our potential competitors include Chinese based patient referral companies and agencies who provide international healthcare referral services similar to ours, such as Hope Noah Company in Beijing, Saint Lucia Consulting in Beijing, Shanghai Medical Tourism Products and Promotion Platform, and Ryavo Healthcare in Shanghai. Our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do, as well as established market share and the commercialization of their services. Our competitors’ services may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any services we may commercialize and may render our services obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of their development and commercialization. We anticipate that we will continue to face intense and increasing competition as new service providers enter the market and if we cannot maintain solid relationships with top tier physicians and hospitals. However, we believe that if we are able to further develop our business plan, establish solid relationships, and provide our own medical technology which has been developed by our majority shareholder, we may have key potential advantages over competitive services that could enable us to capture meaningful market share from our competitors.Industry Regulation
 
Our business is subject to a wide range of complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations related to privacy. HIPPA, data protection, and intellectual property, among others. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Failure to comply with, or changes in, laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences.

Trends in Medical Tourism
 
U.S. trade in health travel services (often called “medical tourism”) has grown steadily in recent years; exports (i.e., travelers coming to the United States) have doubled, and imports (U.S. travelers going abroad) have increased almost nine-fold from a low base in the early 2000’s. Despite rising costs, the U.S. health system continues to attract foreigners because of its high-quality services and its closeness to large patient markets. At the same time, more Americans are seeking more affordable care abroad, even if they must pay for their expenses out of pocket. The two most important barriers to increasing cross-border trade in health services are visa restrictions for travelers from certain countries entering the United States and a lack of coverage by many U.S. health insurers for treatments provided abroad.
 
In 2013, U.S. cross-border exports of health-related personal travel services were $3.3 billion, up from $1.6 billion in 2003, for a 7.7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Imports rose from $168 million in 2003 to $1.4 billion in 2013, implying a CAGR of 24%, albeit from a low base. Though health travel services represent only a small share of total trade in personal travel, they have consistently produced a trade surplus for the United States ($1.8 billion in 2013). Health travel exports grew faster than growth in spending on healthcare, with total U.S. personal healthcare expenditures rising at an average rate of 5.6% from 2002 to 2012 before slowing in 2013. The growth trend of these exports more resembles that of total U.S. travel exports, which rose 7.9% annually from 2003 to 2013.
 
About 0.5% of all air travelers entering the United States annually—between 100,000 and 200,000 people—list health treatment as a reason for visiting (this data excludes travelers from Canada and Mexico, the majority of whom travel to the United States overland). Foreign patients most often cite access to advanced medical care as their reason for traveling to this country for treatment.
 
Marketing
 
Because we are currently in the development stage of our business we have not engaged in any marketing activities. In mid-2018 we intend to implement a comprehensive integrated plan to achieve our business objectives. Our primary objectives include building brand awareness, developing lead generation programs that will drive sales and revenue, and developing an infrastructure that supports and measures our marketing activities. Our marketing activities will be driven by our website, organic and paid search optimization, direct marketing, events, social media, and eMarketing focused on small and medium sized businesses and individuals.
Employees
 
We currently have 2 active employees. We utilize independent contractors on a part-time/as needed basis to assist in our development activities, marketing, and financial and accounting support. We are also dependent upon our officers and directors for our future business development. As our operations expand, we anticipate the need to hire additional employees, consultants and professionals; however, the exact number is not quantifiable at this time.
