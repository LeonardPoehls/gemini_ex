 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
  
  General
  
  Corporate Background
  
  We are a Delaware corporation, incorporated on about May 12, 1988, and traded on an over the counter market (ticker symbol OTCQB:AFTM). As of June 30, 2017, there were 118,486,728 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. The Company's office and principal place of business, research, recording and mastering studios are located at 6671 Sunset Blvd., Suite 1520, Hollywood, CA 90028 USA, and its telephone number is (310) 657-4886. The Company also has an office at 7825 E. Gelding Drive, Suite 101, Scottsdale, Arizona 85260 USA, and its telephone number is (480) 556-9303.
  
  Aftermaster, Inc. (“the Company" or “Aftermaster”) is an audio technology company located in Hollywood, California and Scottsdale, Arizona. The Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries include Aftermaster HD Audio Labs, Inc. and MyStudio, Inc.
  
  The Company and its subsidiaries are engaged in the development and commercialization of proprietary (patents issued and pending), leading-edge audio and video technologies and products for professional and consumer use, including Aftermaster® Audio, ProMaster™, Aftermaster Pro™, Aftermaster Studio Pro and MyStudio®. The Company also operates recording and mastering studios at its Hollywood facilities.
  
  Aftermaster holds an unparalleled position in the audio technology industry and it is operated by a world-class team of experts with and extensive experience in music and audio technology. The Aftermaster team has produced, engineered and mastered more hit music than any other audio company in the world. We believe that our expertise and technical skills have led us to develop audio technologies unmatched in the audio industry. Aftermaster technologies are both patented and patent pending, and its technologies have won several awards. www.aftermaster.com
  
  Mission Statement
  
  Aftermaster's goal is to become one of the most innovative and important audio companies in the world through the development and licensing of proprietary audio technologies, the development and sales of leading-edge consumer and professional audio electronics products and through its contributions in the production, mixing and mastering of music, television and film audio.
 Year End Summary
  
  The Company is pleased to report that over the past year, its proprietary Aftermaster technology has begun to gain a marked foothold in the audio industry and that it’s products are receiving recognition and acceptance by consumers in over 65 countries. The revenues for fiscal year ending June 30, 2017 were generated from the sale of our proprietary Aftermaster Pro consumer electronics product, online and professional mastering services, and from studio rentals in Hollywood.
  
  During the year, the Company realized its first “quarter over quarter” sales growth from its Aftermaster technologies. For the quarter ending March 31, 2017, the Company recorded its then highest quarterly sales revenues of $266,621, which was followed by a nearly doubling of revenues to $510,138 in the following quarter ending June 30, 2017. Based on current and forecasted sales, the Company believes that it will continue to see increased sales growth from the sale of its consumer and professional hardware products (subject to having adequate inventory levels to meet demand), studio revenues and its partnerships with third party companies.
  
  Our sales growth has been dominated by the Company’s Aftermaster Pro product, which is its first consumer electronics product completely developed in-house. The Aftermaster Pro recently debuted to consumers on national television on the Home Shopping Network (“HSN”) television show on April 15, 2017. The Aftermaster Pro sales were deemed to be very successful and thousands of additional units were ordered. The product has since been featured on 5 additional HSN programs in June and September and additional programming with HSN has been scheduled for the fourth calendar quarter of 2017.
  
  In June 2017, the Aftermaster Pro also went on sale at Crate and Barrel's "CB2" stores (see below) and is also now available at several other prominent online retail outlets including Amazon.com, Walmart.com, as well as through the Company’s own website, www.aftermasterpro.com. The Company has engaged a well regarded on-line product marketing firm and will begin an online advertising campaign in October 2017 designed to drive buyers to our various online retailers using the ad process that produced highly successful sales metrics during our crowdfunding campaigns.
  
  Despite our recent record growth and proof of product interest by consumers, the Company is currently unable to keep up with the demand for its Aftemaster Pro product. The Company’s sales performance has been greatly impacted due to manufacturing and financing challenges, both of which have limited the timing and volume of the rollout of our products. The Company is currently working towards streamlining and stabilizing the manufacturing and financing challenges in order to substantially increase the manufacturing volume and sales of our products.

  The Company has also recently expanded its relationship with Tunecore, Inc. TuneCore is considered to be the premier music distribution company for independent artists and has one of the largest music catalogs in the world. We originally partnered with Tunecore in May 2016 to provide the professional hands-on professional music mastering for their independent artist services. Our professional hands-on music mastering service is headed up by Peter Doelle, one of the world’s most talented and respected mastering engineers.
  
  On August 28, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to expand its services to TuneCore and provide its proprietary Promaster instant music-mastering service for Tunecore artists that was previously done by Landr. The service launched on September 25, 2017 and now allows TuneCore customers to have their music mastered on-line instantly, with a quality never before available. The combined agreements now make the Company the exclusive partner for all of the mastering services offered by TuneCore’s, providing both professional hands-on and instant mastering services. We expect this relationship will provide additional branding awareness opportunities for Aftermaster’s suite of products.
  
 During the past year, the Company has also designed and developed its first professional hardware product dubbed the “Aftermaster Studio Pro” which is the Company’s first product designed for use in commercial and professional audio applications. The Aftermaster Studio Pro is a 1 U, 19” rack-mount Aftermaster audio processor that allows a user to enhance any audio playback with Aftermaster to make their sound fuller, clearer, louder and deeper. It will retail for $3,995 and can be seen at www.aftermastermaster.com/products. The Company believes that the worldwide market for this new product is significant, as it can be used in potentially hundreds of thousands of applications worldwide: radio stations, private and public recording studios, churchs, restaurants and bars, sports facilities, high-end residential audio systems, live concerts and concert facilities, hospitals – virtually anyplace where a business wants the audio to sound significantly better than anything they can do in house. The product will be available for pre-sale in October 2017 with expected delivery in December 2017.
 
  The Company engaged Bruce Pivic as Director of Manufacturing. He has over 45 years of experience in manufacturing and broadcasting. Mr. Pivic has a degree in electrical engineering from the University of Wyoming specializing in electronics and product development. His experience with Honeywell/GE product development brings experience in development and manufacturing quality. Mr. Pivic for the past 20 years has been the CEO and manufacturing specialist for Infinity Power and Controls. He is also the owner and CEO of Big Thicket Broadcasting, which operates three FM Radio stations (KQSW, KMRZ, and KSIT) and one AM radio station KRKK. KQSW presently is the first terrestrial radio station using the Aftermaster Pro in their everyday radio broadcasting.
  
 During the year, the Company completed an extensive renovation and subsequently opened a world-class music recording studio originally built by music legend Graham Nash and made famous by Crosby, Stills and Nash in 1977, which is located adjacent to its existing studios in Hollywood at Crossroads of the World. The studio is equipped with state-of-the-art recording and mixing equipment, and it is used for both audio research and development as well as to generate revenue from rental to musicians. The Company considers it to be among the finest recording studios in the US, and it began generating revenue in the first quarter of calendar 2017. It is the largest of the six recording studios that Aftermaster now operates at its studio facilities in Hollywood. www.aftermaster.com/studios
  
  Investment Bankers
  
  The recent successful introduction of our Aftermaster Pro has led the Company to engage a respected investment banking firm that specializes in small cap stocks, Maxim Group of New York, to assist the Company in concurrently raising the capital to both extinguish its current debt and to provide the additional growth capital required for the Company to complete an uplisting of its shares to a larger trading platform. Such financing is contingent on market conditions, share price and the performance of the company over the next two fiscal quarters. There is no guarantee that we will raise such capital or complete such an uplisting.
  
  TuneCore Agreement
  
  Aftermaster offers both world-class, professional hands-on mastering services and instant online mastering through its Promaster brand for music, TV and film customers in its facilities in Hollywood, California. Aftermaster’s Professional Mastering Division is headed up by Peter Doell, one of the world’s foremost mastering engineers. In May 2016, the Company entered into a partnership with TuneCore Digital Music Services to provide professional hands-on mastering services to TuneCore’s customers. In September 2017, the Company expanded its relationship with TuneCore and entered into a multi-year agreement to also provide TuneCore with the Company’s award-winning Promaster instant online mastering service to TuneCore’s artists. The agreement displaced TuneCore’s previous relationship with online mastering service, Landr.
 
  Currently, TuneCore is one of the world's largest independent digital music distribution and publishing administration service. Under our agreement, Aftermaster has become the platform for both hands-on professional and online instant mastering services for TuneCore’s artists on an exclusive basis. TuneCore has one of the highest artist revenue-generating music catalogs in the world, earning TuneCore Artists approximately $987 million from billions of downloads and streams. TuneCore’s music distribution services help artists, labels and managers sell their music through iTunes, Amazon Music, Spotify and other major download and streaming sites while retaining 100% of their sales revenue and rights for a low annual flat fee. TuneCore’s artists have direct access to Aftermaster's world-class senior mastering engineers and unmatched technologies and can get their tracks hand mastered for a premium price or instantly electronically mastered through Aftermaster's Promaster, returned and ready for distribution. The partnership builds upon TuneCore's mission to provide independent artists with key tools to build their careers and gain broad fan expsoure, by granting access to unparalleled mastering that meets the industry's highest standards.

  Home Shopping Network
  
  On April 15, 2017, the Company introduced its Aftermaster Pro personal re-mastering device on national television on the Home Shopping Network during two 15-minute infomercials. Home Shopping Network is one of the world’s largest television retailers. HSN initially purchased 1,000 Aftermaster Pros, and its management team has expessed to the Company that it considered the launch to be a big success. HSN has subsequently issued the Company purchase orders for several thousand more units for sale on-air shows on June 9, 2017 and September 2, 2017. Additional dates are expected to be announced for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. HSN provides a unique format for the Company to showcase the quality of the product, while explaining the unique features and operation of its Aftermaster Pro on national television. The Company expects that Aftermaster Pro will continue to be featured on HSN and by other television shows, online and store based retailers.
 Icon Health and Fitness Products
  
  During the year, the Company entered into a consulting and license agreement with ICON Health & Fitness, Inc. (“ICON”), pursuant to which the Company will act as an audio technology development consultant to develop an AfterMaster-based sound module for integration with ICON’s exercise equipment. ICON will pay the Company a per module fee and receive a license from the Company to use or sell the modules and use the software relating to each module in its products. The Company will also provide audio tuning services to further enhance the sound quality for ICON’s other audio-enabled equipment. The Company has agreed with ICON on a product development schedule, and the companies currently expect to unveil an Aftermaster-equipped premium fitness product at the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (“CES”) in Las Vegas in January 2018.
  
 ICON Health & Fitness, Inc. is the world’s largest manufacturer and marketer of home fitness equipment, selling over 10 million audio-enable fitness-related devices annually. ICON manufactures treadmills, elliptical trainers, stationary bicycles, weight machines and benches, and yoga and Pilates equipment. ICON has a wide range of well-known and respected brands, products and technologies, and sells home fitness and health club equipment under the following brands: NordicTrack®, ProForm®, Weider®, Gold's Gym® Home Fitness and FreeMotion®. Its fitness technology brand, including Wi-Fi-enabled fitness equipment and fitness wearables, is iFit®.
  
  CB2 Marketing Agreement
  
  CB2 (a division of Crate and Barrel), a leading lifestyle furniture retailer, and the Company have entered into a multi-year partnership to bring music and lifestyle spaces together like never before. CB2 has unique positioning in the furnishings industry as a modern, affordable and socially responsible brand who regularly offers its sophisticated clientele new and exciting opportunities to better their lifestyle and living environments.
  
  Under the partnership, CB2’s customers will receive the chance to purchase the unprecedented leading-edge audio through Aftermaster’s revolutionary technology to be showcased with the CB2 platforms in a myriad of ways. As part of its collaborative strategic venture, CB2 began offering the Company's Aftermaster Pro personal audio remastering devices at key store locations across the United States including West Hollywood, New York: Soho, South Beach, Chicago, and Austin. The units retail at $189.99 in stores and online at CB2's website.
  
  In addition, Aftermaster will now be a part of powering CB2’s “After Hours” concert series. The “After Hours” events transform CB2 locales into intimate nocturnal music experiences. Just after closing time, the stores play host to a bevy of notable artists as they perform a one-of-a-kind show to an exclusive audience sipping on cocktails in a chic and sophisticated atmosphere. Aftermaster provides enhanced audio capability for these shows with its proprietary technology and offers unrivaled sound in real-time. Attendees may also try the Aftermaster Pro at demo stations throughout the stores during these events. We believe this is another important brand awareness and revenue avenue for the Aftermaster Pro.
  
  Extending this partnership, CB2 also outfitted Aftermaster's famous music recording studios at Crossroads of the World in Hollywood, with a complete makeover of new furniture including "first-to-be-seen" pieces from their latest collection.
  
  Aftermaster Consumer and Professional Electronics Products
  
  The Company has assembled a world-class branding, technical and design team who have designed the the Companies first consumer and professional electronics product. The first consumer electronics product is the Aftermaster Pro, designed to dramatically improve the quality of TV audio. Aftermaster Pro is the world’s first personal audio re-mastering device and defines a new category in consumer electronics products by offering a product never before offered. Aftermaster Pro is a proprietary, first-to-market product which has no known direct competition.
  
  The number of existing televisions worldwide is substantial, and a majority of TV owners complain about their TV audio quality, especially the challenge of having to continually adjust the volume because of difficulty hearing dialogue in certain programming. Feedback from thousands of TV owners have provided the Company with valuable data that confirms that no manufacturer is delivering an audio solution with the same sound quality of Aftermaster Pro.

  Smaller than an iPhone, Aftermaster Pro transforms the audio of your TV, smartphone, headphones, laptop, tablet, gaming unit, or virtually any audio-enabled device to sound clearer, fuller, deeper, and more exciting. Aftermaster Pro connects easily via HDMI or 3.5mm audio cables with virtually any media source (i.e., cable, satellite box, cell phone, computer, tablet, etc.). When used with a television, Aftermaster Pro raises and clarifies dialogue in programming while significantly enhancing the quality of the overall audio content. This solves the longstanding issue with TV audio of having to continually adjust volume during a TV show to hear dialogue. When used portably with its built-in battery, Aftermaster transforms music and video to standards that we believe are superior to any portable audio enhancement device.
  
  The Company issued an initial purchase order and paid a substantial deposit for the electronic components and manufacturing of the first 100,000 circuit boards, which will allow an assembly manufacturer a significant head start for larger scale unit deliveries. The Company continues to be undercapitalized, which has affects our ability to compete with the majors in the audio world on a head-to-head basis who have inferior products. Subject to the availability of additional capital, the Company expects to complete the assembly of the units related to the aforementioned components purchase orders.
 
  Additional Aftermaster branded consumer electronics products products are under development, which we expect to introduce in the coming year.
  
 The Company recently developed the “Aftermaster Studio Pro” its first product designed for use in commercial and professional audio environments. The new product is a 1 U, 19” rack mounted Aftermaster audio processor that allows a user to enhance any audio playback with Aftermaster technology to make their sound fuller, clearer, louder and deeper. The worldwide market is significant as it can be used in radio stations, private and public recording studios, church’s, restaurants and bars, sports facilities, high-end residential, concerts and concert facilities.

  ON Semiconductor/Aftermaster Audio Chip and Software
  
  The Company entered into a joint development and marketing agreement with ON Semiconductor ("ON") of Phoenix, Arizona, to commercialize its technology through audio semiconductor chips. ON is a multi-billion dollar, multi-national semiconductor designer and manufacturer.
  
  The agreement called for ON to implement and support our Aftermaster technology in a digital signal processor (“DSP”) semiconductor chip that is being marketed toits current OEM customers, distributors and others. We selected ON as our partner for its technical capabilities, sales support and deep customer pool.
 
  In conjunction with ON, we have completed the development of an Aftermaster software algorithm that is designed to be used in semiconductor chips or as a standalone software product. We believe the sound quality from our algorithm provides a superior audio experience relative to other products on the market.
  
 Now branded the BelaSigna 300 AM chip, it is one of the smallest, high power/low voltage DSP chips available. It is small enough to fit into a hearing aid but equally effective in any size device with audio capability.
  
  Since entering into the agreement, both the Company and ON have identified a number of prospective customers that will be key targets for this new and unprecedented technology. The algorithm and chips allow consumer product manufacturers an opportunity to offer a significantly improved and differential audio experience in their products without having to significantly change hardware and form factor designs. Through the combined relationships of the Company and ON, we hope to generate significant revenues for both parties through the sale of the ON/AfterMaster chips and software licensing.
  
  Promaster
  
  Promaster is our online music mastering, streaming, and storage service designed for independent artists which utilizes proprietary audio technologies developed by Aftermaster.
  
  Tens of millions of songs are produced, distributed and played on the Internet each month around the world by independent artists. However, many of these artists lack the financial and technical means to master, or “finish” their composition, as a professional mastering session can cost up to $500 per song. Now, with the Promaster online platform, musicians can transmit their music directly to the Promaster HD website, where it can be mastered with Aftermaster technology for a minimal fee per song. Each user receives four different mastered versions of their song done in different styles, and they can preview 90 seconds of each version to make a decision about whether or not they want to buy it.
  
  Promaster creates a compelling offering for those seeking to significantly enhance the quality of their music for personal use, or with intent to showcase their music in hopes of advancing their career aspirations. Based on the enormous addressable market for this product, we believe that Promaster has the potential to generate significant revenues for the Company.

 Our Promaster on-line music mastering service was recently completely redesigned and launched on September 25, 2017 in conjunction with our new partnership with TuneCore. www.promasterhd.com
  
  Recording and Mastering Studios
  
  Aftermaster operates six (6) recording and mastering studios at its Hollywood California facility. The Company’s engineers mix and master music for both independent and high profile artists, including the music for the hit TV show "Empire".
 
 The Company recently took over the former recording studio built by music legends Crosby, Stills and Nash in 1977, which is located next to its existing studios. The Company recently completely renovated the studio and installed state-of-the-art equipment. The Company considers the new studio to be one of the finest recording studios in the US and it began generating revenues in the second quarter of 2017. www.aftermaster.com/studios
  
  Adobe Audition
  
  Aftermaster's Promaster on-line audio mastering service has been chosen to be included with Adobe® Audition® CC, a professional audio workstation for mixing, finishing and editing audio/video. The integration of Promaster will allow Adobe Audition CC users to instantly master their original work directly within Adobe Creative Cloud®. Promaster infuses the clearest, deepest sound quality into any recording, which elevates that audio to a studio remastered sound experience. Adobe's Audition CC with Promaster HD will enable its users to substantially cut editing time and enhance original audio work into fuller, deeper, louder and clearer tracks. When ready, users will install the Promaster extension from the Adobe Add-ons marketplace.
  
  The integration of Promaster into Adobe Audition has been delayed due the Company undertaking a complete redesign of its ProMaster website including adding many new features to the platform. The Company expects to complete the integration in the coming months.
  
  Aftermaster Audio Technology
  
  Aftermaster audio technology was created and developed pursuant to a multi-year, multi-million dollar development effort to make digital audio sound substantially better by developing proprietary software, digital signal processing technology and consumer products. The Aftermaster Audio Labs team is comprised of a unique group of award-winning industry leaders in music, technology and audio engineering which includes Ari Blitz, Peter Doell, Rodney Jerkins, Larry Ryckman, Justin Timberlake, Paul Wolff, Andrew Wuepper and Shelly Yakus. See www.Aftermaster.com .
  
  The Aftermaster audio technology is an internally-developed, proprietary (patented and patents pending) mastering, remastering and audio processing technology which makes virtually any audio source sound significantly louder, fuller, deeper and clearer. Aftermaster is a groundbreaking technology which eliminates the weaknesses found in other audio enhancement and processing technologies while offering a much superior audio experience for consumer and industrial applications. We believe that our Aftermaster audio technology is one of the most significant breakthroughs in digital audio processing technology and has the potential to create significant revenues for the Company. The broad commercialization of this technology is a top priority for the Company.
  
  As the convergence of features on consumer electronics continues, it is becoming more difficult for leading consumer electronics companies to differentiate their products. We believe that Aftermaster provides a unique and significant competitive advantage for consumer electronics manufacturers by offering their customers a superior audio experience. Aftermaster technology can be incorporated into most audio capable devices through the addition of an Aftermaster DSP chip or Aftermaster software. Such uses are intended to include phones (i.e., mobile, home, business and VoIP); headphones; televisions; stereo speakers; stereos (i.e., home, portable, commercial and automobile); and computers (i.e., desktop, laptop and tablets).
  
 Aftermaster audio is also the only commercial audio enhancement technology available that is used for professional music mastering because it enhances the entire frequency range without distortion or changing the underlying intent of the music. The technology has been used to master music created by some of the worlds most populat artists. Further information on Aftermaster and Aftermaster products can be found at www.Aftermaster.com.
  
  Intellectual Property and Licensing
  
  The Company has been awarded seven patents and seven trademarks with others pending. The Company has an aggressive intellectual property strategy to protect the Aftermaster and the related technologies it has developed. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We rigorously control access to our proprietary technologies. During the year, the Company engaged Morgan Chu of Irell and Manella, to represent its intellectual property interests along with its existing IP attorneys Farjami & Farjami LLP and Arnold Weintraub of the Weintraub Group. Mr. Weintraub serves on the Board of Directors of the Company.
