Item 1. Business
 The Company is a holding company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and its sole asset is a controlling equity interest in H.D.D. LLC (the “LLC”). Unless the context suggests otherwise, references in this report to “Truett-Hurst,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Truett-Hurst, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiary. Truett-Hurst consolidates the financial results of the LLC and records a noncontrolling interest for the economic interest in the LLC it does not own. The Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes two classes of common stock, Class A common stock and Class B common stock.
 Quantities or results referred to as “to date” or “as of this date” mean as of or to June 30, 2017, unless otherwise specifically noted. References to “FY” or “fiscal year” refer to the fiscal year ending on June 30th of the designated year. For example, “FY17” and “fiscal year 2017” each refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. This Annual Report on Form 10-K references certain trademarks and registered trademarks which may be trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective owners.
 On January 25, 2016, the LLC sold its fifty percent interest in The Wine Spies, LLC (“Wine Spies”) with an effective date of December 31, 2015. The results from Wine Spies, which were previously consolidated, have been deconsolidated in the Company’s FY16 audited consolidated financial statements. The gain on the sale has been recorded in the consolidated statements of operations on the discontinued operations line. 
 On October 8, 2017 and for several days thereafter, significant wildfires broke out in Napa, Sonoma, and surrounding counties in Northern California. Certain of the Company’s inventory, primarily juice pressed from grapes picked during the 2017 harvest and maintained at outside production and storage facilities, may be subject to spoilage. The Company believes that any loss of inventory related to the fires is substantially covered under the Company’s insurance policies. Additionally, there may be future negative impacts on the Company’s outside production and operating arrangements, including bottling and warehousing of case goods. See Note 14, “Subsequent Events”. 
 General
 The Company produces and sells premium, super-premium, and ultra-premium wines made generally from grapes purchased from California-based growers. In addition, the Company purchases semi-finished bulk wine under contract and opportunistically on the spot market. On a more limited basis, the Company also purchases finished goods from both foreign and domestic producers. The Company is headquartered in Sonoma County, California with a tasting room in the Dry Creek Valley. The Company owns its tasting rooms and winery in the Dry Creek Valley and leases space for wine production within a custom crush facility located in Santa Rosa, California. The wines include Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon and are sold across a number of price points via two distinct distribution channels: three-tier and direct to consumer. The business model is a combination of direct to consumer sales, traditional three-tier brand sales and retail exclusive brand sales. The Company owns, designs and develops its brands, including those developed and sold on a retailer exclusive basis. The Company’s brands are differentiated and marketed through innovative packaging and label designs.
 Wines in the three-tier channel are sold to distributors with programs available to the broad market or to specific retailers on an exclusive basis. The traditional three-tier distribution business consists of sales of VML, Healdsburg Ranches, Colby Red, Bradford Mountain, and Dearly Beloved branded wines. Through the retail exclusive brand model, the Company works with retail partners to develop innovative brands which resonate with their customers and are intended to increase store traffic and expand exclusive brand sales. The retail exclusive model allows the Company to own the brands it creates, which the Company believes differentiates it from the traditional private label model, and allows it the option of expanding the brands into national and international markets, thereby increasing sales and building the brand equity.  The direct to consumer channel consists of sales of products produced by the Company through its tasting rooms, wine clubs and its winery websites.

Strategic Objectives
 There are three primary categories into which the Company sells its wine: premium ($12 - $14 per bottle retail price), super-premium ($15 - $24 per bottle retail price), and ultra-premium ($25 - $49 per bottle retail price). The Company believes it can benefit from growth at the premium and above price points and continue to grow the business relying on its competitive strengths: its experienced and knowledgeable team; its relationships with the world’s top wine distributors and retailers; and its innovative approach to distribution and brand development. The Company intends to continue growing by:

• | Developing innovative retail exclusive products that meet the needs of wine retailers. The Company has a reputation for developing innovative retail exclusive brands and working with retailer partners on unique programs to support sales of those products. With branding expertise, the Company intends to continue innovation and build its market share with global wine retailers who are focused on increasing their profitability through retail exclusive offerings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growing the customer base to include additional major U.S. retail chains. The Company is actively pursuing relationships with the largest retail chains in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expanding the direct to consumer business. The Company’s wine clubs continue to grow due to growing consumer awareness of the brands from targeted public relations, exciting wine club events and advertising. The direct to consumer business generally generates higher gross margins and the Company intends to continue building this distribution channel in order to further growth.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Marketing to key international markets. Since fiscal year 2014, the Company has had a partnership agreement with the Trialto Wine Group, LTD, based in Vancouver, Canada, to distribute the Truett-Hurst family of brands throughout Canada. The Company also continues to review selective brand development and distribution opportunities in other international markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing new ways to engage customers and to distribute products. The Company continues to be discovery-oriented in its approach and is always looking for new innovations in and approaches to the global wine market. The Company believes that traditional wine marketing, to some degree, has stymied creativity and believes the Company’s innovative branding expertise allows the Company to rapidly capitalize on evolving customer demands.

Wine Operations
 Brands
 The Company operates two wineries where wine is produced from many varieties of grapes principally grown or purchased in Sonoma County’s Dry Creek Valley and Russian River Valley appellations. Established in 2007, Truett-Hurst was the first winery operation and brand that focuses on producing limited lots of super-premium wine from a range of varietals, including Zinfandel, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Noir, Petite Sirah and other unique red blends from grapes sourced from local growers in the Dry Creek Valley. Established in 2011, VML was the second winery operation and brand that focuses on producing limited lots of super-premium and ultra-premium wines from grapes purchased from local growers in the Russian River Valley. The primary varietals include Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, and Gewurztraminer.

Property
 The Company owns a 25-acre property located at 5610 Dry Creek Road, Healdsburg, California, of which approximately 15 acres is used for growing grapes.  The remainder of the property is used for the Truett-Hurst and VML tasting rooms, retail sales space, and office space for support staff.  Although the Company has maintained the proper permits to build a winery at this location and there is infrastructure, such as electricity and access to water, necessary to operate a winery on the property, the Company has not made the requisite capital expenditures to construct a building to house grape-crushing equipment and wine storage tanks.  The Company believes that the property can be used to expand its wine-making operations in the future and provide better control over wine quality.
 The Company leases wine production space within a custom crush facility located in Santa Rosa, California. The lease commenced on April 15, 2017 and ends on June 15, 2018. The initial 14-month term may be renewed for additional periods as agreed to by both parties. Previously, the Company leased a winery located at 4035 Westside Road, Healdsburg, California, but vacated those premises prior to May 31, 2017. Certain of these facilities may have been impacted by the Northern California wildfires in October 2017. See Note 14, “Subsequent Events”.
 Production
 The wine production space within the custom crush facility allows the Company to crush, ferment and oak barrel age approximately 700 tons (50,000 cases) of ultra-premium grapes annually, with capacity to increase to 1,000 tons with additional capital improvements. For increased production capacity, the Company outsources to a variety of specialist wineries and bottling facilities. The Company has been able to satisfy the production requirements to date and considers its sources to be adequate at this time. However, the inability of any of the suppliers to satisfy the Company’s requirements could adversely affect operations.
Grape and Wine Contracts
 The majority of annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each year’s harvest which normally begins in August and runs through October. In addition to purchasing grapes, the Company supplements its needs with bulk wine purchase contracts based on sales and production requirements. Depending upon overall demand and availability of bulk wine, the Company could experience shortages and/or increased prices.
 The Company enters into grape contracts with terms generally of one to four years, which requires payment of an agreed upon price per ton that varies according to the type of grape, its appellation and in certain cases, the vineyard block in which the grapes are grown.  Contracts are typically terminable after a specified term, unless earlier mutually agreed by the parties.
 Vineyards Owned by Founders
 Certain of the Founders operate or farm vineyards. The grapes produced from these vineyards are sold to the Company at market prices, with the balances sold to other wineries. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8, “Commitments and Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding related party commitments.
Sources and Availability of Production Materials
 The Company utilizes glass and other materials such as corks, capsules, labels and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of its products. After grape purchases and associated production overhead, glass bottle costs are the next most significant component of the cost of sales. The glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of quality producers. The Company obtains glass requirements from a limited number of producers under supply arrangements. The Company has been able to satisfy production requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider the sources of supply to be adequate at this time. However, the inability of any of the glass bottle suppliers to satisfy the Company’s requirements could adversely affect the Company’s operations.

Seasonality
 There is seasonality in the growing, procurement and transportation of grapes.  The wine industry typically experiences increased sales in October, November and December. Sales are typically higher upon the launch of a new product into the marketplace and when retailers promote brands through in-store displays and advertisements. The Company expects these trends to continue.  
Company Team and Culture
 The Company’s team consists of seasoned professionals who have worked their way up through the industry often achieving senior level positions in noted wine companies such as the Brown-Forman Corporation, Gallo, Domaine Chandon, Kendall-Jackson, and Fetzer Vineyards.
 In addition to building a seasoned team of professionals and shaping the entrepreneurial culture, an important part of the ongoing strategy is to create partnerships with the best organizations and professionals in order to leverage core competencies in the most efficient, cost effective and profitable manner.  The Company is proud of the corporate partnerships that have been created throughout the sales channels and the Company believes it can build a business that can change the way consumers purchase and enjoy wine.
 Sales and Marketing
 The Company employs a relatively small full-time, in-house marketing, sales and customer service organization. The sales and marketing team uses a range of marketing strategies designed to build brand equity and increase sales. Strategies include, but are not limited to, market research, consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale materials, event sponsorship, on premise promotions, social media and public relations.
 The Company’s sales are comprised of three segments; Direct to Consumer (“DTC”), wholesale retail exclusive brands, and wholesale national brands. DTC sales take place in our popular Dry Creek Valley tasting rooms and through our website. The Company has developed a significant wine club membership base whose members are shipped wine four times per year in quantities ranging from 3 to 12 bottles per shipment. The growing DTC segment represents approximately 28% of the Company’s net sales and 53% of the Company’s gross profit.  DTC sales have high margins, typically include more expensive wines, and create a “halo effect” for the Company’s retail exclusive and national brands. The company’s retail exclusive segment targets the top 50 on-premise (restaurants) and off-premise (grocery, drug, club) retail chains. U.S. retailers are embracing this category due to the higher margins they produce for the retailer and the exclusivity the retailers achieve with these brands. The national brand segment is comprised of brands the Company has developed and owns (VML, Dearly Beloved, Healdsburg Ranches, and the new Weight Watchers endorsed low SmartPoint ™ wine brand, Cense, as examples) and brands which the Company has partnered with others to sell and market (Colby Red). The Company sells these brands to on and off-premise regional and national chains, as well as independent restaurants, liquors stores, and grocery stores. The Company is able to compete and grow its national brand sales by differentiating its products with innovative packaging, value-priced high-quality wines, cause marketing, and by using large licensors.
 Competitive Environment
 All the segments the Company participates in are highly competitive. The Company competes on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength against domestic and multinational producers and distributors, some of which have greater resources than the Company, for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail stores, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention. Further, wine competes with other alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages.
 In the retail exclusive market, the Company competes against larger wine producers, including Constellation Brands, Inc., E.&J. Gallo Winery, Bronco Wines, Winery Exchange Inc., Vintage Wine Estates, Delicato Family Vineyards, and other California and international wine producers.
 There are relatively few publicly traded beverage companies with significant wine operations and most also have beer and spirits divisions.

Demand for wine in the premium, super-premium, ultra-premium and luxury market segments can rise and fall with general economic conditions.  The Company’s ability to respond to market demand, deliver a variety of wine styles, create and design innovative packaging combined with an effective distribution system will allow the Company to continue to penetrate the mainstream wine markets.
 Intellectual Property
 The Company protects proprietary rights through a variety of means and measures, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, contractual restrictions and technical measures. A number of brands are under registered trademarks. International trademark registrations are also maintained where it is appropriate to do so.  Each of the U.S. trademark registrations is renewable indefinitely so long as the Company is making a bona fide usage of the trademark.  As of September 1, 2017, the Company had 42 registered material trademarks, 3 published and 1 pending. 
Regulatory Environment
 The wine industry is part of the highly regulated U.S. liquor industry.  While there have been significant relaxations over time, such as those arising following the Granholm v. Heald U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2005, the U.S. wine industry is still highly regulated. For example, the Company is able to ship wine directly now to consumers and businesses in 42 states, but must only work through traditional “three-tier” distributors in the remaining 8 states.
 The production and sale of wine is subject to extensive regulation by the United States Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and the California Liquor Control Commission.  The Company is licensed by and meets the bonding requirements of each of these governmental agencies.  Sales of wine are subject to federal alcohol tax, payable at the time wine is removed from the bonded area of the winery for shipment to customers or for sale in the Company’s tasting rooms.  The current federal alcohol tax rate is $1.07 per gallon for wines with alcohol content at or below 14.0% and $1.57 per gallon for wines with alcohol content above 14.0% but less than 21%; however, wineries that produce not more than 250,000 gallons during the calendar year are allowed a graduated tax credit of up to $0.90 per gallon on the first 100,000 gallons of wine (other than sparkling wines) removed from the bonded area during that year.
 The Company also pays the state of California an excise tax of $0.20 per gallon for all wine sold in California.  In addition, all states in which wines are sold impose varying excise taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages.  Payments of these taxes are the responsibility of the supplier or distributor depending upon the channel in which the wine is sold.
 Consumer direct sales are also subject to state regulation which governs the quantity and manner in which products can be shipped, delivered and excise taxes collected.
 As an agricultural processor, the Company is also regulated by Sonoma County and, as a producer of wastewater, by the state of California.  The Company maintains all necessary permits.
 Prompted by growing government budget shortfalls and public reaction against alcohol abuse, Congress and many state legislatures are considering various proposals to impose additional excise taxes on the production and sale of alcoholic beverages, including table wines.  Some of the excise tax rate increases being considered are substantial.  The ultimate effects of such legislation, if passed, cannot be assessed accurately since the proposals are still in the discussion stage.  Any increase in the taxes imposed on table wines can be expected to have a potentially adverse impact on overall sales of such products.  However, the impact may not be proportionate to that experienced by producers of other alcoholic beverages and may not be the same in every state.
 Management is strongly focused on environmental stewardship and maintains a variety of policies and processes designed to protect the environment, the public and the consumers of its wine.  Many of the expenses for protecting the environment are voluntary, however the Company is regulated by various local, state and federal agencies regarding environmental laws where the costs of these laws and requirements of these agencies are effectively integrated into regular operations and do not cause significant negative impacts or costs.
 The Company believes they are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental laws and regulations in the countries in which it operates. The Company also believes that the cost of administration and 
 8


compliance with, and liability under, such laws and regulations have not had a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.
 Employees
 As of June 30, 2017, the Company had 29 full time, 26 part time, and 4 seasonal employees. The Company hires part time and seasonal help as needed. All employees were located in the United States. The Company believes that future success will depend in large part on the ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, and sales and marketing personnel. None of the employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes relations with their employees are good.

Emerging Growth Company Status
 The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, enacted on April 5, 2012 (“JOBS Act”).  For as long as the Company is an “emerging growth company,” the Company may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in the Company’s periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding shareholder advisory “say-on-pay” votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation.
 Under the JOBS Act, the Company will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of:
  
• | the last day of the fiscal year during which the Company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the Company’s IPO, June 30, 2018;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the date on which the Company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the date on which the Company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the Exchange Act (the Company will qualify as a large accelerated filer as of the first day of the first fiscal year after the Company has (i) more than $700 million in outstanding common equity held by the Company’s non-affiliates and (ii) been public for at least 12 months; the value of the Company’s outstanding common equity will be measured each year on the last day of the second fiscal quarter).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can utilize the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, the Company chose to “opt out” of such extended transition period, and, as a result, the Company will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that are not “emerging growth companies.”
 Smaller Reporting Company
 The Company became subject to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting company,” on the effective date of the Registration Statement. The designation of being a “smaller reporting company” relieves the Company of some of the more detailed informational requirements of Regulation S-K.
