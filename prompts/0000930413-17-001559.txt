Business Environment
 
fye Segment
 Video and music accounted for approximately 50% of the Company’s net sales in fiscal 2016 versus 65% of sales in fiscal 2015. Physical media sales have suffered from the shift of content to digital distribution, streaming and online retailers (e.g., Amazon) that offer entertainment products at discounted prices and collectively have gained a larger share of the market.
 
Based primarily on statistical information obtained from Warner Brothers Home Entertainment and Nielsen SoundScan (“SoundScan”); physical video and music represent an approximately $9 billion industry nationwide in 2016.
 
According to statistics obtained from Warner Brothers Home Entertainment, overall video industry physical retail sales in 2016 were $5.4 billion compared to $6.1 billion in 2015, a decrease of 11%. Industry DVD retail sales decreased 15% in 2016 compared to 2015, while Blu-ray sales decreased 4%.
 
According to statistical information from SoundScan, the total number of music albums sold, including CD and digital albums, decreased 16% to approximately 194 million units in 2016. Excluding digital albums, in fiscal 2016, album sales decreased 14% from fiscal 2015 to approximately 115 million units.
 
etailz Segment
 The Company’s etailz segment operates as a third party e-commerce market place (“Digital Marketplace”) reseller. Digital marketplaces are e-commerce platforms where online retailers enable third party sellers access to their website and customer base to sell new and used offerings. Digital marketplaces allow consumers to shop from a variety of merchants in one place and have become an integral part of many e-commerce sellers’ businesses, including Amazon.com, Walmart/Jet.com and ebay.
 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, total e-commerce sales for 2016 were estimated at $394.9 billion, an increase of 15% from 2015. Total retail sales in 2016 increased 3% from 2015.

Competition
 
fye Segment
 The specialty entertainment retail industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences. We compete with mass merchants, consumer electronics stores, lifestyle retailers and online retailers. Our media products are also distributed through other methods such as digital delivery. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value media products. Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers.
We compete with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”); Target Corporation (“Target”); Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon.com”); and Best Buy Co., Inc. (“Best Buy”), among others.
 
The Company has diversified its products and taken other measures to position itself competitively within its industry. The Company believes it effectively competes in the following ways:

▪ | Diversified product mix: the Company is expanding the range of product offerings in our non-media businesses. As a result, the non media categories contribution to total sales increased to 43% in fiscal 2016 as compared to 33% in fiscal 2015.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Customer service: the Company offers personalized customer service in its stores guided by a commitment to approach every customer with gratitude, humility and respect;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Location and convenience: a strength of the Company is its convenient store locations that are often the exclusive retailer in regional shopping centers offering a full complement of entertainment products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Marketing: the Company utilizes in-store visual displays, live events and a digital marketing strategy that employs email blasts and social networking.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
etailz Segment
 etailz competes with other third-party marketplace sellers using a data driven approach to digital marketplace retailing utilizing proprietary software and ecommerce insight coupled with a direct customer relationship engagement to identify new distributors and wholesalers, isolate emerging product trends, and optimize price positioning and inventory purchase decisions. In the past 12 months, etailz sold over 30,000 SKUs from over 2,000 manufacturers and distributors in numerous product categories, primarily through the Amazon Marketplace.
 
Seasonality
 
The Company’s business is seasonal, with its fourth fiscal quarter constituting the Company’s peak selling period and generating substantially all of its’ net income. The fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 was impacted by the inclusion of sales from etailz. In fiscal 2016, fourth quarter revenue for the fye segment accounted for approximately 34% of annual total revenue. Historically, revenue generated during the fourth fiscal quarter for etailz has demonstrated similar seasonality as the fye segment. In anticipation of increased sales activity in the fourth quarter, the Company purchases additional inventory and hires seasonal associates to supplement its core store sales and distribution center staffs. If, for any reason, the Company’s net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter, the Company’s operating results could be adversely affected. Quarterly sales can also be affected by the timing of new product releases, new store openings or closings and the performance of existing stores.
Advertising
 
The Company makes use of visual displays including in-store signage and external banners. The Company employs a marketing strategy including email blasts and social networking. Certain vendors from whom the Company purchases merchandise offer advertising allowances, of varying duration and amount, to promote their merchandise.
