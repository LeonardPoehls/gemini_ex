Item 1. BUSINESS
 
The predecessor of Jacobs Financial Group, Inc. (the “Registrant”, “JFG” or the “Company”), NELX, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Kansas in March 1983 as Nelson Exploration, Inc. In October 1993 the Company changed its name to NELX, Inc. On or about December 29, 2005, NELX was merged with and into its newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary, JFG, a Delaware corporation. JFG survived the merger as the Registrant. The merger effected a change in the Registrant’s name, a change in the state of incorporation of the Registrant from Kansas to Delaware, and amendments to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Registrant. The Company holds four wholly owned subsidiaries, FS Investments, Inc. (“FSI”), Jacobs & Company (“Jacobs & Co.”), First Surety Corporation (“FSC”) and Crystal Mountain Spring Water, Inc. (“CMW”).
 
FSI, incorporated in 1997 in West Virginia, is a holding company that was organized to develop surety business through the formation or acquisition of subsidiaries engaged in the issuance of surety bonds collateralized by investment accounts that are professionally managed by Jacobs & Co. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Triangle Surety Agency, Inc. (“Triangle Surety” or “TSA”), FSI is actively engaged in the placement with insurance companies of surety bonds, with an emphasis on clients engaged in regulated industries.
 
Jacobs & Co., incorporated in 1988 in West Virginia, and whose executive offices are located in Charleston, West Virginia, provides fee based investment advisory services to institutions, companies and individuals.
 
On December 31, 2005 the Company acquired the former West Virginia Fire and Casualty Company (WVFC), subsequently renamed First Surety Corporation (FSC), from The Celina Mutual Insurance Company (Celina). The acquisition consisted of the purchase of marketable investments and insurance licenses and did not include any existing policies or customer base as the insurance lines being offered by WVFC were not lines that new ownership intended to pursue. FSC is a West Virginia domiciled property and casualty company with licenses (multi-line) in West Virginia, Indiana and Ohio, targeting primarily coal and oil & gas industry surety markets in the Eastern United States. In 2006, the Company was licensed for the surety line of business in West Virginia. In 2008, the Company’s license for surety was expanded to include Ohio.
 
CMW has an undeveloped leasehold interest in a mineral water spring located near Hot Springs, Arkansas.
 
The Company is headquartered in Charleston, West Virginia, and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, employs a total of nine (9) full-time employees.
