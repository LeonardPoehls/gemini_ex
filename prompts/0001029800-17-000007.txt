Item 1. Business.
Organization
 
We are a real estate investment trust, organized as a Maryland corporation, engaged in the acquisition, ownership and management of commercial real estate. We were organized as an unincorporated business trust (the "Trust") under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on July 7, 1969. In 1997, the shareholders of the Trust approved a plan of reorganization of the Trust from a Massachusetts business trust to a Maryland corporation.  As a result of the plan of reorganization, the Trust was merged with and into the Company, the separate existence of the Trust ceased, the Company was the surviving entity in the merger and each issued and outstanding common share of beneficial interest of the Trust was converted into one share of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company.
Tax Status â€“ Qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust
 
We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), beginning with its taxable year ended October 31, 1970.  Pursuant to such provisions of the Code, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its real estate investment trust taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions regarding the nature of its income and assets will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.  Although we believe that we qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, no assurance can be given that we will continue to qualify as a REIT.
Description of Business
 
Our sole business is the ownership of real estate investments, which consist principally of investments in income-producing properties, with primary emphasis on properties in the metropolitan New York tri-state area outside of the City of New York.  Our properties consist primarily of neighborhood and community shopping centers and seven small office buildings near our headquarters.  We seek to identify desirable properties for acquisition, which we acquire in the normal course of business.  In addition, we regularly review our portfolio and, from time to time, may sell certain of our properties.
 
We do not consider our real estate business to be seasonal in nature.
 
At October 31, 2016, the Company owned or had equity interests in seventy-five properties comprised of neighborhood and community shopping centers, office buildings, single tenant retail or restaurant properties and office/retail mixed use properties located in four states throughout the United States, containing a total of 5.0 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA").  For a description of the Company's individual investments, see Item 2. Properties.

Investment and Operating Strategy
 
Our investment objective is to increase the cash flow and the value of our properties.  We seek growth through (1) the strategic re-tenanting, renovation and expansion of our existing properties, and (2) the selective acquisition of income-producing properties, primarily neighborhood and community shopping centers, in our targeted geographic region.  We may also invest in other types of real estate in the targeted geographic region. For a discussion of key elements of our growth strategies and operating policies, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
We invest in properties where cost effective renovation and expansion programs, combined with effective leasing and operating strategies, can improve the properties' values and economic returns.  Retail properties are typically adaptable for varied tenant layouts and can be reconfigured to accommodate new tenants or the changing space needs of existing tenants.  In determining whether to proceed with a renovation or expansion, we consider both the cost of such expansion or renovation and the increase in rent attributable to such expansion or renovation.  We believe that certain of our properties provide opportunities for future renovation and expansion.
 
When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider such factors as (1) economic, demographic, and regulatory conditions in the property's local and regional market; (2) the location, construction quality, and design of the property; (3) the current and projected cash flow of the property and the potential to increase cash flow; (4) the potential for capital appreciation of the property; (5) the terms of tenant leases, including the relationship between the property's current rents and market rents and the ability to increase rents upon lease rollover; (6) the occupancy and demand by tenants for properties of a similar type in the market area; (7) the potential to complete a strategic renovation, expansion or re-tenanting of the property; (8) the property's current expense structure and the potential to increase operating margins; (9) competition from comparable properties in the market area; and (10) vulnerability of the property's tenants to competition from e-commerce.
 
We may, from time to time, enter into arrangements for the acquisition of properties with  property owners through the issuance of units of limited partnership (or units of limited liability company) interests in entities that we control.  These units may be redeemable for cash or for shares of our Common stock or Class A Common stock.  We believe that this acquisition method may permit us to acquire properties from property owners wishing to enter into tax-deferred transactions.
 
At October 31, 2016, our properties collectively had 862 leases with tenants providing a wide range of products and services.  Tenants include regional supermarkets, national and regional discount department stores, other local retailers and office tenants.  At October 31, 2016, the sixty-eight consolidated properties were 93.3% leased (see Results of Operations discussion in Item 7).  At October 31, 2016, we had equity investments in seven properties which we do not consolidate; those properties were 98.4% leased.  We believe the properties are adequately covered by property and liability insurance.
 
A substantial portion of our operating lease income is derived from tenants under leases with terms greater than one year.  Certain of the leases provide for the payment of monthly fixed base rentals and for the payment by the tenant of a pro-rata share of the real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the properties.
 
For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, no single tenant comprised more than 7.4% of the total annual base rents of our properties. The following table sets forth a schedule of our ten largest tenants by percent of total annual base rent of our properties to total annual base rent for the year ended October 31, 2016.
 

Tenant | Number of Stores | % of Total Annual Base Rent of Properties 
-------------------------+------------------+-------------------------------------------
Stop & Shop Supermarkets | 7 | 7.4%

See Item 2. Properties for a complete list of the Company's properties.
 
The Company's single largest real estate investment is its 100% ownership of the general and limited partnership interests in the Ridgeway Shopping Center ("Ridgeway").
 
Ridgeway is located in Stamford, Connecticut and was developed in the 1950's and redeveloped in the mid 1990's. The property contains approximately 374,000 square feet of GLA.  It is the dominant grocery anchored center and the largest non-mall shopping center located in the City of Stamford, Fairfield County, Connecticut. For the year ended October 31, 2016, Ridgeway revenues represented approximately 11.3% of the Company's total revenues and approximately 7.6% of the Company's total assets at October 31, 2016. As of October 31, 2016, Ridgeway was 98% leased. The property's largest tenants (by base rent) are: The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company (19%), Bed, Bath & Beyond (14%) and Marshall's Inc., a division of the TJX Companies (11%).  No other tenant accounts for more than 10% of Ridgeway's annual base rents.
 
The following table sets forth a schedule of the annual lease expirations for retail leases at Ridgeway as of October 31, 2016 for each of the next ten years and thereafter (assuming that no tenants exercise renewal or cancellation options and that there are no tenant bankruptcies or other tenant defaults):

Financing Strategy
 
We intend to continue to finance acquisitions and property improvements and/or expansions with the most advantageous sources of capital which we believe are available to us at the time, and which may include the sale of common or preferred equity through public offerings or private placements, the incurrence of additional indebtedness through secured or unsecured borrowings, investments in real estate joint ventures and the reinvestment of proceeds from the disposition of assets.  Our financing strategy is to maintain a strong and flexible financial position by (1) maintaining a prudent level of leverage, and (2) minimizing our exposure to interest rate risk represented by floating rate debt.
Compliance with Governmental Regulations
 
We, like others in the commercial real estate industry, are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations.  We may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, on, in or under our properties, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property).  These laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence or disposal of those substances.  This liability may be imposed on us in connection with the activities of an operator of, or tenant at, the property.  The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the value of the property and/or our aggregate assets.  In addition, the presence of those substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remove those substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent that property or to borrow using that property as collateral, which, in turn, would reduce our revenues and ability to make distributions.
 
Our existing properties, as well as properties we may acquire, as commercial facilities, are required to comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  The requirements of this Act, or of other federal, state or local laws or regulations, also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons. Future compliance with this Act may require expensive changes to the properties.
 
Competition
 
The real estate investment business is highly competitive.  We compete for real estate investments with investors of all types, including domestic and foreign corporations, financial institutions, other real estate investment trusts, real estate funds, individuals and privately owned companies.  In addition, our properties are subject to local competitors from the surrounding areas.  Our shopping centers compete for tenants with other regional, community or neighborhood shopping centers in the respective areas where our retail properties are located.  In addition, the retail industry is seeing greater competition from internet retailers who do not need to establish "brick and mortar" retail locations for their businesses. This reduces the demand for traditional retail space in shopping centers like ours and other grocery-anchored shopping center properties.  Our office buildings compete for tenants principally with office buildings throughout the respective areas in which they are located.  Leasing decisions are generally determined by prospective tenants on the basis of, among other things, rental rates, location, and physical quality of the property and availability of space.
Property Management
 
We actively manage and supervise the operations and leasing at all of our properties.
 
Employees
 
Our executive offices are located at 321 Railroad Avenue, Greenwich, Connecticut.  We have 51 employees and believe that our relationship with employees is good.
