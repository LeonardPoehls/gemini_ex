Item 1.  Business.
Corporate History
 Gold Entertainment Group, Inc. was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 3, 1999 as a C corporation under the name ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES INC. / CANADA. The fiscal year end is January 31st. 
 On April 5, 2002, the Stock Exchange and Merger Agreement entered into between Gold Entertainment Group, Inc. and Advanced Medical Technologies, Inc. was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State. Advanced Medical Technologies, Inc., amended its name to Gold Entertainment Group, Inc. On August 28, 2007 the state of incorporation was changed from Nevada to Florida.
 
Commencing January 31, 2004, Gold Entertainment Group, Inc. was a developer and marketer of a national multi-level, fixed- price DVD rental program, and sought to become a leading home entertainment sales and rental company.  Gold Entertainment Group, Inc. marketed its products and programs exclusively through an independent network of distributors whereby its distributors promoted the company's DVD rental service with products shipped directly to consumers.  The Company maintains the web site: www.GoldEntertainment.com 
At the time, the Company had operations through its main office in Florida, and a Canadian subsidiary in Toronto, Ontario.
 The company is currently actively seeking new business opportunities.  During its operations, it had 11 full time employees.
 The company had as a wholly owned subsidiary, Quality Of Life Marketing Inc, a Canadian corporation, operated from rental facilities in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  It was intended to use this as a basis for its international operations at a later date.  Quality of Life Marketing Inc has no direct employees, and its registration has lapsed.  The historical information for the subsidiary is included in the consolidated financial statements attached to this filing.   The subsidiary was administratively dissolved on September 25, 2009 with the State of Florida.  It is no longer in operation.
 On January 3, 2017 the Company filed a FORM 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement, 60 days following the filing date, we became subject to the information and periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and we are required to file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Revenue
 We have no revenues for the years ended January 31, 2016 and 2017 or through the date of this filing.
 Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to seek an appropriate company as a working partner looking to develop new markets for its products or services. This may involve any of the following business strategies; licensing, co-ownership or distribution of a number of products and/or services suitable for the North American marketplace. The working partner company will have to provide proof to Management of its ability to sustain operations while expanding its market reach.
Employees
 As of October 31, 2016, we have no full-time employees.  Management is concurrently engaged in other endeavors and devotes as much time as it deems necessary to handle the affairs of the Company with other services provided on a contract basis.
 Our Approach to the Business
 
We believe there are opportunities to acquire and license products from companies that have existing revenue or are now operating under limited circumstances and can be redeveloped for profitable operation as part of the Company. When we identify such a prospect we determine whether there is reason to believe the prospect has revenue potential or existing operations, determine a value for the prospect, and, if warranted under all the circumstances, pursue a working business arrangement with the prospect. Our research has shown that there are potential products offered by companies in non-US markets that we believe have market potential in the US.
 
Historically, Gold Entertainment has focused its acquisition and development of technology companies with either consumer or small business customers, and Gold Entertainment intends to continue with that focus. Nevertheless, should Gold Entertainment receive unsolicited proposals on the acquisition of businesses in other industries that are attractive, we will investigate and, if warranted, make an effort to acquire an interest in such properties at acceptable terms.
 Our Chief Executive Officer, Hamon Francis Fytton, leads our evaluation process, consulting with professionals engaged by the Company. Our former Chief Financial Officer, Fred Schiemann, a licensed CPA, will assist in the financial analysis of prospective acquisitions with our Chief Executive Officer. We expect to hire independent contractors to perform specialized functions on an as needed basis.
 The Company has competitors and potential competitors include many companies of varying sizes, all of which are engaged in the acquisition and development of suitable business prospects. Most of our competitors have greater financial, personnel and other resources than we have. Consequently, they have greater leverage to use in acquiring prospects, hiring personnel and marketing their products. Accordingly, a high degree of competition in these areas is expected to continue.
 
Gold Entertainment presently has no full-time executive, operational or clerical employees.

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") Reporting Requirements

 Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to shareholders of the Company at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require the Company to provide the Company's shareholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to the Company's shareholders.  We are required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission on a regular basis, and are required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

 Effect of the Company being considered a "Shell" and Rule 144.

 Amendments to Form 8-K by the SEC regarding shell companies and transactions with shell companies that require the filing of all information about an acquired company that would have been required to have been filed had any such company filed a Form 10 Registration Statement with the SEC, along with required audited, interim and pro forma financial statements, within four business days of the closing of any such transaction (Item 5.01(a)(8) of Form 8-K); and the amendments to Rule 144 adopted by the SEC that were effective on February 15, 2008, that limit the resale of most securities of shell companies until one year after the filing of such information, may eliminate many of the perceived advantages of these types of going public transactions. These types of transactions are customarily referred to as "reverse" reorganizations or mergers in which the acquired company's shareholders become the controlling shareholders in the acquiring company and the acquiring company becomes the successor to the business operations of the acquired company. Regulations governing shell companies also deny the use of Form S-8 for the registration of securities and limit the use of this Form to a reorganized shell company until the expiration of 60 days from when any such entity is no longer considered to be a shell company. This prohibition could further restrict opportunities for us to acquire companies that may already have stock option plans in place that cover numerous employees. In such instances, there may be no exemption from registration for the issuance of securities in any business combination to these employees, thereby necessitating the filing of a registration statement with the SEC to complete any such reorganization, and incurring the time and expenses that are normally avoided by reverse reorganizations or mergers.  Certain amendments to Rule 144, adopted by the SEC and effective on February 15, 2008, codify the SEC's prior position limiting the tradeability of certain securities of shell companies, including those that we may issue in any acquisition, reorganization or merger, and further limit the tradeability of additional securities of shell companies; these proposals will further restrict the availability of opportunities for us to acquire any business or enterprise whose management may wish to utilize the Company as a means of going public. 
 Any of these types of transactions, regardless of their particular prospects, would require us to issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock that could amount to as much as 95% of our outstanding voting securities following the completion of any such transaction; accordingly, investments in any such private enterprise, if available, would be much more favorable than any investment in Gold Entertainment Group, Inc.
