DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 19, 2016. We are in the business of selling used automobiles that we purchase in the United States to customers in the USA and Dominican Republic. We purchase our automobiles primarily at used car stores, private sellers, dealer-auctions and sell them to private buyers or other car dealers in the USA and Dominican Republic. We plan to develop a website that will display a variety of used automobiles and their prices, and will advertise our services and fees. Our principal office address is located at Calle Duarte, No. 6, Sosua, Dominican Republic. Our telephone number is 829-217-2262. 

Our service includes checking the condition of the automobiles, shipping and handling and custom clearing if needed. Our goal is to maintain a 60 day turn around period for all inventory. We will display the automobiles that we own on our website. Our customers will be able to select an automobile on our website according to their budget and preferences. Our customers will also be able to order vehicles which are not displayed on our website by specifying the make, model and year. When we do not have the vehicles that our client wants, we search for it in automobile auctions and through a network of other car dealers. If our clients want to choose automobiles individually throughout the auction or other options, we consult them for 5-10% interest.
