We support our customers’ demand for diverse, comprehensive and regulatory compliant environmental solutions required for the safe and efficient drilling, completion and production of oil and natural gas from shale formations. Current services include: (i) logistics management, including via procurement, delivery, collection, storage, treatment, recycling and disposal of solid and liquid materials and waste products; (ii) temporary and permanent water midstream assets, consisting of temporary and permanent pipeline facilities and other water management infrastructure assets; (iii) equipment rental and staging services; and (iv) other ancillary services for E&P companies focused on the extraction of oil and natural gas resources from shale formations.
As part of our environmental and logistics management solutions for water and water-related services, we serve E&P customers seeking fresh water acquisition, temporary or permanent water transmission and storage, transportation, treatment or disposal of fresh flowback and produced water in connection with shale oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing operations. We also provide services for water pit excavations, well site preparation and well site remediation. We own a 60-mile underground pipeline network in the Haynesville Shale area for the collection of produced water, a fleet of more than 760 trucks for delivery and collection, and approximately 5,220 storage tanks. We also own or lease 50 operating saltwater disposal wells in the Bakken, Marcellus/Utica, Haynesville, and Eagle Ford Shale areas. Additionally, we own Appalachian Water Services, LLC (“AWS”) which operates a wastewater treatment facility specifically designed to treat and recycle water resulting from the hydraulic fracturing process in the Marcellus Shale area. 
As part of our environmental and logistics management solutions for solid materials, we provide collection, transportation, treatment and disposal options for solid waste generated by drilling and completion activities, including an oilfield solids disposal landfill that we own and operate in the Bakken Shale area. The landfill is located on a 50-acre site with current permitted capacity of more than 1.7 million cubic yards of airspace. We believe that permitted capacity at this site could be expanded up to a total of 5.8 million cubic yards in the future. During 2014, we completed construction of an advanced solids processing and recycling facility at the landfill site in North Dakota which is named TerrafficientSM, and enables E&P operators to recycle and re-use drill cuttings, bypassing the need for wellsite cuttings pits or special-purpose landfills. Beginning in early 2017, we expanded our service offering to include delivery and staging of proppant for use in well completion activities. Proppant typically consists of silica sand, treated sand or man-made ceramic materials and is used to prop open fissures created by hydraulic fracturing thereby allowing the release of hydrocarbons from the fractured shale formation. 
Our shale solutions business is comprised of three geographically distinct divisions, which are further described in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein:

• | Northeast Division: comprising the Marcellus and Utica Shale areas;


• | Southern Division: comprising the Haynesville and Eagle Ford Shale areas; and


• | Rocky Mountain Division: comprising the Bakken Shale area.

Competitive Strengths
We believe our business possesses the following competitive strengths, which position us to better serve our customers and grow revenue and cash flow:
Leading Transportation and Logistics Network to Control Delivery, Collection, Treatment, Recycling and Disposal.
The products we move within our logistics network include fresh water, drilling fluids, liquid waste, solid drilling waste, and oily wastewater. Our business practices and standards promote the safe and responsible collection, treatment, recycling and/or disposal of restricted environmental waste on behalf of our customers. As we expand our treatment, recycling, and disposal solutions, we believe controlling the products that are processed by these assets through our transportation and logistics network is a competitive strength when compared to competitors that rely more heavily on third-party providers for transportation and logistics expertise.
Our Customers are Highly Focused on Environmental Responsibility and Regulatory Compliance.
Our customers are committed to conducting their operations with high levels of environmental responsibility and regulatory compliance. They value a national environmental solutions provider that is focused on the safe and responsible delivery, collection, treatment, recycling, and disposal of their restricted products. There is a high level of scrutiny on the environmental impact of shale oil and natural gas drilling and production. As a result, we believe there is significant demand for Nuverra’s focus on surface environmental matters.

National Operating Footprint Appeals to Customers Operating in Multiple Shale Basins.
We are one of the few companies solely focused on surface environmental solutions with a national operating capability and a strong presence in the majority of North American unconventional shale basins. An increasing number of E&P operators have a presence in multiple basins, including a growing number of super majors, majors, and large independent companies. As a result, we believe we have a competitive advantage relative to many smaller local and regional competitors due to our national customer relationships and the demand for consistent and comprehensive solutions to customers' environmental needs across multiple basins.
Differentiated Value Proposition.
We continue to believe the future, long-term growth of domestic production of oil and natural gas in unconventional shale basins presents a unique growth opportunity for companies such as ours that provide comprehensive environmental solutions in a one-stop business model. Despite the prolonged downturn in oil prices, many industry experts and financial analysts are forecasting continuing advances in drilling and completion techniques in the unconventional shale basins in which we operate. These new techniques require significant environmental solutions to manage restricted waste products, and our customers remain committed to the responsible and safe handling of these products. As such, we believe our strategy to provide comprehensive environmental solutions, from collection through treatment, recycling or disposal, provides us with a strong competitive advantage. Many of our competitors offer only a single component of this value chain, with environmental solutions comprising a component of their overall business services. We believe our focus on the spectrum of surface-related environmental solutions makes it possible for us to provide customers with a consistent, compliant, professional, and highly differentiated value proposition.
Operational, Environmental and Regulatory Expertise.
We believe our management team and employees have significant expertise on the issues surrounding environmental waste products and can efficiently and safely provide services to our customers to manage this aspect of their business. We apply this experience to providing excellent service and identifying innovative, efficient solutions for our customers. We expect increasing regulatory compliance will increase the financial and operational burdens on our customers, which may increase demand for our services.
Strategy
Our strategy is to leverage our full-cycle business model to expand relationships with current and new customers and to provide comprehensive environmental solutions, including delivery, collection, treatment, recycling, and disposal of the environmental waste generated from unconventional shale oil and natural gas development and production. The principal elements of our business strategy are to:
Utilize Our Leading Transportation and Logistics Network to Expand Treatment, Recycling, Disposal, Rental and Water Solutions.
We intend to leverage our advanced transportation and logistics system to expand our treatment, recycling, disposal, rental and water midstream pipeline solutions in order to provide efficient and effective methods for the management of solids and fluids throughout the life cycle of customers' wells. We believe as the market in the unconventional shale basins evolves, customers will increasingly value a one-stop provider for all of their environmental solutions, including treatment, recycling, disposal, rental and water pipeline solutions for liquid and solid waste products. Our current transportation and logistics footprint provides the platform from which we can continue to expand our customer network while retaining our ability to provide safe and comprehensive environmental solutions.
Establish and Maintain Leading Market Positions in Core Operating Areas.
We strive to establish and maintain leading market positions within our core operating areas to realize the benefits and operating efficiencies provided by scale and customer penetration, as well as to maximize our returns on invested capital. As a result, we seek to maintain long-term customer relationships by providing comprehensive solutions in a safe, efficient and environmentally compliant manner. Combined with the increasing number of customers operating in multiple basins, we seek to maintain a continuous dialogue with our customers on a local, regional and national level in order to provide consistent solutions-based approaches to their ongoing environmental needs.

Provide Solutions in a Reliable and Responsible Manner.
We are focused on providing service efficiency and environmental sustainability through responsible practices that comply with all applicable regulatory requirements for our industry. We are committed to protecting the health and safety of our employees, partners and other stakeholders, reducing potential impact to the environment, supporting our communities, and enhancing the operations of our customers by providing exceptional services. These are key tenets that govern our daily activities and support our strategic vision. Our customers require high levels of regulatory, environmental and safety compliance, which we support through continuous employee training, maintenance of our asset base and our approach to developing environmentally sustainable solutions for customers. 
Develop and Implement Best Practices to Drive Efficiency and Economy.
We strive to implement best practices throughout our operating divisions, as we continuously seek ways to further enhance operating efficiencies and drive results. In conjunction with these efforts, for example, we have adopted comprehensive, uniform safety programs and training; consolidated a variety of back-office functions in order to expedite throughput; and implemented technologies to enhance the speed and accuracy of field data collection. We believe these programs have contributed to service excellence and differentiate us from our competitors. 
Industry Overview
For many years, E&P companies have focused on utilizing the vast resource potential available across many of North America’s unconventional shale areas through the application of horizontal drilling and completion technologies, including multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. We believe the majority of the capital for the continued development of shale oil and natural gas resources will be provided in part by large, well-capitalized domestic and international oil and natural gas companies. We believe these companies are highly focused on environmental responsibility, compliance, and regulatory matters and prefer to utilize experienced, highly qualified national vendors.
Advances in drilling technology and the development of unconventional North American hydrocarbon plays allow previously inaccessible or non-economical formations in the earth’s crust to be accessed by utilizing high pressure methods from water injection (or the process known as hydraulic fracturing) combined with proppant fluids (containing sand grains or ceramic beads) to create new perforation depths and fissures to extract natural gas, oil, and other hydrocarbon resources. Significant amounts of water are required for hydraulic fracturing operations, and subsequently, complex water flows, in the forms of flowback and produced water, represent a waste stream generated by these methods of hydrocarbon exploration and production. In addition to the liquid product stream involved in the hydraulic fracturing process, there are also significant environmental solid waste streams that are generated during the drilling and completion of a well. During the drilling process, a combination of the cut rock, or “cuttings,” mixed with the liquid used to drill the well, is returned to the surface and must be handled in accordance with environmental and other regulations. Historically, much of this solid waste byproduct was buried at the well site. We believe customers will increasingly focus on the treatment and offsite disposal or recycling of the solid waste byproduct. Produced water volumes, which represent water from the formation produced alongside hydrocarbons over the life of the well, are generally driven by marginal costs of production and frequently create a multi-year demand for our services once the well has been drilled and completed.
We primarily operate in the Bakken, Marcellus, Utica, Haynesville and Eagle Ford Shale areas.

• | The Bakken and underlying Three Forks formations are the two primary reservoirs currently being developed in the Williston Basin, which covers most of western North Dakota, eastern Montana, northwest South Dakota and southern Saskatchewan. The Bakken formation occupies approximately 200,000 square miles of the subsurface of the Williston Basin in Montana, North Dakota and Saskatchewan. The Three Forks formation lies directly below North Dakota’s portion of the Bakken formation, where oil-producing rock is located between layers of shale approximately two miles underground. According to the Assumptions to the Annual Energy Outlook 2016 report issued in January of 2017 by the United States Energy Information Administration (or the "EIA") with data as of January 1, 2014, the Bakken and Three Forks Shale formations in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana contain an estimated 22.7 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil reserves. According to the EIA's Monthly Crude Oil Production data, the Bakken Shale area is one of the most actively drilled unconventional resources in North America, with North Dakota crude oil production averaging 1.0 million barrels per day during 2016.


• | The Marcellus Shale area is located in the Appalachian Basin in the Northeastern United States, primarily in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York and Ohio. The Marcellus Shale is the largest natural gas field in North America with approximately 214.2 trillion cubic feet (or "Tcf") of technically recoverable natural gas, according to the EIA's report issued in January of 2017 with data as of January 1, 2014.

• | Adjacent to the Marcellus Shale is the Utica Shale, located primarily in southwestern Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. Still in the early stages of development, the Utica Shale play has three identified areas: oil, condensate and dry natural gas. According to the EIA's report issued in January of 2017 with data as of January 1, 2014, the Utica Shale is estimated to have approximately 188.6 Tcf of technically recoverable natural gas and 2.0 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil reserves.


• | The Haynesville Shale area is located across northwest Louisiana and east Texas, and extends into Arkansas. The Haynesville Shale area is the third largest natural gas-producing basin in North America, with an estimated 80.3 Tcf of technically recoverable natural gas according to the EIA's report issued in January of 2017 with data as of January 1, 2014.


• | The Eagle Ford Shale area is a natural gas and oil play located across southern Texas. The play contains a high liquid component, which has led to the definition of three areas: oil, condensate and dry gas. The Eagle Ford Shale is estimated to have approximately 51.4 Tcf of technically recoverable natural gas and 15.3 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil reserves, according to the EIA's report issued in January of 2017 with data as of January 1, 2014.

Customers
Our customers include major domestic and international oil and natural gas companies, foreign national oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas production companies. In the year ended December 31, 2016, our three largest customers represented 12%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenues.
Competitors
Our competition includes small regional service providers, as well as larger companies with operations throughout the continental United States and internationally. Our major competitors are Key Energy Services, Inc., Basic Energy Services, Inc., Superior Energy Services, Inc., Pioneer Energy Services Corp., Forbes Energy Services, Inc., Select Energy Services, MBI Energy Services, and Pinnergy, Ltd.
We differentiate ourselves from our major competitors by our operating philosophy.  We do not, unlike many of our competitors, conduct hydraulic fracturing and/or workover operations. None of these companies focus exclusively on the surface environmental aspects of unconventional oil and natural gas operations, a key aspect of our strategy as we focus on our fluid and solid waste treatment, recycling, and disposal capabilities.  We believe that offering a comprehensive environmental solution to our customers, which includes certainty of control of products from generation through disposal, recycling or reuse is an important value proposition and will increase in importance over time.  We believe our delivery and collection logistics network is a significant competitive advantage relative to competitors that are focused solely on solids treatment, recycling and disposal operations. 
Health, Safety & Environment
We are committed to excellence in health, safety and environment ("HS&E") in our operations, which we believe is a critical characteristic of our business. Our customers in the unconventional shale basins, including many of the large integrated and international oil and natural gas companies, require us to meet high standards on HS&E matters. As a result, we believe that being a leading environmental solutions company with a national presence and a dedicated focus on environmental solutions is a competitive advantage relative to smaller, regional companies, as well as companies that provide certain environmental services as ancillary offerings.
Seasonality
Certain of our business divisions are impacted by seasonal factors. Generally, our business is negatively impacted during the winter months due to inclement weather, fewer daylight hours and holidays. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, we may be unable to move our trucks and equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenue. In addition, these conditions may impact our customers’ operations, and, as our customers’ drilling and/or hydraulic fracturing activities are curtailed, our services may also be reduced. 
Intellectual Property
We operate under numerous trade names and own several trademarks, the most important of which are “Nuverra,” “HWR,” “Power Fuels,” and “Heckmann Water Resources.” We also have access, through certain exclusive and business relationships, to various water treatment technologies which, based on our experience, we utilize to create cost-effective and proprietary total water treatment solutions for our customers.
10

Operating Risks
Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in our industry, including accidents and fires that could cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment and the environment, suspension of operations and litigation, as described in Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, associated with these hazards. Because our business involves the transportation of environmentally regulated materials, we may also experience traffic accidents or pipeline breaks that may result in spills, property damage and personal injury. We have implemented a comprehensive HS&E program designed to minimize accidents in the workplace, enhance our safety programs, maintain environmental compliance and improve the efficiency of our operations.
Discontinued Operations
Our former industrial solutions business, also known as Thermo Fluids Inc. ("TFI"), was sold during the three months ended June 30, 2015. The industrial solutions business previously offered route-based environmental services and waste recycling solutions, providing customers a reliable, high-quality and environmentally responsible solution through a “one-stop shop” of collection and recycling services for waste products including used motor oil (“UMO”), oily water, spent antifreeze, used oil filters and parts washers. 
Following an assessment of various alternatives regarding our industrial solutions business in the third quarter of 2013 and a decision to focus exclusively on our shale solutions business, our board of directors approved and committed to a plan to divest TFI in the fourth quarter of 2013. On February 4, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement with Safety-Kleen, Inc. ("Safety-Kleen"), a subsidiary of Clean Harbors, Inc., whereby Safety-Kleen would acquire TFI for $85.0 million in an all-cash transaction, subject to working capital adjustments. On April 11, 2015, we completed the TFI disposition with Safety-Kleen as contemplated by the purchase agreement. The post-closing working capital reconciliation was completed in 2016, with $3.0 million released from escrow to us, and $1.3 million paid to Safety-Kleen for the post-closing adjustment and certain indemnification claims. (See Note 21 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.)
We classified TFI as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. 
Governmental Regulation, Including Environmental Regulation and Climate Change
Our operations are subject to stringent United States federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Additional laws and regulations, or changes in the interpretations of existing laws and regulations, that affect our business and operations may be adopted, which may in turn impact our financial condition. The following is a summary of the more significant existing health, safety and environmental laws and regulations to which our operations are subject.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
The United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as “CERCLA” or the “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain defined persons, including current and prior owners or operators of a site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these “responsible persons” may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies.
In the course of our operations, we occasionally generate materials that are considered “hazardous substances” and, as a result, may incur CERCLA liability for cleanup costs. Also, claims may be filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants. We also generate solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the United States Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or “RCRA,” and comparable state statutes.
Although we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been released at properties owned or leased by us now or in the past, or at other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes were taken for treatment or disposal. Under CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, we could be required to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.
11

Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act, as amended, or “CAA,” and similar state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain approvals or permits for construction, modification or operation of certain projects or facilities and may require use of emission controls.
Global Warming and Climate Change
While we do not believe our operations raise climate change issues different from those generally raised by the commercial use of fossil fuels, legislation or regulatory programs that restrict greenhouse gas emissions in areas where we conduct business or that would require reducing emissions from our truck fleet could increase our costs.
Water Discharges
We operate facilities that are subject to requirements of the United States Clean Water Act, as amended, or “CWA,” and analogous state laws for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters. Among other things, these laws impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants, including into navigable waters as well as the protection of drinking water sources. Spill prevention, control and counter-measure requirements under the CWA require implementation of measures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill. Other requirements for the prevention of spills are established under the United States Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or “OPA”, which amended the CWA and applies to owners and operators of vessels, including barges, offshore platforms and certain onshore facilities. Under OPA, regulated parties are strictly liable for oil spills and must establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such parties could be statutorily responsible.
State Environmental Regulations
Our operations involve the storage, handling, transport and disposal of bulk waste materials, some of which contain oil, contaminants and other regulated substances. Various environmental laws and regulations require prevention, and where necessary, cleanup of spills and leaks of such materials and some of our operations must obtain permits that limit the discharge of materials. Failure to comply with such environmental requirements or permits may result in fines and penalties, remediation orders and revocation of permits. In Texas, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Texas Railroad Commission and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, including those designed to protect the environment and monitor compliance with water quality. In Louisiana, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources as to environmental and water quality issues, and the Louisiana Public Service Commission as to allocation of intrastate routes and territories for waste water transportation. In Pennsylvania, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the Pennsylvania Public Service Commission. In Ohio, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. In North Dakota, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the North Dakota Department of Health, the North Dakota Industrial Commission, Oil and Gas Division, and the North Dakota State Water Commission. In Montana, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and the Montana Board of Oil and Gas.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are subject to the requirements of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or “OSHA,” and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety. OSHA’s hazard communication standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Saltwater Disposal Wells
We operate saltwater disposal wells that are subject to the CWA, the Safe Drinking Water Act, or “SDWA,” and state and local laws and regulations, including those established by the Underground Injection Control Program of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or “EPA,” which establishes minimum requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities. Our saltwater disposal wells are located in Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio and Texas. Regulations in many states require us to obtain a permit to operate each of our saltwater disposal wells in those states. These regulatory agencies have the general authority to suspend or modify one or more of these permits if continued operation of one of our saltwater wells is likely to result in pollution of freshwater, tremors or earthquakes, substantial violation of permit conditions or applicable rules, or leaks to the environment. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the saltwater wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in cancellation of 
12

operations of a well, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and claims by third parties for property damages and personal injuries.
Transportation Regulations
We conduct interstate motor carrier (trucking) operations that are subject to federal regulation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or “FMCSA,” a unit within the United States Department of Transportation, or “USDOT.” The FMCSA publishes and enforces comprehensive trucking safety regulations, including rules on commercial driver licensing, controlled substance testing, medical and other qualifications for drivers, equipment maintenance, and drivers’ hours of service, referred to as “HOS.” The agency also performs certain functions relating to such matters as motor carrier registration (licensing), insurance, and extension of credit to motor carriers’ customers. Another unit within USDOT publishes and enforces regulations regarding the transportation of hazardous materials, or “hazmat." The waste water and other water flows we transport by truck are generally not regulated as hazmat at this time.
In December 2010, the FMCSA launched a program called Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or “CSA,” in an effort to improve commercial truck and bus safety. CSA uses seven Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories, or “BASICs,” to determine a motor carrier’s safety performance and compliance relative to other carriers. Five BASICs, including unsafe driving, HOS compliance, vehicle maintenance, controlled substances/alcohol and driver fitness, are publicly available online in the Safety Measurement System (or “SMS”). Crash indicator and hazardous materials (or “HM”) compliance are only available to motor carriers that log into their own safety profile, or enforcement personnel. The BASICs organize data from roadside inspections, including driver and vehicle violations, crash reports from the last two years, and investigation results. Violations adversely affect a company’s SMS results for two years and may prioritize a company for an FMCSA intervention, ranging from warning letters to full on-site investigations that could result in an Out-of-Service Order (or “OOSO”) or a change to a company’s safety rating. Our trucking operations currently hold a “Satisfactory” safety rating from FMCSA (the best rating available) and we are continually monitoring our performance to drive improvement in each of the BASICs. 
In January 2016, FMCSA published in the Federal Register a notice of a proposed rule designed to enhance the FMCSA's ability to identify non-compliant motor carriers. The proposed rule would update FMCSA’s safety fitness rating methodology by integrating on-road safety data from inspections, along with the results of carrier investigations and crash reports, to determine a motor carrier’s overall safety fitness on a monthly basis. The proposed rule would also replace the current three-tier federal rating system of “satisfactory,” “conditional,” and “unsatisfactory” for federally regulated commercial motor carriers with a single determination of “unfit,” which would require the carrier to either improve its operations or cease operations. Carriers would be assessed monthly, using fixed failure measures that are identified in the proposed rule. Additionally, stricter standards would be used for those BASICs with a higher correlation to crash risk such as unsafe driving and HOS compliance. Further, violations of a revised list of “critical” and “acute” safety regulations would result in failing a BASIC, and all investigation results would be used, not just those from comprehensive on-site reviews. As a result, a carrier could be proposed unfit by failing two or more BASICs through inspections, investigation results and/or a combination of both.
Our intrastate trucking operations are also subject to various state environmental and waste water transportation regulations discussed under “Environmental Regulations” above. Federal law also allows states to impose insurance and safety requirements on motor carriers conducting intrastate business within their borders, and to collect a variety of taxes and fees on an apportioned basis reflecting miles actually operated within each state.
HOS regulations establish the maximum number of hours that a commercial truck driver may work and are intended to reduce the risk of fatigue and fatigue-related crashes and harm to driver health. Due to the specialized nature of our operations in the oil and gas industry, we qualify for an exception in the federal HOS rules (i.e., the “Oilfield Exemption”). Drivers of most property-carrying commercial motor vehicles have to take at least 34 hours off duty in order to reset their accumulated hours under the 60/70-hour rule, but drivers of property-carrying commercial motor vehicles that are used exclusively to support oil and gas activities can restart with just 24 hours off under the Oilfield Exemption. However, there are other HOS regulations that affect our operations, including the 11-Hour Driving Limit, 14-Hour On Duty Limit, 30-Minute Rest Break, 60/70-Hour Limit On Duty in 7/8 consecutive days. Compliance with these rules directly impacts our operating costs. 
Hydraulic Fracturing
Although we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, certain of our shale solutions customers perform hydraulic fracturing operations. While we believe that the adoption of new federal and/or state laws or regulations imposing increased regulatory burdens on hydraulic fracturing could increase demand for our services, it is possible that it could harm our business by making it more difficult to complete, or potentially suspend or prohibit, crude oil and natural gas wells in shale formations, increasing our and our customers’ costs of compliance and adversely affecting the services we provide.
13

Due at least in part to public concerns that have been raised regarding the potential impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water, the EPA has commenced a comprehensive study, at the order of the United States Congress, to assess the potential environmental and health impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities. Additionally, a committee of the United States House of Representatives is also conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. 
On February 11, 2014, the EPA released a revised underground injection control (UIC) program permitting guidance for wells that use diesel fuels during hydraulic fracturing activities. The EPA developed the guidance to clarify how companies can comply with a law passed by Congress in 2005, which exempted hydraulic fracturing operations from the requirement to obtain a UIC permit, except in cases where diesel fuel is used as a fracturing fluid. On July 16, 2015, EPA’s Inspector General (IG) issued a report entitled “Enhanced EPA Oversight and Action Can Further Protect Water Resources From the Potential Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing” stating that the EPA should enhance its oversight of permit issuance for hydraulic fracturing by states and develop a plan for responding to concerns about chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. On May 19, 2014, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking announcing its intention to develop a rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) to require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, and the EPA’s current regulatory agenda estimates that the proposed TSCA rule will be issued in June 2018. 
On October 15, 2012, the new EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act went into effect that require reductions in certain criteria and hazardous air pollutant emissions from hydraulic fracturing wells. The rule includes New Source Performance Standards, or “NSPS,” to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, or “VOCs,” and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. The EPA’s final rule requires the reduction of VOC emissions from crude oil and natural gas production facilities by mandating the use of “green completions” for hydraulic fracturing, which requires the operator to recover rather than vent the gas and natural gas liquids that come to the surface during completion of the fracturing process.
 On June 13, 2016, the EPA finalized regulations under the Clean Water Act to prohibit wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and other natural gas production to municipal sewage plants (called publicly owned treatment works (or “POTWs”)), with an effective date of August 29, 2016. In December 2016, the EPA announced that it was extending the compliance date of this new rule to August 29, 2019 for those onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities that had been lawfully discharging extraction wastewater to POTWs prior to August 29, 2019, while keeping the August 29, 2016 effective date for all other facilities. In December 2016, the EPA issued a final report entitled “Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle on Drinking Water Resources in the United States” that concluded that hydraulic fracturing can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, but stated that the national frequency of impacts on drinking water could not be estimated due to significant data gaps and uncertainties in the available data. 
In March 2015, the Department of the Interior (“DOI”) issued regulations requiring that hydraulic fracturing wells constructed on federal lands comply with certain standards and requiring companies engaged in hydraulic fracturing on federal lands to disclose certain chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. The regulations were enjoined by a federal district court in June 2016, and the DOI is currently appealing the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Legislation, including bills known collectively as the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act, or FRAC Act, have been introduced before both houses of Congress to remove the exemption of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure to a regulatory agency of chemicals used in the fracturing process and otherwise restrict hydraulic fracturing. If adopted, such legislation would add an additional level of regulation and necessary permitting at the federal level and could make it more difficult to complete wells using hydraulic fracturing. Similar laws and regulations with respect to chemical disclosure also exist or are being considered in several states, including certain states in which we operate, that could restrict hydraulic fracturing. The Delaware River Basin Commission is also considering regulations which may impact “hydrofracturing” water practices in certain areas of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Delaware. Some local governments have also sought to restrict drilling in certain areas.
Various state, regional and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements, and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain environmentally sensitive areas such as certain watersheds. The North Dakota Industrial Commission, Oil and Gas Division proposed regulations requiring owners, operators, and service companies to post the composition of the hydraulic fracturing fluid used during certain hydraulic fracturing stimulations on the FracFocus Chemical Disclosure Registry. The availability of information regarding the constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids could potentially make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, North Dakota proposed regulations prohibiting the discharge of fluids, wastes, and debris other than drill cuttings into open pits.

Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 799 full time employees, of whom 152 were executive, managerial, sales, general, administrative, and accounting staff, and 647 were truck drivers, service providers and field workers. In December 2015, a collective bargaining representative election was conducted among a unit of drivers in the Utica shale area. Of the eligible voters, 13 cast votes for Teamsters Local Union No. 348 and 12 cast votes against. On December 28, 2015, we filed three objections to the election, beginning the process of contesting the election. Around the same time, we received several unfair labor practice complaints from the National Labor Relations Board (or "NLRB") related to the yard subject to the contested election. In November 2016, we fully resolved all matters related to the collective bargaining unit by entering into a settlement agreement with the NLRB to resolve all pending unfair labor practice charges without admitting any violations of the National Labor Relations Act, and receiving a disclaimer of interest from Teamsters Local Union No. 348, disclaiming any interest in representing the bargaining unit and waiving any claim to being the collective bargaining representative of the employees in the bargaining unit. We have not experienced, and do not expect, any work stoppages, and believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees.
