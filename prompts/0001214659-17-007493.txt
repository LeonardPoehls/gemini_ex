GENERAL
 
We were incorporated on June 10, 2014 and intended to offer local guided tours via our web platform. Our future web site will connect travelers with freelance guides to facilitate the creation and purchase of private tours around the world. Customers will simply enter their destination, choose a tour with favorite guide and in just a few clicks, customers can book tour directly with the local guide. Before booking customers can check the guide's profile, see their feedbacks and even message the guide to customize a tour, tailored to customer needs. We intend to offer guided tours in Europe and North America (USA and Canada), and we plan to run our business from outside the United States during the first year of operation. Currently we have only testing version of our website.  Whether customer is looking for a city tour, wine tasting experiences, walking tours, bicycle tours or any other activity he/she wants to do together with a local, our web site will help customer to connect with locals all over the world.
ADVANTAGE OF LOCAL GUIDE
 
When customer has very little time, a knowledgeable local guide can give customized sightseeing according to the customer's wishes in a timely manner.  Good guides will know places to avoid, rush hours, shopping areas that offer bargain prices, and direct you from areas under construction or closed roads Local guides are very helpful for customers visiting ports on a cruise.  Customers can hire a tour guide to get them away from the hordes of passengers getting off ship and visit a quieter remote scene and enjoy a lunch at a local eatery. Because the tour guide is aware of limited time, he/she can plan your adventure and ensure return to the ship in time for boarding. When the customer is visiting a dangerous or chaotic location or the destination is in an area that has a reputation of political upheaval, a tour guide can help keep the customer safe. Unless customer is an expert, hiring a professional tour guide for extreme sports such as safaris, mountain climbing, scuba diving, deep sea fishing, white-water rafting; safety precaution should be a priority and it's best if customer will hire an experienced guide. On hikes or a nature trip, an experienced nature guide can provide information about the type animals that the customer may encounter, direct attention to different types of plants and explain the benefits to nature. A tour guide who speaks the local language can be an invaluable resource; both the customer and the native will be at ease with communication.

The online format allows such a referral to quickly become a client.

The competition in the online we will face comes from online web sites: www.responsibletravel.com, www.toursbylocals.com, tourguides.viator.com.
INSURANCE
 
We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation.
