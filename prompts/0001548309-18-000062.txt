Item 1. Business 
We are a national retailer primarily focused on selling home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, and hardware at our stores and on our websites. We also offer our customers the opportunity to acquire home appliance, lawn and garden, fitness, bedding, and other categories of merchandise and product protection agreements through our lease-to-own program that we operate by agreement with a third party. As of February 3, 2018, the Company or its independent dealers and franchisees ("our dealers and franchisees") operated a total of 900 stores across all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda. In addition to merchandise, we provide our customers with access to a full suite of related services, including home delivery, installation, and extended-service plans. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K we refer to ourselves as "SHO," "our company," the "Company," "we," "our," or "us." We became a publicly held company immediately following our October 11, 2012 separation (the "Separation") from Sears Holdings Corporation ("Sears Holdings"). 
We operate through two segments—the Sears Hometown and Hardware segment ("Hometown") and the Sears Outlet segment ("Outlet"). Our Hometown stores are designed to provide our customers with in-store and online access to a wide selection of national brands of home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, sporting goods, and household goods, depending on the particular store. Our Outlet stores are designed to provide in-store and online access to purchase new, one-of-a-kind, out-of-carton, discontinued, obsolete, used, reconditioned, overstocked, and scratched and dented products, collectively "outlet-value products" across a broad assortment of merchandise categories, including home appliances, mattresses, furniture, and lawn and garden equipment at value-oriented prices. See Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about our segments.
The majority of our Hometown stores are operated by our dealers and franchisees. SHO provides brand and marketing support and inventory on consignment. We initiated efforts to franchise Outlet stores in 2012, with the first stores transferred to franchisees during the 2013 fiscal year. Since the second quarter of 2015, franchising of additional Hometown and Outlet stores except to existing Company franchisees has been suspended by the Company. We pay our dealers and franchisees commissions based on their net sales of our inventory that we consign to them. We also authorize our dealers and franchisees to sell post-sale services, such as extended-service plans, for which we also pay commissions.
Hometown
As of February 3, 2018, the Company or our dealers and franchisees operated a total of 768 Sears Hometown and Hardware stores located across all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda.
Our Hometown segment operates through three distinct formats: Sears Hometown Stores ("Hometown Stores"), Sears Hardware Stores ("Hardware Stores"), and Sears Home Appliance Showrooms ("Home Appliance Showrooms"). Each format has its owns website. 

• | Hometown Stores. Our Hometown Stores and website offer products and services across a wide selection of merchandise categories, including home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, sporting goods, and household goods, with the majority of business driven by big-ticket home appliance and lawn and garden sales. Most of our Hometown Stores carry Sears-branded products, including products branded with the KENMORE®, CRAFTSMAN®, and DIEHARD® marks (the "KCD Marks"), and an assortment of other national brands. Primarily independently operated, predominantly located in smaller communities and averaging approximately 8,500 square feet, Hometown Stores are designed to serve trade areas that may not support a full-service big-box retailer. As of February 3, 2018, there were 713 Hometown Stores in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and Bermuda. Hometown Stores also sell products and services through our website www.searshometownstores.com. When a dealer exits a location, the Company may take over the operation of a store, generally on an interim basis, until the location can be transferred to another dealer. At any given time the Company is generally operating a number of stores that are in transition from one dealer to another dealer. Transition stores are not included in our count of Company-operated locations due to the expected short-term nature of transition operation. Dealers operated 706, and we operated seven, Hometown stores. 


• | Hardware Stores. Our Hardware Stores and website offer products and services across a wide selection of merchandise categories with sales primarily driven by home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, and other home improvement products including products typically found in local hardware stores, such as fasteners, electrical supplies, and plumbing supplies. Our Hardware stores average approximately 24,000 square feet in size, are primarily located in suburban trade areas and are positioned as local stores designed to appeal to convenience-oriented customers These stores carry Craftsman brand tools and lawn and garden equipment, and a wide assortment of other national brands and other home improvement 

products. As of February 3, 2018, there were 19 Hardware Stores in 10 states, all of which carry a selection of Kenmore and other national brands of home appliances. Hardware Stores also sell products and services through our website www.searshardwarestores.com. Franchisees operated nine, and we operated ten, of these stores. 

• | Home Appliance Showrooms. Our Home Appliance Showrooms and website offer home appliances and related services in stores primarily located in strip malls and lifestyle centers in metropolitan areas. Averaging 5,000 square feet with a simple, primarily appliance-showroom design, our Home Appliance Showrooms offer quality-focused customers a unique store shopping experience. Home Appliance Showroom sales are primarily driven by home appliances as well as, in certain stores, mattresses. These stores carry Kenmore and other national brands of home appliances. As of February 3, 2018, there were 36 Home Appliance Showrooms in 12 states. Home Appliance Showrooms also sell products and services through our website www.searshomeapplianceshowroom.com. Franchisees operated 23 of these stores, and we operated 13 stores. 

In 2017 revenue from our Hometown segment was $1,177.2 million.
Outlet
Our Sears Outlet stores (the "Outlet Stores") are designed to provide in-store and online access to purchase outlet-value products across a broad assortment of merchandise categories, including home appliances, mattresses, apparel, sporting goods, lawn and garden equipment, tools, and other household goods, including furniture, at prices that are significantly lower than list prices. Outlet Stores serve as a liquidation channel for outlet-value home appliances from major appliance vendors. In 2017 Outlet’s most significant merchandise category was home appliances, which made up 82.2% of our Outlet sales revenue. Outlet-value products are generally covered by a warranty. Outlet Stores also offer a full suite of extended-service plans and services. As of February 3, 2018, Outlet operated 132 locations in 33 states and Puerto Rico, of which all offer a wide range of outlet-value products. Outlet also sells products and services through our website www.searsoutlet.com. As of February 3, 2018, we operated 118 Outlet Stores and franchisees operated 14 Outlet Stores.
In 2017 revenue from our Outlet segment was $542.7 million. 
Competition
Hometown
Our Hometown business is subject to highly competitive conditions, with varying levels of competition in each store’s trade area. Hometown Stores and Hardware Stores compete with a wide variety of retailers handling similar lines of merchandise, including department stores, discounters, mass merchandisers, specialty retailers, wholesale clubs, and many other competitors operating on a national, regional, or local level. Hometown Stores and Hardware Stores also compete with online and catalog businesses that have similar merchandise offerings. Home Appliance Showrooms compete with all of the previously listed competitors to the extent that they sell home appliances.
The key national competitors of the Hometown Stores, the Hardware Stores, and the Home Appliance Showrooms are The Home Depot and Lowe’s, as well as Ace Hardware and True Value for the Hardware Stores, and Tractor Supply for the Hometown Stores and the Hardware Stores, all of which offer consumers lines of merchandise that are the same as or similar to lines of merchandise offered by the Hometown Stores, the Hardware Stores, and the Home Appliance Showrooms. Sears Holdings' stores offer consumers lines of merchandise that are similar to the lines of merchandise offered by the Hometown Stores, the Hardware Stores, and the Home Appliance Showrooms. We believe that, historically, the Hometown Stores, the Hardware Stores, and the Home Appliance Showrooms generally did not compete significantly with Sears Holdings' stores. As our stores have expanded their merchandise offerings, the level of competition between the Hometown Stores, the Hardware Stores, and the Home Appliance Showrooms and Sears Holdings' stores has increased. In addition to being the principal merchandise vendor for the Hometown business, Sears Holdings also continues to provide some e-commerce services and support to SHO, and Sears Holdings' online sales compete with our business.
We believe that the results of operations for our businesses in fiscal 2017 were, and will continue to be, adversely affected by the continuing growth at other retailers of online sales of merchandise in our important product categories, especially home appliances. Our rights to engage in our own online initiatives that would leverage www.sears.com, and our rights to engage on our own terms and conditions in our own online initiatives that would be independent of www.sears.com, were constrained significantly by our agreements with Sears Holdings until those agreements were amended in May 2016, which amendments granted us contractual rights to transactional Hometown websites, subject to various conditions. Our Hometown websites launched in November 2016. The constraints prevented us from conducting and growing our online business during a period of significant growth in that channel. 
1

As a consequence, we believe that the constraints which delayed the launch of our websites adversely impacted our ability to conduct and grow our online business during 2017 and our results of operations during 2017. 
We believe that the key differentiating factors among competitors operating in this industry include price, product assortment and quality, service and convenience, brand recognition, existence of loyalty programs, online and multichannel capabilities and availability of retail-related services such as access to lease-to-own and credit-card programs and product delivery, installation, assembly and repair.
Outlet
The Outlet Stores and searsoutlet.com operate in the highly fragmented outlet-value retail industry. In our primary product category, appliances, our Outlet Stores and searsoutlet.com compete at one end of the spectrum with big-box retailers that sell primarily new, in-box product, as new in-box product competes both with new in-box product and out-of-box product sold in the Outlet Stores. To the extent these big-box competitors choose to liquidate their own out-of-box product on their sales floors, this product would compete directly with out-of-box product sold in the Outlet Stores. At the other end of the spectrum are the locally owned appliance retailers that have historically comprised the bulk of the Outlet Stores' direct competition for sales of out-of-box product. These locally owned appliance retailers generally sell both out-of-box and new in-box appliances. Online retailers that sell new or out-of-box appliances are also competitors.
The Outlet Stores' key national competitors with respect to new, in-box appliances are The Home Depot and Lowe’s. With respect to as-is appliances, which represent 61% of the Outlet segment's 2017 sales, there are no national competitors.   In addition, as we continue to expand our product lines into categories such as mattresses and furniture, we expect to face additional competition from other discount retailers that focus on those product categories. While Sears Holdings' stores provide similar lines of merchandise as the Outlet Stores, the Outlet Stores are primarily value-price sellers of distressed, refurbished, and marked-out-of-stock merchandise, which merchandise Sears Holdings' stores generally do not sell in what we believe are significant volumes to consumers. Consequently, we believe that, historically, the Outlet Stores have not competed significantly with Sears Holdings' stores. As our Outlet business expands its merchandise offerings (for example, our recent increased emphasis on mattresses and furniture), the level of competition between the Outlet Stores and Sears Holdings' stores may increase.
We believe that the key differentiating factor between competitors operating in the outlet-value retail industry is price. Other factors include product assortment and quality, service and convenience, brand recognition, existence of loyalty programs, online and multichannel capabilities, and availability of retail-related services such as access to credit and product delivery.
Our Strengths
We believe that our competitive strengths are the following:
Our stores carry a wide variety of well-known, brand-name merchandise.
We offer our customers a broad selection of products, including well-known consumer brand names such as Kenmore, Whirlpool®, Samsung, and Craftsman, and we strive to offer high in-stock levels. Our Hometown stores are the only national retail chain that carries the top 10 brands for home appliances. This ability to offer a wide variety of well-known, consumer brand-name merchandise enables us to remain competitive in our trade areas and to continue to attract customers. 
We operate across the nation through distinctly tailored store formats.
Our different store formats are targeted to the trade areas in which they compete. Our Hometown Stores offer customers in more rural communities a wide variety of merchandise. In those trade areas, we compete against larger national or regional big-box stores on the basis of the convenient shopping experience we provide, and we compete against local independent stores based on our product offerings and competitive pricing.
Our Hardware Stores are located in neighborhood centers in suburban areas where customers can fulfill their hardware, lawn and garden and home appliance needs. These stores compete against larger warehouse home centers and smaller local hardware stores by offering a broad assortment of products, convenient outlets, and personalized customer assistance.
Our Home Appliance Showrooms include appealing display floors in metropolitan trade areas where we compete with big-box retailers by offering a compelling service model, a wide assortment of brand-name home appliances, significant online and multi-channel capabilities, and convenient locations. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing our customers with a consultative and educational purchase experience.
Our Outlet Stores offer customers a wide range of outlet-value products at locations across the United States and Puerto Rico. 
2

Our Outlet Stores differentiate themselves from their competitors by providing a wide range of outlet-value brand-name products, including Kenmore, Whirlpool, GE, LG, Maytag, and Samsung products, at prices that are significantly lower than list prices.
In addition, SHO has stores located in all 50 states as well as Puerto Rico and Bermuda, with over 98% of sales in the United States. The ability to generate revenues with a wide variety of products across a diversified mix of regions and trade areas positions us to be able to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
The fact that our Hometown Stores are primarily operated by dealers allows us to leverage their knowledge, experience, motivation, and capital.
Our Hometown Stores are primarily owned and operated by individual dealers. Under both our dealer model and our franchise model, SHO provides inventory (on a consignment basis), branding, and marketing to the stores and the dealer or franchisee is responsible for start-up costs, lease payments, and other operating costs including payroll. Our dealer and franchise models allow us to leverage the entrepreneurial spirit of our dealers and franchisees and their local trade-area knowledge to better serve their customers. In addition, these models free up capital and enable us to focus on strategic planning, marketing, and pricing strategies. We regularly evaluate the performance of franchised and dealer stores and require compliance with established customer service and other operational guidelines.
Our Outlet Stores are the leading liquidation channel of value-priced home appliances.
As the nation’s largest chain retailer of outlet-value home appliances, our Outlet business has become increasingly relevant to major appliance vendors as a liquidation channel for outlet-value appliances. We do not believe that we have any national competitors for outlet-value appliances. 
Our Strategy
We plan to continue to enhance our competitive position, grow our business, and increase our net sales and profitability by implementing the following strategies:
Expand Product Assortment and Optimize Service Offerings. 
We strive to provide our customers with complete solutions for their home appliance, lawn and garden, hardware, and other related home needs. We regularly evaluate other merchandise categories and types of services to enhance our product and service offerings and to create cross-selling opportunities for adjacent products and services. For example, our initiatives to increase product offerings include expanding furniture in our Outlet Stores and adding mattresses in our Home Appliance Showrooms.
Promote Customer Growth through Enhanced Marketing, Improved Customer Experience, and Integrated Multi-Channel Capabilities. 
We seek to serve our customers’ needs and drive revenue growth through our integrated multi-channel sale capabilities. We launched e-commerce capabilities for our Hometown segment and we continue to seek to enhance our e-commerce operations and our online product selection to improve our customers’ online shopping experiences. We seek to integrate our online business and our brick-and-mortar stores to provide our customers with a seamless shopping experience across channels. On Company-operated websites we offer our customers the option to purchase items online and pick them up in our local stores as well as order out-of-stock and other items from our in-store kiosks. In addition, Sears.com offers customers the option to purchase items online and pick them up in our local stores. These capabilities allow us to better serve customers across various channels and improve sales. See, however, "We rely on Sears Holdings for services related to our online business and the processing of online orders" in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We also plan to drive customer growth by refining our marketing initiatives. We believe that we can grow our customer base through advertising in a number of different media, particularly through various forms of digital marketing, including search, social media ads and email marketing. We launched a fully integrated print, digital and television marketing campaign in March 2018 to highlight the unique market position of the Hometown Stores and our strengths in the home appliances category. This includes the Company’s first ever national television commercials. 
We believe that quality customer service contributes to increased store visits and purchases by our customers. We are focused on building long-term relationships with customers and members by improving their in-store and post-sale experiences. We conduct quality control checks of our store managers and sales associates and our dealers and franchisees to improve the quality of customer interaction and product knowledge in the stores we operate and the stores operated by our dealers and franchisees. We continue to improve and augment our post-sale engagement with customers through access to delivery, assembly, and installation services as well as extended-service plans.

Diversify Our Supply Chain. We intend to continue our efforts to diversify our network of merchandise suppliers and service providers. Such diversification, particularly with respect to merchandise suppliers, is intended to reduce our reliance on Sears Holdings for our inventory. In 2017, we leveraged new systems functionality, enabled by our investments in the IT systems transformation initiative, to enhance our merchandise sourcing and inventory management capabilities. We have established direct purchasing relationships with several of our key strategic product manufacturers which hold significant market share in the product categories we compete in across the industry. SHO's purchases of inventory from Sears Holdings declined to 78% of total purchases in 2017 compared to 80% in 2016. We expect the percentage of total purchases of inventory acquired from subsidiaries of Sears Holdings to decrease in the future as we increase our direct purchases from other merchandise vendors.
Provide Industry-Leading Financing Options. We intend to continue to provide our customers many convenient methods of financing their purchases including extended credit-card offers and lease-to-own alternatives. We believe that our store operating practices and our relationships with the issuer of the Sears credit card and our lease-to-own provider allow us to offer attractive financing choices for our customers that we believe will lead to higher customer loyalty and profitability for the Company. Year-over-year leasing comparable store sales increased 105% in fiscal 2017. Our leasing share of the total business more than doubled versus the prior year, growing to 6.2% share in the 2017. Additionally, third-party commissions received on leasing sales became a more meaningful contributor to our margin improvement.
Grow Commercial Sales. We are seeking to continue to grow our revenue with business customers who can benefit from our extensive merchandise offerings, broad store network, and delivery and service capabilities. Businesses such as builders, landlords, and apartment operators represent an attractive incremental customer base in the communities where we operate. In 2017, commercial sales grew 23%. Gross margin rate, net of commissions paid, improved as a result of a more disciplined commercial pricing process. Dealer and franchisee adoption of the program also continued to grow, with 52% of stores participating in 2017 versus 42% in 2016.
Transform our IT Infrastructure. We are replacing the large majority of our information technology infrastructure, which has been provided by Sears Holdings since the Separation, with new systems and processes. We expect this change will provide much greater strategic and operational flexibility, allow better control of our systems and processes, and reduce some of the risks relating to our relationship with, and dependence on, Sears Holdings. See also "We rely on Sears Holdings and other third parties to provide us with key products and services in connection with the administration of many critical aspects of our business, and we may be required to develop our own systems quickly in order to reduce such dependence" in Part 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the conversion and migration of our information technology infrastructure.
Improve Operating Performance. We plan to focus on various initiatives intended to improve our gross margins and our inventory management. Our inventory-procurement operations are focused on developing customized merchandise assortments based on store demographics, sales history, customer preferences and margin by product division. Our inventory management focuses on rightsizing total inventory investment to each store's turnover as well as seeking to keep the products with higher customer demand in stock. In addition, we intend to focus on controlling costs across our business lines, particularly selling and administrative expenses.
Store Activity. We will continue to take proactive steps to make the best use of capital and reduce costs by closing stores that we determine are not sufficiently profitable. We will also continue to selectively identify trade-area opportunities for new stores over the long term based on market potential, including trade areas where Sears Holdings has closed a full-line department store. 
Our Products and Suppliers
Our focus on the preferences of our customers drives our merchandise selection. Our goal is to offer our customers a selection of brands and products within each of our product categories. Our largest revenue-generating category in 2017 was home appliances, representing approximately 73% of net sales.
We are party to an Amended and Restated Merchandising Agreement (as amended, the "Merchandising Agreement") with Sears Holdings, Kmart Corporation, ("Kmart") and Sears, Roebuck and Co. ("SRC") (Kmart and SRC are wholly owned subsidiaries of Sears Holdings) pursuant to which Kmart and SRC (1) sell to us, with respect to certain specified product categories, Sears-branded products (including products branded with the KCD Marks ("KCD Products")) and vendor-branded products obtained from Kmart’s and SRC’s vendors and suppliers and (2) grant us licenses to use the trademarks owned by Kmart, SRC or other subsidiaries of Sears Holdings, including the KCD Marks, in connection with the marketing and sale of products sold under the Sears marks. The initial term of the Merchandising Agreement will expire February 1, 2020 with our right to exercise one three-year extension with respect to KCD Products subject to specified Sears Holdings termination rights and other conditions in the Merchandising Agreement. We expect that our Hometown business will continue to rely on Sears Holdings for a significant majority of its inventory in 2018.

For the year ended February 3, 2018, products that we acquired through Sears Holdings accounted for approximately 78% of SHO's merchandise purchases. Although most merchandise purchases are sourced through Sears Holdings, this percentage decreased from 80% in 2016. We expect this percentage to continue to decline as we fully operationalize more direct purchasing agreements. For example, fourth quarter 2017 purchases from Sears Holdings accounted for 74% of total purchases compared to 84% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 76% in the third quarter of 2017. During the second half of 2017 and in early 2018, we entered into direct purchasing agreements with Whirlpool Corp., Husqvarna, LG Electronics USA Inc., GE Appliances, Samsung Electronics America Inc., and Stanley, Black and Decker. We did not purchase merchandise under several of these agreements until 2018. Our Outlet business primarily relies on suppliers other than Sears Holdings for a significant portion of its inventory. For the year ended February 3, 2018, products that we acquired through Sears Holdings accounted for approximately 31% of total Outlet purchases.
As described in greater detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report 1A, we have entered into agreements with Sears Holdings, as well as with third-party service providers, to provide processing and administrative functions over a broad range of areas.
Our Dealer and Franchise Models
Dealer Model
As of February 3, 2018, 707 of our Hometown Stores were operated by independent authorized dealers who own and operate their stores. The dealer bears responsibility for store operating costs, including all payroll and occupancy costs. SHO provides the inventory to the dealer on a consignment basis, and the dealer earns a variable commission on sales of merchandise, extended-service plans, and other services. SHO also provides support to dealers for recruiting and training dealer staff, marketing, and other support services.
The dealer relationship is governed by a dealer agreement, which generally has either a three or five-year term (depending on its terms and conditions). If a dealer defaults or fails to renew its dealer agreement, SHO may assume responsibility for the operation of the store until a new dealer is recruited to operate the store.
Franchise Model
As of February 3, 2018, 23 of our Home Appliance Showrooms, 9 of our Hardware Stores, and 11 of our Outlet Stores were operated by independent franchisees. Under our primary franchise model, the franchisee operates the store and is responsible for its operating costs, including payroll and leasing costs. SHO provides inventory to the franchisee on a consignment basis, and the franchisee earns variable commissions on sales of merchandise, extended-service plans, and other services. SHO also provides brand and marketing services to the franchisee. In certain cases, SHO remains responsible for lease costs in the case of a default by the franchisees until the expiration of the leases, at which time our franchisees may be required to negotiate new leases to which SHO will not be a party.
The franchise relationship is governed by a franchise agreement with each franchisee that generally has a ten-year term and includes the franchisee's right to extend the term for an additional five years subject to the franchisee's satisfaction of renewal conditions that are specified in the franchise agreement. The franchise agreement also currently obligates the franchisee to pay to SHO specified fees, including an initial franchise fee, training fees, transfer fees, and successor franchise fees.
Since the second quarter of 2015, franchising of additional Hometown and Outlet stores except to existing Company franchisees has been suspended by the Company. 
Distribution and Systems Infrastructure
The majority of our merchandise comes to our stores directly from vendors or distributors (including Sears Holdings) through our agreements with Sears Holdings. Home delivery is provided by the selling dealers and franchisees, by Sears Holdings, and by other parties.
We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results, and manage our business. Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware and software systems. We currently rely on Sears Holdings to provide us with the computer systems and infrastructure that enable our distribution systems. See "If we do not maintain the security of our customer, associate, and company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation" in
