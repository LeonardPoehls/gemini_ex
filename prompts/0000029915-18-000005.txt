ITEM 1. BUSINESS
THE CORPORATION
Union Carbide Corporation is a chemicals and polymers company that has been a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company ("Dow") since 2001. Except as otherwise indicated by the context, the terms "Corporation" or "UCC" as used herein mean Union Carbide Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Effective August 31, 2017, pursuant to the merger of equals transaction contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 11, 2015, as amended on March 31, 2017, Dow and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company ("DuPont") each merged with subsidiaries of DowDuPont Inc. ("DowDuPont") and, as a result, Dow and DuPont became subsidiaries of DowDuPont (the "Merger"). See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
Dow conducts its worldwide operations through principal product groups, and the Corporation's business activities comprise components of Dow's principal product groups rather than stand-alone operations. Because there are no separable reportable business segments for UCC and no detailed business information is provided to a chief operating decision maker regarding the Corporation's stand-alone operations, the Corporation's results are reported as a single operating segment. In addition, in order to simplify the customer interface process, the Corporation sells substantially all its products to Dow. Products are sold to Dow at market-based prices, in accordance with the terms of Dow's intercompany pricing policies.
