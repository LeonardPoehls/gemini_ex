ITEM 1.          BUSINESS
Overview
We seek to provide a significant return for our shareholders by acquiring and managing a portfolio of companies, products, royalty agreements and debt facilities in the biotech, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. In 2012, we began providing alternative sources of capital through royalty monetizations and debt facilities, and in 2016, we began acquiring commercial-stage products and launching specialized companies dedicated to the commercialization of these products. To date, we have consummated 16 of such transactions. Of these transactions, five have concluded with an average annual internal rate of return of 18.4%: Merus Labs International, Inc., Durata Therapeutics, Inc., AxoGen, Inc., Avinger, Inc. and Paradigm Spine, LLC. We have four debt transactions outstanding, representing deployed and committed capital of $269.0 million and $309.0 million, respectively: CareView Communications, Inc., kaléo, Inc., Direct Flow Medical, Inc. and LENSAR, Inc.; we have one hybrid royalty/debt transaction outstanding, representing deployed and committed capital of $44.0 million: Wellstat Diagnostics, LLC; and we have six royalty transactions outstanding, representing deployed and committed capital of $496.1 million and $537.1 million, respectively: KYBELLA®, AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., The Regents of the University of Michigan, Viscogliosi Brothers, LLC and Depomed, Inc.. Our equity and loan investments in Noden Pharma DAC and Noden Pharma USA, Inc. (together “Noden”) represents deployed and committed capital of $110.0 million and $202.0 million, respectively.
In connection with our acquisition of Tekturna through Noden, described in more detail below under the heading “Product Sales-Noden Purchase Agreement,” in July 2016, we began operating in two reportable segments: income generating assets and product sales. Our income generating assets segment consists of royalties from issued patents in the United States and elsewhere, covering the humanization of antibodies, which we refer to as the Queen et al. patents; notes and other long-term receivables, royalty rights - at fair value and equity investments. Our product sales segment consists of revenue derived from Tekturna®, Tekturna HCT®, Rasilez® and Rasilez HCT® (collectively, the “Noden Products” or “Tekturna”) sales. Prospectively, we expect to focus on the acquisition of additional products and expect to transact fewer royalty transactions and still fewer debt transactions. We anticipate that over time more of our revenues will come from our product sales segment and less of our revenues will come from our income generating assets segment.

Financial information about our operations, including our revenues and net income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, and our total assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Product Sales
We recently began acquiring, and plan to continue to acquire, commercial-stage products and companies who own or are acquiring pharmaceutical products. Our investment objective with respect to these transactions is to maximize our portfolio’s total return by generating current income from product sales. We consummated our first investment of this type with Tekturna in July 2016.
Noden Purchase Agreement
On July 1, 2016, Noden Pharma DAC, entered into an asset purchase agreement (“Noden Purchase Agreement”) where by it purchased from Novartis Pharma AG (“Novartis”) the exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, market, and sell the branded prescription medicine product sold under the name Tekturna® and Tekturna HCT® in the United States and Rasilez® and Rasilez HCT® in the rest of the world (collectively the “Noden Products”) and certain related assets and assumed certain related liabilities (the “Noden Transaction”). Upon the consummation of the Noden Transaction, a noncontrolling interest holder acquired 6% equity interest in Noden. The equity interest of the noncontrolling interest holder is subject to vesting and repurchase rights over a four-year period. At December 31, 2016, 80% of the noncontrolling interest was subject to repurchase. We determined that Noden shall be consolidated under the voting interest model as of December 31, 2016.
Tekturna (or Rasilez outside the United States) contains aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, for the treatment of hypertension. While indicated as a first line treatment, it is more commonly used as a third line treatment in those patients who are intolerant of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (“ACEs”) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (“ARBs”). It is not indicated for use with ACEs and ARBs in patients with diabetes or renal impairment. Tekturna HCT (or Rasilez HCT outside the United States) is a combination of aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, for the treatment of hypertension in patients not adequately controlled by monotherapy and as an initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals. It is not indicated for use with ACEs and ARBs in patient with diabetes or renal impairment and not for use in patients with known anuria or hypersensitivity to sulfonamide derived drugs. Studies indicate that approximately 12% of hypertension patients are ACE/ARB inhibitor-intolerant. Tekturna and Tekturna HCT are contraindicated for use by pregnant women.
The agreement between Novartis and Noden provides for various transition periods for development and commercialization activities relating to the Noden Products. Initially, Novartis will continue to distribute the four products on behalf of Noden worldwide and Noden will receive a profit split on such sales. In the United States, the duration of the profit split ran from July 1, 2016 through October 4, 2016. Outside the United States, the profit split is expected to run from July 1, 2016 through approximately March 31, 2017. The event that terminates the profit split arrangement is the transfer of the marketing authorization for the four products from Novartis to Noden. Generally, the profit split to Noden is defined as gross revenues less product cost, a low single digit percentage as a fee to Novartis and the applicable rebates, trade discounts, returns, etc. Prior to the transfer of the marketing authorization, revenue will be recognized on a “net” basis; after the transfer of the marketing authorization, revenue will be recognized on a “gross” basis.
Because Novartis has not actively commercialized the four products for a number of years, and sales of the four products have been declining annually since that time, the ability of Noden to promote these four products successfully and efficiently will determine whether revenues can be stabilized and grown.
Income Generating Assets
We acquire income generating assets when such assets can be acquired on terms that we believe allow us to increase return to our stockholders. These income generating assets are typically in the form of notes receivables, royalty rights and hybrid notes/royalties receivable and in some cases, equity. We primarily focus our income generating asset acquisition strategy on commercial-stage therapies and medical devices having strong economic fundamentals. However, we do not expect that our acquired income generating assets will, in the near term, replace completely the revenues we generated from our license agreements related to our Queen et al. patents. In the second quarter of 2016, our revenues materially decreased after we stopped receiving payments from certain Queen et al. patent licenses and legal settlements, which accounted for 68%, 82% and 83% of our 2016, 2015 and 2014 revenues.
4

Royalties from Queen et al. patents
While the Queen et al. patents have expired and the resulting royalty revenue has dropped substantially since the first quarter of 2016, we continue to receive royalty revenue from one product under the Queen et al. patent licenses, Tysabri®, as a result of sales of licensed product that was manufactured prior to patent expiry.
Notes and Other Long-Term Receivables
We have entered, and may continue to enter, into credit agreements with borrowers across the healthcare industry, under which we make available cash loans to be used by the borrower. Obligations under these credit agreements are typically secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of the borrower and any of its subsidiaries. While we currently maintain this portfolio of notes receivable, our intention is to pursue fewer debt transactions, and focus on acquiring additional specialty pharmaceutical products or companies.
At December 31, 2016, we had a total of five notes receivable transactions outstanding and one note/royalty (hybrid) receivable transaction outstanding. The most significant investments are summarized below:
CareView
Deal Summary
In July 2015, we entered into a credit agreement with CareView Communications Inc. (“CareView”), under which we made available to CareView up to $40.0 million in two tranches of $20.0 million each.

Principal repayment will commence on the ninth quarterly interest payment date of each tranche of loans. The principal amount outstanding at commencement of repayment will be repaid in equal installments until final maturity of the loans. In addition, we have a security interest in substantially all of CareView’s assets.
In October 2015, we funded the first tranche of $20.0 million, net of fees. The additional $20.0 million in the form of a second tranche continues to be available upon CareView’s attainment of specified milestones relating to the placement of CareView Systems and Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement), to be accomplished no later than June 30, 2017.

kaléo
Deal Summary
In April 2014, we entered into a note purchase agreement with Accel 300 LLC (“Accel 300”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of kaléo, Inc. (“kaléo”), pursuant to which we acquired $150.0 million of secured notes due 2029. The secured notes were issued pursuant to an indenture between Accel 300 and U.S. Bank, National Association, as trustee, and are secured by 20% of net sales of its first approved product, Auvi-Q® (epinephrine auto-injection, USP) (known as Allerject™ in Canada), and 10% of net sales of kaléo’s second proprietary auto-injector based product, EVZIO (naloxone hydrochloride injection), and a pledge of kaléo’s equity ownership in Accel 300. The notes carry interest at 13% per annum, paid quarterly in arrears on principal outstanding. kaléo may redeem the notes at any time, subject to a redemption premium.
In March 2016, sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC (“Sanofi US”) and kaléo terminated their license and development agreement. All U.S. and Canadian commercial and manufacturing rights to Auvi-Q and Allerject™ were returned to kaléo. On February 14, 2017, kaléo reintroduced Auvi-Q to the U.S. market.
As of December 31, 2016, kaléo had a principal balance of $144.8 million due to us. kaléo continued to make interest payments due to us under the note purchase agreement while Auvi-Q was not marketed.

Direct Flow Medical
Deal Summary
In November 2013, we entered into a credit agreement with Direct Flow Medical, Inc. (“Direct Flow Medical”) under which we agreed to provide up to $50.0 million to Direct Flow Medical, to be used to refinance its existing credit facility and fund the commercialization of its transcatheter aortic valve system used to treat aortic stenosis. An initial $35.0 million was funded at the close of the transaction, with the remaining $15.0 million to be funded upon the achievement of a specified milestone. We funded the $15.0 million second tranche to Direct Flow Medical, net of fees in November 2014. Outstanding borrowings under the first tranche bore interest at the rate of 15.5% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. Upon occurrence of the borrowing of this second tranche, the interest rate applicable to all loans under the credit agreement was decreased to 13.5% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. 
The obligations under the credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of Direct Flow Medical and any of its subsidiaries.
In January 2016, we funded an additional $5.0 million to Direct Flow Medical in the form of a short-term secured promissory note that was converted into a loan under the credit agreement with substantially the same interest and payment terms as the existing loans. Subsequently in July, September and November 2016, we advanced additional loans of $1.5 million, $1.5 million, and $1.0 million respectively, as Direct Flow Medical sought to obtain an equity financing. On November 16, 2016, Direct Flow Medical advised us that its potential financing source had modified its proposal from an equity investment to a loan with a substantially smaller amount and under less favorable terms. Direct Flow Medical shut down its operations in December 2016 and in January 2017 made an assignment for the benefit of creditors. We then initiated foreclosure proceedings, which have since concluded, resulting in our obtaining ownership of most of the Direct Flow Medical assets through our wholly-owned subsidiary, DFM, LLC.
In January 2017, we and DFM, LLC entered into an Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement with Hong Kong Haisco Pharmaceutical Co., Limited (“Haisco”), a Chinese pharmaceutical company, whereby Haisco acquired former Direct Flow Medical clinical, regulatory and commercial information and intellectual property rights exclusively in China for $7.0 million.

LENSAR
Deal Summary
In October 2013, we entered into a credit agreement with LENSAR, Inc. (“LENSAR”) under which we made available to LENSAR up to $60.0 million to be used by LENSAR in connection with the commercialization of its currently marketed LENSAR™ Laser System. Of the $60.0 million available to LENSAR, an initial $40.0 million was funded by us at the close of the transaction. The remaining $20.0 million in the form of a second tranche is no longer available to LENSAR under the terms of the credit agreement. Outstanding borrowings under the loans bore interest at the rate of 15.5% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. The obligations under the credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of LENSAR.
In May 2015, we entered into a forbearance agreement with LENSAR as a result of LENSAR’s failure to comply with a liquidity covenant and make interest payments due under the credit agreement. Between May and December 2015, we provided additional funding to LENSAR.
6

In December 2015, LENSAR, LLC (“LENSAR/Alphaeon”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphaeon Corporation (“Alphaeon”), acquired certain assets of LENSAR and assumed $42.0 million in loans as part of the borrowings under our prior credit agreement with LENSAR. In addition, Alphaeon issued 1.7 million shares of its Class A common stock to us.
In December 2016, LENSAR, re-acquired the assets from Alphaeon and we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with LENSAR whereby LENSAR assumed all obligations outstanding under the credit agreement with LENSAR/Alphaeon. Also in December 2016, LENSAR filed, with our support, a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (“Chapter 11 case”). In January 2017, we agreed to provide debtor-in-possession financing of up to $2.8 million to LENSAR so that it can continue to operate its business during the remainder of the Chapter 11 case. LENSAR has filed a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization with our support under which, subject to bankruptcy court approval, it is expected that LENSAR will issue equity securities to us in exchange for a portion of our claims in the Chapter 11 case and will become one of our operating subsidiaries. We estimate that the bankruptcy proceeding will be concluded in the second quarter of 2017.

Wellstat
Deal Summary
In March 2012, we executed a $7.5 million two-year senior secured note receivable with the holders of the equity interests in Wellstat Diagnostics, LLC a/k/a Defined Diagnostics, LLC (“Wellstat Diagnostics”). In August 2012, we and Wellstat Diagnostics amended the note receivable, providing a senior secured note receivable of $10.0 million, bearing interest at 12% per annum, to replace the original $7.5 million note receivable. This $10.0 million note receivable was repaid on November 2, 2012, using the proceeds of the $40.0 million credit facility we entered into on the same date.
In November 2012, we entered into a $40.0 million credit agreement with Wellstat Diagnostics pursuant to which we were to accrue quarterly interest payments at the rate of 5% per annum. In January 2013, Wellstat Diagnostics defaulted on the credit agreement, and as a result both parties agreed to enter into a forbearance agreement whereby we agreed to provide additional funding. In August 2013, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with terms substantially the same as those of the original credit agreement. However, pursuant to the amended and restated credit agreement: (i) the principal amount was reset to approximately $44.1 million.

Royalty Rights - At Fair Value
We have entered into various royalty purchase agreements with counterparties, whereby the counterparty conveys to us the right to receive royalties that are typically payable on sales revenue generated by the sale, distribution or other use of the counterparties’ products. Certain of our royalty agreements provide the counterparty with the right to repurchase the royalty rights at any time for a specified amount.
7

We record the royalty rights at fair value using discounted cash flows related to the expected future cash flows to be received. We use significant judgment in determining our valuation inputs, including estimates as to the probability and timing of future sales of the licensed product. A third-party expert is generally engaged to assist us with the development of our estimate of the expected future cash flows. The estimated fair value of the asset is subject to variation should those cash flows vary significantly from our estimates. At each reporting period, an evaluation is performed to assess those estimates, discount rates utilized and general market conditions affecting fair market value.
While we currently maintain this portfolio of royalty rights, our intention is to pursue fewer of these transactions while we focus on acquiring additional specialty pharmaceutical products or companies.
At December 31, 2016, we had a total of six royalty rights transactions outstanding, which are summarized below:
KYBELLA
Deal Summary
In July 2016, we entered into a royalty purchase and sales agreement with an individual, whereby we acquired the individual’s rights to receive certain royalties on sales of KYBELLA by Allergan, Plc in exchange for a $9.5 million cash payment and up to $1.0 million in future milestone payments based upon achieving specified product sales targets. We started to receive royalty payments during the third quarter of 2016.

AcelRx
Deal Summary
In September 2015, we entered into a royalty interest assignment agreement (the “AcelRx Royalty Agreement”) with ARPI LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“AcelRx”), whereby we acquired a portion of the royalties on expected sales of Zalviso™ (sufentanil sublingual tablet system) in the European Union, Switzerland and Australia by AcelRx’s commercial partner, Grünenthal. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid AcelRx $65.0 million, and in exchange, we will receive 75% of the royalties AcelRx receives from Grünenthal as well as 80% of the first four commercial milestone payments, until the earlier of occur of (i) receipt by us of payments equal to three times the cash payments made to AcelRx and (ii) the expiration of the licensed patents. We believe that the applicable patents run until January 2032. Zalviso received marketing approval by the European Commission in September 2015. Grünenthal launched Zalviso in the second quarter of 2016 and we started to receive royalties in the third quarter of 2016.

ARIAD
Deal Summary
In July 2015, we entered into the revenue interest assignment agreement (the “ARIAD Royalty Agreement”) with ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“ARIAD”), whereby we agreed to provide ARIAD with up to $200.0 million in revenue interest financing in exchange for royalties based on the net revenues of Iclusig® (ponatinib). The purchase price of $100.0 million was payable in two tranches of $50.0 million each, with the first tranche having been funded on July 28, 2015 and the second tranche having been funded on July 28, 2016. Prior to the amendment as discussed below. ARIAD had an option to draw up to an additional $100.0 million at any time between the sixth and twelfth month anniversaries of the closing date.
8

Under the terms of the ARIAD Royalty Agreement, we initially received 2.5% of the worldwide net revenues of Iclusig until the one-year anniversary of the closing date, at which time the royalty increased to 5.0% of the worldwide net revenues of Iclusig and remains until December 31, 2018. Beginning January 1, 2019 and thereafter, the royalty rate will increase to 6.5%, subject to an additional increase to 7.5% if our funding exceeds $150 million. If we do not receive payments equal to or greater than the total amount funded on or before the fifth anniversary of each of the respective funding dates, ARIAD will pay us the difference between the amounts funded by us and the amounts paid to such date. In the event of certain shortfall, we may also receive royalties on brigatinib, a product for which ARIAD has filed for approval in the United States and European Unions. 
In May 2016, ARIAD entered into a share purchase agreement with Incyte Corporation (“Incyte”), pursuant to which ARIAD sold to Incyte all of the outstanding shares of ARIAD Pharmaceuticals (Luxembourg) S.a.r.l., which is the parent company of ARIAD’s European subsidiaries responsible for the commercialization of Iclusig in the European Union and certain other countries.
In May 2016, we and ARIAD amended the ARIAD Royalty Agreement to, among other things, include the net sales of Iclusig made by Incyte Corporation in the amount payable to us after its acquisition of ARIAD’s commercialization operations with respect to Iclusig in the European Union and certain other countries. In addition, we agreed to restructure future funding under the ARIAD Royalty Agreement such that ARIAD’s option to draw up to an additional $100.0 million between January and July of 2016 was reduced to a maximum amount of up to an additional $40.0 million, which would be funded at ARIAD’s option in July of 2017. The amendment to the ARIAD Royalty Agreement did not affect our obligation to fund the second tranche of $50.0 million on the first anniversary of the ARIAD Royalty Agreement, which was funded in July 2016.
We have a put option based upon certain events, including a change of control at ARIAD, and ARIAD has a call option to repurchase the revenue interest at any time. Both the put and call prices have been pre-determined. In January 2017, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”) announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ARIAD. The acquisition was consummated on February, 16, 2017 and we exercised our put option on the same day, which will result in a payment to us of a 1.2x multiple of the $100.0 million funded by us under the ARIAD Royalty Agreement, less royalty payments already received by us. We have received $9.3 million of royalty payments through December 31, 2016.

Equity Investments
In addition to credit and royalty agreements, we make equity investments in healthcare companies. For example, we have acquired warrants to purchase equity interests in connection with certain of our existing notes receivable transactions. Our investment objective with respect to these equity investments is to maximize our portfolio total return by generating current income from capital appreciation. Our primary business objectives are to increase our net income, net operating income and asset value by investing in warrants and equity of companies with the potential for equity appreciation and realized gains.
Intellectual Property
Patents
We have been issued patents in the United States and elsewhere, covering the humanization of antibodies, which we refer to as our Queen et al. patents. Our Queen et al. patents, for which final patent expiry was in December 2014, covered, among other things, humanized antibodies, methods for humanizing antibodies, polynucleotide encoding in humanized antibodies and methods of producing humanized antibodies.
Our U.S. patent No. 5,693,761 (the “761 Patent”), which expired on December 2, 2014, covered methods and materials used in the manufacture of humanized antibodies. In addition to covering methods and materials used in the manufacture of humanized antibodies, coverage under our ‘761 Patent typically extended to the use or sale of compositions made with those methods and/or materials. Our European patent no. 0 451 216B (the “216B Patent”) expired in Europe in December 2009. We have been granted Supplementary Protection Certificates (“SPCs”) for the Avastin®, Herceptin®, Lucentis®, Xolair® and Tysabri® products in many of the jurisdictions in the European Union in connection with the ‘216B Patent. The SPCs effectively extended our patent protection with respect to Avastin, Herceptin, Lucentis, Xolair and Tysabri generally until December 2014, except that the SPCs for Herceptin expired in July 2014. Because SPCs are granted on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, the duration of the extension varies slightly in certain jurisdictions. Our revenue from payments made from the Queen et al. patents license and settlement materially decreased in the second quarter of 2016, with only revenue from Tysabri being recognized after such period.
Tekturna is protected by multiple patents worldwide, which specifically cover the composition of matter, the pharmaceutical formulations and methods of production. In the United States, the FDA Orange Book lists one patent, U.S. patent No. 5,559,111 (the “111 Patent”), which covers compositions of matter comprising aliskiren. The ‘111 Patent expires on July 21, 2018 unless a pediatric extension is granted, in which case it will expire on January 21, 2019. In addition, the FDA Orange Book for Tekturna lists U.S. Patent No. 8,617,595, which covers certain compositions comprising aliskiren, together with other formulation components, and will expire on February 19, 2026. The FDA Orange Book for Tekturna HCT lists U.S. patent No. 8,618,172, which covers certain compositions comprising aliskiren, together with other formulation components, and will expire on July 13, 2028. In Europe, European patent No. 678 503B (the “503B Patent”) expired in 2015. However, numerous SPCs have been granted which are based on the 503B Patent and which will provide for extended protection. These SPCs generally expire in April of 2020.
Licensing Agreements

We have entered into licensing agreements under our Queen et al. patents with numerous entities that are independently developing or have developed humanized antibodies. Although the Queen et al. patents and related rights have expired, we are entitled under our license agreements to continue to receive royalties in certain instances based on net sales of products that were made prior to but sold after patent expiry. In addition, we are entitled to royalties based on know-how provided to a licensee. In general, these agreements cover antibodies targeting antigens specified in the license agreements. Under our licensing agreements, we are entitled to receive a flat-rate royalty based upon our licensees’ net sales of covered antibodies.
Our total revenues from licensees under our Queen et al. patents were $166.2 million, $485.2 million and $486.9 million, net of rebates and foreign exchange hedge adjustments, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Licensing Agreements for Marketed Products
In the year ended December 31, 2016, we received royalties on sales of the seven humanized antibody products listed below, all of which are currently approved for use by the FDA and other regulatory agencies outside the United States.

Licensee | Product Names
Genentech | Avastin 
 | Herceptin 
 | Xolair 
 | Lucentis 
 | Perjeta® 
 | Kadcyla® 
Biogen | Tysabri 

Genentech
We entered into a master patent license agreement, effective September 25, 1998, under which we granted Genentech, Inc. (“Genentech”) a license under our Queen et al. patents to make, use and sell certain antibody products.
On January 31, 2014, we entered into the Settlement Agreement with Genentech and F. Hoffman LaRoche, Ltd. (“Roche”) (“Settlement Agreement”) that resolved all existing legal disputes between the parties.
The Settlement Agreement precluded Genentech and Roche from challenging the validity of our patents, including our SPCs in Europe, from contesting their obligation to pay royalties to us, from contesting patent coverage for Avastin, Herceptin, Lucentis, Xolair, Perjeta, Kadcyla and Gazyva (collectively, the “Genentech Products”) and from assisting or encouraging any third party in challenging our patents and SPCs. The Settlement Agreement further outlined the conduct of any audits initiated by us of the books and records of Genentech in an effort to ensure a full and fair audit procedure. Finally, the Settlement Agreement clarified that the sales amounts from which the royalties are calculated do not include certain taxes and discounts. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we ceased receiving any revenue from Genentech after the first quarter of 2016.
Biogen
We entered into a patent license agreement, effective April 24, 1998, under which we granted to Elan Corporation, plc (“Elan”) a license under our Queen et al. patents to make, use and sell antibodies that bind to the cellular adhesion molecule α4 in patients with multiple sclerosis. Under the agreement, we are entitled to receive a flat royalty rate in the low, single digits based on Elan’s net sales of the Tysabri product. This license agreement entitles us to royalties following the expiration of our patents with respect to sales of licensed product manufactured prior to patent expiry in jurisdictions providing patent protection. In April 2013, Biogen, Inc. (“Biogen”) completed its purchase of Elan’s interest in Tysabri, and in connection with such purchase all obligations under our patent license agreement with Elan were assumed by Biogen.
Major Customers

Our revenues consist almost entirely of royalties and the changes in fair value of our royalty right assets. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, Genentech accounted for 43%, 70%, and 71% of our revenues, respectively, and Biogen accounted for 24%, 9% and 10% of our revenues, respectively. Although the last of our Queen et al. patents expired in December 2014, the royalty payments extended beyond the patent expiration based on the terms of our licenses and our legal settlements. In the second quarter of 2016, our revenues materially decreased after we stopped receiving payments from certain Queen et al. patent licenses and legal settlements, which accounted for 68%, 82% and 83% of our 2016, 2015 and 2014 revenues.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, we started to generate revenue from product sales to three major wholesalers in the United States. As of December 31, 2016, these three wholesalers accounted for 1.6%, 1.9% and 1.6%, respectively, of our total net sales in fiscal year 2016.

Competition
The two products of Noden are direct renin inhibitors approved for the treatment of hypertension. They compete against a number of classes of treatments including changes in diet, thiazide diuretics, ACEs, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, cardioselective beta blockers, alpha blockers, direct vasodilators and centrally acting agents. With the exception of diet, there are numerous drugs within each of the classes enumerated above, most of which have generic versions that are less expensive than Tekturna and Tekturna HCT. Physicians may also treat hypertension patients by combining one or more of the enumerated classes of treatments. Diet, thiazide diuretics, ACEs, ARBs and calcium channel blockers are most commonly used as first line treatments for hypertension and dominate the market, in part, because of the availability of low cost generics in each category. Renin inhibitors, such as Tekturna and Tekturna HCT which are the only approved direct renin inhibitors, and beta blockers are used thereafter followed by direct vasodilators, central acting agents and alpha blockers. Tekturna and Tekturna HCT are generally perceived as alternatives for patients who do not respond to, or are intolerant of, the first line therapies. In the United States, there are approximately six thiazide diuretics, eleven ACEs, eight ARBs and thirty-five calcium channel blockers, in each case, a number of which have one or more generic versions. There are approximately ten cardioselective beta blockers in the United States, a number of which have one or more generic versions.
Governmental Regulation
The research and development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. We and our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties, depending on specific activities performed, are subject to these regulations. In the United States, pharmaceuticals are subject to regulation by both federal and various state authorities, including the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products and there are often comparable regulations that apply at the state level. There are similar regulations in other countries as well. For both currently marketed and products in development, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in delays, the suspension of regulatory approvals, as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect
on us or our licensees, borrowers or royalty-agreement counterparties. For a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Manufacturing
We currently contract with one third-party for manufacturing our Noden Products, this arrangement is covered by a foreign long-term supply agreement. To date, our third-party manufacturer has met our manufacturing requirements. Although to date we have not experienced interruptions in supplies, we cannot assure that we will continue to receive uninterrupted or adequate supplies of such products. We expect that the third-party manufacturer is capable of providing sufficient quantities of our Noden Products to meet anticipated demands. Our foreign long-term supply agreement is subject to, among other risks, FDA approval, governmental clearances, export duties, political instability, and restrictions on the transfers of funds.
Any inability to obtain our Noden Products on a timely basis, or any significant price increases not passed on to customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Distribution
We entered into an arrangement with a third party logistic provider (“3PL”) who has commenced distribution of our Noden Products within the United States on our behalf. Our Noden Products are sold directly to wholesalers from 3PL-owned distribution centers.
The pharmaceutical industry’s largest wholesale distributors, Amerisource Bergen, McKesson and Cardinal Health, accounted for 1.6%, 1.9% and 1.6%, respectively, of our total net sales in fiscal year 2016.
Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we had eleven full-time employees managing our intellectual property, our asset acquisitions, operations and other corporate activities as well as providing for certain essential reporting and management functions of a public company. In addition, we have eight full-time employees at our Noden subsidiaries who manage Noden’s business and operations. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
