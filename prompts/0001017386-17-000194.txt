ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
 

We are engaged in the distribution of proprietary, licensed and third party food and beverages throughout the United States. HISP has already begun to distribute fruit juices, nectars, snacks, energy drinks and milk based products throughout the United States and we expect to begin to distribute teas, carbonated drinks, dry goods, preserves, frozen foods and bakery products in the near future. Most of the brands we distribute are distributed under a proprietary basis (through distribution agreements and/or exclusive licensing arrangements). Our Gran Nevada™ brands emulates the flavors, tastes, and traditions which have been known for generations among the Hispanic and other ethnic groups and are now becoming part of the American mainstream diet.
 
Our objective is to grow as rapidly as possible (both organically and via strategic alliances and acquisitions) using the public capital markets for access to capital. The companies and assets sought by us will be those that already have market penetration in the following segments: (1) Food Distribution and Manufacturing; (2) Beverage Brands and (3) Distribution Food Service.
 
Our management team has over 30 years of combined experience in the Hispanic food and beverage industry. In July 2016, we acquired the company’s first Direct Store Delivery (“DSD”) in an all cash purchase. HISP has new key personnel with previous managerial experience to begin the implementation of increasing our sales to potentially organically and via acquisitions.


Corporate Structure
 
Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc. was incorporated on April 15, 2013.
 
In October 2013, we signed a distribution agreement with Gran Nevada Beverage, Inc. (“Gran Nevada”), an entity related through common management. The agreement provides us with the right to sell and distribute Gran Nevada's beverages in the United States with purchase prices at the then applicable wholesale prices charged to Gran Nevada's distributors. The agreement is for an initial term of five years with automatic renewals of successive five year terms unless terminated.  We initiated sales and distribution operations in March 2014.
 
In July, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Energy Sources Distributors, Inc. (“ESD”) from its three founding shareholders. ESD provides wholesale distribution of specialty beverage products from its headquarters in Gilroy, California. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $450,000 in cash. We retained one of the selling founders as General Manager for a term of twelve (12) months pursuant to an employment agreement to manage operations at the ESD facility in Gilroy, California. ESD is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

Effective July 5, 2016, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “Credit Facility”) with TCA Global Credit Master Fund L.P. (“TCA”) for a total amount of $7.5 million. However, as of the execution date of the Credit Facility, only $1.6 million was allocated by TCA to the Company for working capital financing and for any other purpose permitted under the terms of the Credit Facility. Energy Source Distributors, Inc. (“ESD”) is Corporate Guarantor to the Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company paid advisory fees to TCA in the amount of $350,000, through the issuance of 374,332 shares of common stock. On July 5, 2016, the Company borrowed $650,000 from the Credit Facility and used the proceeds to acquire ESD for $450,000; payoff a note payable in the amount of $32,534; $74,466 was used to pay vendors for inventory purchases and $93,000 was paid to TCA for closing fees. The credit facility had a maturity date of January 5, 2017 which was extended for an additional six months. The credit facility requires fees and interest only payments at 12% during the first two months. Principal payments begin in the third month. At the maturity date all unpaid principal and interest is due. During the current quarter the Company issued an additional 157,480 shares of common stock to satisfy a default notice in the amount of $200,000.


On September 9, 2016, the Company announced that it has entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Plantain Republic, S.A. the maker of the TropicMax brand of plantain chips. The Distribution Agreement gives Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc. the exclusive territories of Northern California.
 
Sales
 
The Company currently markets and sells mainstream beverage and food products through its ESD subsidiary, and packaged Hispanic and ethnic beverage and food products. Brands sought by HISP are primarily engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling unique, premium, nonalcoholic beverages as well as all natural food products that are targeted towards Hispanic and ethnic-neutral consumers.
Production and Distribution
 
The Company buys prepackaged goods for distribution through various channels. The Company distributes third party brands as well as a proprietary brand named GRAN NEVADA under an exclusive distribution agreement covering the United States. As of August 2017, Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc. (HISP) distributes over 20 brands, mainly through its Energy Source Distribution (ESD) subsidiary, as well as sold the GRAN NEVADA beverages to other wholesalers that are primarily ethnic food distributors and mostly located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. HISP sells to several distributors and regularly seeks to broaden its distribution channels from its current network of a dozen to over 100 by the end of 2017. The Company has engaged third party sales and marketing brokers in many areas of the country. The Company also intends to sell directly to retailers, including large chain stores. Hispanica and its subsidiaries sell to about 2,000 retailers.
Competition
 
As a distributor of Hispanic and ethnic packaged food products, we expect to have a portfolio of products that will not only include beverages. Our main competitors include Goya Foods, Marquez Brothers International, Diaz Foods, La Fe Foods International, Grace Foods, as well as other regional Ethnic Food Distributors. We will focus on selecting brands of all natural packaged foods. Although some competitors are selling and distributing similar products, they use different packaging options and in particular market foods that have high contents of artificial flavors, colors, and sweeteners as well high sodium contents. Additionally, our competitors import the majority of their distributed products, which are made with lower quality and price point raw materials. We will focus on distributing all natural products as well as obtaining exclusive rights to brands that can be manufactured closer to its U.S. market base.  We are committed to building long-term relationships with our consumers by offering superior, high quality products at the most competitive prices.

The packaged beverage market is highly competitive. Competitors in our market compete for brand recognition, ingredient sourcing, qualified personnel, distribution and product shelf space.  As a developing company, a majority of our competitors are more established and better capitalized.  The packaged beverage market is generally dominated by the largest beverage providers. Many of our competitors enjoy significant brand recognition and consumer confidence and are able to readily secure shelf space and media attention for their products. Many of our competitors also have existing relationships with the same distribution channels and retailers through which we sell our products. We intend to compete in the market by offering consumers affordable products that taste better and possess a longer shelf life than most products in the market.
 
Government Regulation
 
Packaged beverage and juice products are governed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As such, it is necessary for the Company to ensure its products distributed establish, maintain and make available for inspection, records and labels with nutrition information that meet legal food labeling requirements. The Company’s products are manufactured by contracted production facilities that are subject to many regulations, including Food Facility Registration, recordkeeping, Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements, reporting, preventive controls and inspections.
 
The Company has not incurred research and development expenses for new product development.
 
Employees
 
The Company currently has 11 full-time employees. Certain positions are being filled with paid independent contractors or insider owners who do not receive cash compensation but may receive stock compensation. The Company mitigates the need for a production staff by purchasing finished inventory. The Company has contracted with food brokers to represent Gran Nevada to retail stores nationally. In certain regions of the United States, we utilize the services of direct sales and distribution companies, which sell our products through their distribution channels. This can mitigate the need for a large sales and merchandising force. The Company also outsources its logistics to third-parties, which can reduce the need for employees in these roles.
Going Concern Qualification
 
Several conditions and events cast substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred net losses of $2,980,030 and $400,207 for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, has limited revenues and requires additional financing in order to finance its business activities on an ongoing basis. The Company’s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors including, but not limited to, continued progress in finding business opportunities. At May 31, 2017, we had cash on hand of $217,598 and an accumulated deficit of $3,794,579. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
 
Intellectual Property Protection
 
The Company is in the process of securing a registered trademark for its name and logo. HISP does not have its trademark registered for Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc. As of the date of this annual report, we do not have any trademarks or copyrights for our intellectual property.
Emerging Growth Company
 
The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Stamps Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements of Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

The Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
 
We will remain an “emerging growth company: until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which our revenues exceed $1 billion, (2) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion non-convertible debt in a three year period, (3) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (4) when the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.
 
To the extent that we continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirements to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years.
