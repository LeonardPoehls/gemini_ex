Our Company
Live Mediterranean. Live Zoes!
Zoës Kitchen (the "Company", "Zoës", "we" or "us") is a fast growing, fast-casual restaurant concept serving a distinct menu of fresh, wholesome, Mediterranean-inspired dishes delivered with Southern hospitality. Founded in 1995 in Birmingham, Alabama, Zoës Kitchen is a natural extension of Zoë Cassimus' lifetime passion for cooking Mediterranean meals for family and friends. Since opening our first restaurant, we have never wavered from our commitment to make our food fresh daily and to serve our customers in a warm and welcoming environment.
We believe our brand delivers on our customers' desire for freshly-prepared food and convenient, high-quality experiences. We have grown from 21 restaurants across seven states, including five franchised locations, as of December 29, 2008 to 204 restaurants across 20 states, including three franchised locations, as of December 26, 2016, representing a compound annual growth rate of 32.9%. Our Company-owned restaurants have generated 28 consecutive fiscal quarters of positive comparable restaurant sales growth, due primarily to increases in customer traffic, which we believe demonstrates our growing brand equity. We have grown our Company-owned restaurant average unit volumes ("AUVs") from approximately $1.1 million in 2009 to approximately $1.5 million in 2016, representing an increase of 35.9% over that time period. Our growth in comparable restaurant sales since 2009 has allowed us to invest significant amounts of capital to drive growth through the opening of new restaurants and the hiring of personnel required to support our growth plans.

Our Concept
Delivering Goodness, through our food and our people, in the communities we serve.
The word "zoë," which means "life" in Greek, is a key component of the Zoës Kitchen culture. Our mission is to "deliver goodness from the inside out" by: (i) offering a differentiated menu of simple, tasty and fresh Mediterranean cuisine; (ii) extending genuine Southern hospitality with personality, including food delivered to your table; (iii) providing an inviting, casual-chic environment in our restaurants; and (iv) delivering an outstanding catering experience for business and social events. Our menu offers meals made from scratch using produce, proteins and other ingredients that are predominantly preservative- and additive-free, including our appetizers, soups, salads, and kabobs. We promote our brand as an extension of our guests' own kitchens. We offer meals inspired by family recipes that remind our guests of food they would prepare at home, while allowing them to spend extra time with family and friends and fueling a more balanced and active lifestyle. Our food, including both hot and cold items, is well suited for catering to a variety of business and social occasions. We believe our catering offering is a significant competitive differentiator that generates consumer trial of our menu and provides additional opportunities for existing customers to enjoy our food off-premises.

Our Strengths
Live Mediterranean. Simple. Tasty. Fresh!  We believe the following strengths serve as the foundation for our continued growth.
Our Food-Simple. Tasty. Fresh!    We believe the Zoës Kitchen experience is driven by providing simple, tasty and fresh Mediterranean food at a compelling value to our customers. We aim to provide food that makes our customers feel good about themselves and their decision to choose Zoës Kitchen.

• | Simple. Our food is simply prepared and made to order in our scratch kitchens. Our cooking philosophy is rooted in rich traditions that celebrate food, rather than in fads or trends. We serve food using high-quality, wholesome ingredients and time honored preparations inspired by Mediterranean culinary traditions. 


• | Tasty. True to our heritage, the flavors in our menu are born in the Mediterranean and raised in the South. Inspired by family recipes and Zoës simple, fresh-from-the-garden sensibility, our menu features Mediterranean cuisine complemented with a few Southern staples. 


• | Fresh. We seek to provide customers with flavorful menu offerings that align with our customers' lifestyles. Fresh ingredients are delivered to our kitchens, where our Zoës team members wash, cut and prepare food in our kitchens daily. We cater to a variety of dietary needs by offering vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free and our calorie conscious Simply 500™ menu selections. 

Differentiated Fast-Casual Lifestyle Brand with a Desirable and Loyal Customer Base.    We believe the Zoës Kitchen brand reflects our customers' desire for convenient, unique and high-quality experiences and their commitment to family, friends and enjoying every moment. We believe we are an aspirational brand with broad appeal that our customers embrace as a reflection of their desired self-image - active, vibrant, sophisticated, genuine, caring and passionate, which results in customer advocacy and repeat visits. 
We provide a welcoming environment, attracting customers from a variety of demographic groups. Our combination of menu offerings, ambiance and location is designed to appeal to educated and health-conscious women, who along with their families, represent a substantial majority of our customer visits. We believe this demographic represents a highly-desirable customer base with strong influence on a family's mealtime decision-making and are strong brand advocates.
Delivering a Contemporary Mediterranean Experience with Southern Hospitality.    We strive to provide an inviting and enjoyable customer experience through the atmosphere of our restaurants and the friendliness of our team members. Our restaurants, highlighted by our distinct Zoës Kitchen stripes drawn from the color palette of many seaside Mediterranean neighborhoods, are designed to be warm, welcoming and full of energy. Our patios, a core feature of our restaurants, are an authentic part of both our Southern and Mediterranean heritage and we believe they provide a relaxing and welcoming dining environment.
True to our Southern heritage, we aim to deliver hospitality and attentive service whether our customers choose to dine-in, take-out or host a catered event. Our team members are the heart and soul of what we call "Southern hospitality with personality" - making sure our customers feel as welcome as they are well fed. We believe the atmosphere of our restaurants and the dedication of our team members encourages repeat visits, inspires advocacy and drives increased sales.
Diverse Revenue Mix Provides Multiple Levers for Growth.    We believe our differentiated menu of both hot and cold food enables our customers to utilize our restaurant for multiple occasions throughout the day. We had a balanced day-part mix of approximately 60% lunch and 40% dinner (excluding catering), and our catering business represented approximately 16% of revenue, for 2016. We believe we effectively serve both small and large groups in our restaurants, as well as outside of our restaurants with our catering and home meal replacement alternatives, such as our Zoës Fresh Take™ grab-and-go coolers and our Mediterranean Family Meals options.
Attractive Unit Economic Model with Proven Portability.  Our restaurant model is designed to generate strong cash flow, attractive restaurant-level financial results and attractive returns on invested capital. Our new restaurant investment model targets AUVs of $1.3 million and cash-on-cash returns in excess of 30% by the end of the third full year of operation. On average, new restaurants opened since the beginning of 2009 have exceeded these AUVs and cash-on-cash return targets within the third year of operations. 
We believe our strong performance and unit economics across a variety of geographic areas are validation of our concept's portability. For 2016, our top 20 performing restaurants were spread across seven different states.

Experienced Management Team.   Our strategic vision and results-driven culture are directed by our senior management team under the leadership of Kevin Miles, who guided the growth of our Company from 22 to 204 restaurants as of December 26, 2016. Mr. Miles is a fast-casual industry veteran with over 20 years of relevant experience including leadership roles at La Madeleine French Bakery and Café, Baja Fresh Mexican Grill and Pollo Campero. He directs a team of highly experienced and progressive leaders who are focused on executing our business plan and implementing our growth strategy.
Our Growth Strategies
Bringing Mediterranean Mainstream.    We plan to execute the following strategies to continue to enhance our brand awareness and grow our revenue and achieve profitability.
Grow Our Restaurant Base.     We believe we are in the early stages of our growth story and estimate a long-term total restaurant potential in the United States in excess of 1,600 locations. We utilize a sophisticated site selection process using proprietary methods to identify target markets and expansion opportunities within those markets. Based on this analysis, we believe there is substantial development opportunity in both new and existing markets. 
Increase Comparable Restaurant Sales.    We have consistently demonstrated strong comparable restaurant sales growth, and we intend to focus on generating future comparable restaurant sales growth with an emphasis on the following goals:

• | Heighten brand awareness to drive new customer traffic. We intend to generate new traffic growth at our restaurants through the application of targeted advertising messages, local restaurant-level marketing and the word-of-mouth of our existing customers. Our highly-targeted marketing strategy seeks to generate brand loyalty and promote advocacy by appealing to customers' emotional needs and desired self-image. 


• | Increase existing customer frequency. We expect to increase customer frequency by consistently providing fresh Mediterranean cuisine at a compelling value. We explore new menu additions by drawing upon the rich heritage and flavors of 21 Mediterranean countries to enhance our offerings. We will continue to explore ways to increase the number of occasions (lunch, dinner and catering), increase the flexibility of dining options (dine-in, to-go/take home, delivery, call-in and online) and capitalize on the increasing demand for convenient and healthy high-quality home meal replacement alternatives. 


• | Grow our catering business. Our management team has developed innovative solutions, loyalty programs and a dedicated team of sales professionals to enhance our catering offering. We believe our strong catering offering is a significant competitive differentiator and generates consumer trial of our brand as well as provides our existing customers additional ways to enjoy our food off-premises. 

Improve Margins and Leverage Infrastructure.   We have invested in our business, and we believe our corporate infrastructure can support a restaurant base greater than our existing footprint. As we continue to grow, we expect to drive greater efficiencies in our supply chain and leverage our technology and existing support infrastructure. Additionally, we believe we will be able to optimize labor costs at existing restaurants as our restaurant base matures and AUVs increase, and leverage corporate costs over time to enhance margins as general and administrative expenses grow at a slower rate than our restaurant base and revenues.
Site Development and Expansion
Site Selection Process. We consider site selection and real estate development to be critical to our long-term success and devote significant resources to create predictable and successful new restaurant results. We have developed a targeted site evaluation and acquisition process incorporating management's experience as well as comprehensive data collection, analysis and interpretation. Our in-house real estate management team has over 50 years of combined experience with top restaurant brands.
When making site selection decisions, we use sophisticated analytical tools designed to uncover key demographic and psychographic characteristics in addition to site specific characteristics, such as visibility, access, signage and traffic patterns, which we believe drive successful restaurant placement. We consider factors including daytime population characteristics and residential density, which impact our catering and dine-in businesses. On the ground research is also an important part of the site evaluation process. This includes evaluation of customer traffic patterns, future development in the market, retail synergy and the competitive restaurant landscape.
Our sophisticated, predictive site selection strategy and flexible new restaurant model have resulted in growth in markets of varying sizes as we have expanded our restaurant base. We are able to utilize in-line, end-cap and free-standing restaurant formats to penetrate markets with a combination of suburban and urban restaurant locations.
Our real estate process is governed by our internal Development Committee, which is composed of senior management and led by our Chief Development Officer. Our Development Committee meets periodically to review new site opportunities and to approve new locations. Once a location has been approved by our Development Committee, we begin a design process to align the characteristics and feel of the location to the trade area.

Expansion Strategy. While we continue to be positioned for additional restaurant growth in existing markets, expansion into new territories will be vital to executing our growth strategy. We employ a hub and spoke method to expansion whereby certain markets are denoted as hubs based on total market potential and geographic spacing. Surrounding spoke markets are subsequently developed as hub markets are penetrated and have reached sufficient brand awareness.
Expansion into new markets is triggered through the ongoing evaluation of existing market penetration with a goal of maintaining a deep pipeline of top-tier development opportunities. Our approach to identifying new markets for development is robust and systematic, providing an objective review of each market under consideration. 
Restaurant Design. Restaurant design is handled by our in-house construction team interfacing with outsourced contractor relationships. Our restaurant size averages approximately 2,750 square feet. The dining area of a typical restaurant can seat approximately 80 guests, with patios that seat approximately 30 guests. 
Construction. Each new restaurant typically requires an initial cash build-out cost of approximately $750,000, net of tenant allowances, but this figure could be significantly higher or lower depending on the market, materials used, restaurant size and condition of the premises upon landlord delivery. We generally construct restaurants in third-party leased retail shopping centers and in free-standing buildings on leased properties. For additional information regarding our leases, see "Item 2 - Properties."
Restaurant Management and Operations
We endeavor to run our company to create a superior customer experience by putting people first.
Talent Acquisition and Training.    Our ability to grow our restaurant base depends on hiring and investing in the growth of great talent. Acquiring and training our team members effectively is a significant focus for our company. We aim to hire people with a high desire to serve and please, that embrace the Zoës culture and are a reflection of our customers: active, passionate and full of life. 
We embrace technology and use it extensively to communicate with our employees. Our proprietary Lifeworks platform is designed to engage employees and create real connections, allowing both hourly and salaried employees to learn, connect and collaborate. Our entire training process is now paperless, with online videos replacing traditional operating manuals. Lifeworks also includes a learning methodology that embraces community generated content, allowing employees to make a tangible impact on the business, which we believe ultimately empowers them to deliver a superior customer experience.
Restaurant Management and Employees.    Each restaurant typically is staffed with a restaurant manager, an assistant manager and 20 to 30 team members. We cross-train our employees in an effort to create a depth of competency in our critical restaurant functions. Consistent with our emphasis on customer interaction, we encourage our restaurant managers and team members to welcome and engage with customers throughout the day. To lead our restaurant management teams, we have Regional Operators (each of whom is responsible for between five and ten restaurants), Regional Directors (each of whom is responsible for between four and six Regional Operators), as well as Regional Vice Presidents (each of whom is responsible for two Regional Directors and between four and five Regional Operators). 
We employ an extensive screening process for our managers, including both behavioral and working interviews. Once hired, these team members participate in a six week in-restaurant management training program, and all of our incumbent managers have completed this process. Each quarter, we have approximately 30 new manager-in-training candidates at one of our 12 training restaurants, which are located across various geographic regions. This pipeline of candidates is intended to assure us that future growth can be supported and that every new Zoës location is staffed with managers that are trained in both our brand and our standards.
Food Preparation and Quality.    We operate scratch kitchens, where food is prepared and cooked on site. We do not utilize pre-cooked proteins in our restaurants and do not use microwaves or fryers. We are committed to the hand-preparation of our food, including details like cutting fruit and vegetables in store and hand-crumbling feta cheese each morning because we believe that customers can taste the difference. 
Food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to help ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products. We have taken various steps to mitigate risks related to food quality and safety, including having our quality assurance team focus on this mitigation in coordination with our supply chain team. Our restaurants undergo third-party food safety reviews, internal safety audits and routine health inspections. We also consider the strength of a vendor's food safety program and quality assurance when selecting our distributors and suppliers.

Restaurant Marketing
Our marketing efforts seek to build brand awareness and increase sales through a variety of customer interactions and marketing initiatives. We focus our marketing strategy on highlighting our ability to provide customers with real food, which we believe directly impacts their psyches and delivers positive long-term emotional connections. We utilize community-based restaurant marketing, as well as digital, social and traditional media tools, to highlight our competitive strengths, including our varied and healthful menu offerings and the value we offer our customers.
Shared, Earned, Owned. Across our social channels, including Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram and Twitter, we reach many of our guests, which allows us to connect directly to them and to keep them informed about new menu offerings, promotions and events and build online relationships. In addition, our guests can opt into our e-mail marketing program or download our custom mobile LIFE app. Our mobile app includes customer engagement, customer satisfaction measurement and mobile ordering capabilities. Integrating these solutions has enabled us to reach a significant number of people in a timely and targeted fashion at a fraction of the cost of traditional media.
Local Restaurant Marketing. We empower our restaurant managers to selectively organize events to bring new customers into our restaurants. Additionally, we engage in a variety of promotional activities, such as contributing food, time and money to charitable, civic and cultural programs, for the purposes of giving back to the communities that we serve and increasing public awareness and appreciation of our restaurants and our employees. We refer to this internally as "Delivering Goodness." We use a wide range of local marketing initiatives to increase the frequency of and occasions for visits, and to encourage people to "Live Mediterranean." 
New Menu Introductions. We focus efforts on new menu offerings to broaden our appeal to customers and further substantiate our position as a leading brand in Mediterranean cuisine. We believe these additions deliver prompt consumer action, resulting in more immediate increases in customer traffic.
Internal Marketing. We believe our employees are one of our best marketing assets. We invest time, energy and resources towards education on our brand and developing long-term brand advocates from each employee. These employees help propagate the mission of "Delivering Goodness" and promote key points of differentiation.
Suppliers
Maintaining a high degree of quality in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire fresh ingredients and other necessary products that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. We carefully select suppliers based on quality and their understanding of our brand, and we seek to develop mutually beneficial long-term relationships with them. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward, fixed and formula pricing protocols. We have tried to increase, in some cases, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we monitor industry news, trade issues, weather, crises and other world events that may affect supply prices.
We contract with multiple suppliers including Sysco Corporation ("Sysco"), one of the largest distributors of food and related products to the U.S. food service industry. In 2016, our Sysco spend was approximately 90% of our cost of sales. Our remaining food supplies are distributed by other distributors under separate contracts. Our distributors deliver supplies to our restaurants approximately two to four times per week.
We negotiate pricing and volume terms directly with certain suppliers and distributors, including Sysco. Poultry represented approximately 14% of our total cost of sales for 2016. We are subject to weekly market fluctuations under our current pricing agreements with respect to poultry. Beef represented approximately 11% of our total costs of sales for 2016. Produce and paper products represented approximately 21% and 12%, respectively, of our total cost of sales for 2016. Feta cheese represented approximately 3% of our total cost of sales for 2016. Many of our pricing agreements reset annually. We have identified secondary suppliers for many of our significant products, and we believe we would be able to source our product requirements from multiple suppliers, if necessary
Competition
We compete in the restaurant industry, primarily in the fast-casual segment but also with restaurants in other segments. We face significant competition from a wide variety of restaurants, grocery stores and other outlets on a national, regional and local level. We believe that we compete primarily based on product quality, restaurant concept, ambiance, service, location, convenience, value perception and price. Our competition continues to intensify as competitors increase the breadth and depth of their product offerings and open new restaurants. Additionally, we compete with local and national fast-casual restaurant concepts, specialty restaurants and other retail concepts for prime restaurant locations.
8

Seasonality
Seasonal factors and the timing of holidays cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our sales per restaurant is typically lower in the first and fourth quarters due to reduced winter and holiday traffic and higher in the second and third quarters. Adverse weather conditions may also negatively impact customer traffic, resulting in lower revenues for the affected locations. For example, since we operate a substantial number of our restaurants in the Southern part of the United States, any adverse weather pattern across this region may adversely affect our guests’ visits in this region throughout the duration of such pattern. In addition, we have outdoor seating at all of our restaurants, and the effects of adverse weather may restrict the use of these areas, and negatively impact our revenues as well.
Intellectual Property and Trademarks
We own a number of trademarks and service marks registered or pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO"). We have registered the following marks with the PTO: Zoës Kitchen; Zoe's Kitchen; Simple. Tasty. Fresh!; Zoës Fresh Take; Eat Smart Eat Fresh; and Simply 500. We have also registered our trademarks and service marks in certain foreign countries as well. In addition, we have registered the Internet domain name www.zoeskitchen.com. The information on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of this report.
An important part of our intellectual property strategy is the monitoring and enforcement of our rights in markets in which our restaurants currently exist or markets which we intend to enter in the future. We also monitor trademark registers to oppose the applications to register confusingly similar trademarks or to limit the expansion of the scope of goods and services covered by existing similar trademarks. We enforce our rights through a number of methods, including the issuance of cease-and-desist letters or making infringement claims in federal court.
We believe that our trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property rights have significant value and are important to the marketing of our brand, and it is our policy to protect and defend vigorously our rights to such intellectual property. However, we cannot predict whether steps taken to protect such rights will be adequate. See "Item 1A - Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Industry-We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business."
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to extensive and varied federal, state and local government laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, regulations related to zoning, licensing, employment, food safety, nutritional content, information security, sanitation, fire prevention and other environmental matters. New laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with existing and new laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future and any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. In addition, we operate each of our restaurants in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable licensing requirements. However, an inability to obtain or retain health department or other licenses would adversely affect our operations. Although we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, any significant difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals, any such problem could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a particular restaurant or group of restaurants. For additional information regarding regulations that we face in our business, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations,” and “- Legislation and regulations requiring the display and provision of nutritional information for our menu offerings, and new information or attitudes regarding diet and health could result in changes in regulations and consumer consumption habits that could adversely affect our results of operations.” We are not aware of any federal, state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, that have materially affected, or are reasonably expected to materially affect, our results of operations, competitive position, or capital expenditures.”
Management Information Systems
All of our restaurants use computerized point-of-sale and back-office systems that we believe are scalable to support our future growth plans. These point-of-sale computers are designed specifically for the restaurant industry. The system provides a touch screen interface, a graphical order confirmation display and integrated, high-speed credit card and gift card processing. The point-of-sale system is used to collect daily transaction data, which generates information about daily sales, product mix and average check size. All products sold and prices at our restaurants are programmed into the system from our home office.
Our in-restaurant back office computer system is designed to assist in the management of our restaurants and provide labor and food cost management tools. These tools provide home office and restaurant operations management quick access to detailed business data and reduces restaurant managers' time spent on administrative needs. The system provides our restaurant managers 
9

the ability to submit orders electronically with our distribution network. The system also supplies sales, bank deposit and variance data to our accounting department on a daily basis. We use this data to generate daily sales information and weekly consolidated reports regarding sales and other key measures, as well as preliminary weekly detailed profit and loss statements for each location with final reports following the end of each period.
Employees
As of December 26, 2016, we had 4,643 employees, including 138 home office and regional personnel, 408 restaurant level managers and assistant managers and 4,097 hourly employees. None of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our current employee relations to be good.
Franchising
As of December 26, 2016, we had three franchised restaurants in one state. Our franchise arrangements grant third-parties a license to establish and operate a restaurant using our systems and our trademarks in a given area. The franchisee pays us for the ideas, strategy, marketing, operating system, training, purchasing power and brand recognition. Franchised restaurants must be operated in compliance with our methods, standards and specifications, regarding menu items, ingredients, materials, supplies, services, fixtures, furnishings, décor and signs.
