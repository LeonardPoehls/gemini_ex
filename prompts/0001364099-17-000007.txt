ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Our Company
Innophos is a leading international producer of specialty ingredient solutions that deliver versatile benefits for the food, health, nutrition and industrial markets. We leverage our expertise in the science and technology of blending and formulating phosphate, mineral, enzyme and botanical based ingredients to help our customers offer products that are tasty, healthy, nutritious and economical. Headquartered in Cranbury, New Jersey, Innophos has manufacturing operations across the United States, in Canada, Mexico and China.
 Innophos combines more than a century of experience in specialty phosphate manufacturing with a broad range of other specialty nutritional ingredients. Utilizing our capabilities in consumer insight, research and product development and application expertise, we partner with our customers to provide differentiated product offerings that respond to consumer preferences and megatrends. We utilize this collaborative approach in order to attempt to generate market share gains for our customers.
Many of Innophos’ products are application-specific compounds engineered to meet customer performance requirements and are often critical to the taste, texture, performance or nutritional content of foods, beverages, pharmaceuticals, oral care products and other applications. For example, Innophos products act as flavor enhancers in beverages, electrolytes in sports drinks, texture additives in cheeses, leavening agents in baked goods, pharmaceutical excipients and cleaning agents in toothpaste, and they also provide a wide range of nutritional fortification solutions for food, beverage and nutritional supplement manufacturers.
Over the past six years, Innophos has expanded its product offering to include botanical, enzyme and mineral based nutritional ingredients. Bioactive mineral ingredients are mineral based ingredients for food, beverage and dietary supplement end markets that are manufactured to be readily digestible. Innophos has always enjoyed a strong position in “macronutrients,” such as calcium, magnesium and potassium that are required in relatively large amounts for a balanced diet. More recently, Innophos has built a strong position in “micronutrients”, such as chromium, selenium, zinc and iron, small quantities of which are also essential to the human diet. As with the bioactive mineral ingredients, botanical and enzyme based specialty nutritional ingredients are important to Innophos' customers for their nutritional value, and mineral, botanical and specialty phosphate ingredients are often formulated together.
Innophos commenced operations as an independent company in August 2004 after purchasing its North American specialty phosphates business from affiliates of Rhodia, S.A., or Rhodia, which has been a part of Solvay S.A. since 2011. In November 2006, Innophos completed an initial public offering and listed its common stock for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “IPHS”.
Key Product Lines
We have four principal product lines: (i) Specialty Ingredients; (ii) Food and Technical Grade Purified Phosphoric Acid, or PPA; (iii) Technical Grade Sodium Tripolyphosphate, or STPP, & Detergent Grade PPA and (iv) Granular Triple Super Phosphate, or GTSP, & Other. The first three product lines comprise our two Specialty Phosphates reporting segments, US & Canada and Mexico, with GTSP & Other reported separately in a third reporting segment.
In 2016, we achieved sales of $725 million of which 93% can be attributed to our two Specialty Phosphates reporting segments, US & Canada and Mexico, and the remaining 7% to the GTSP & Other segment.
Specialty Ingredients
Specialty Ingredients are the most highly engineered products in our portfolio. Specialty ingredients consist of specialty phosphate salts, specialty phosphoric acids and a range of other mineral, enzyme and botanical based specialty ingredients. They have a wide range of applications such as flavor enhancers in beverages, electrolytes in sports drinks, texture modifiers in cheeses, leavening agents in baked goods, mineral and botanical sources for nutritional supplements, pharmaceutical excipients and abrasives in toothpaste. Specialty phosphoric acids are used in industrial applications such as asphalt modification and petrochemical catalysis.

Each salt or acid derivative typically has a number of different applications and end uses. For example, DCP can be used both as a leavening agent in bakery products and as an abrasive in oral care products. However, several food grade salts are unique to the end user in their particular finished product application. We often work directly with customers to tailor products to their required specifications.
The phosphates industry is highly competitive. Many of our products are viewed as basic ingredients that compete with virtually identical products and derivatives manufactured by other companies in the industry. The United States is a competitive market with several competitors importing products from overseas. Our major competitor in the downstream Specialty Ingredients market is Israel Chemicals Limited, or ICL, which is our principal competitor in the specialty phosphates industry. We also compete in the specialty phosphates industry with imports from Germany, Belgium, Israel, Russia, North Africa and China. Our nutritional ingredients business faces competition from a number of competitors as the industries in which we compete in connection with this business are less consolidated than the specialty phosphates industry.

Food and Technical Grade PPA
Food and Technical Grade PPA are high purity forms of PPA, distinct from the agricultural-grade merchant green phosphoric acid, or MGA, used in fertilizer production. PPA is used to manufacture specialty phosphate salts and acids and is also used directly in beverage applications as a flavor enhancer and in water treatment applications. We also sell technical grade PPA in the merchant market to third-party phosphate derivative producers.
Our major PPA competitor is Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc., or PCS, a global fertilizer company for which specialty phosphates represents only a small part of its business. We consume the majority of our PPA production in our downstream operations and sell the remainder on the North American merchant market and to other downstream phosphate derivative producers, where we compete with PCS. We also compete with imports from China, Belgium and Israel.
STPP & Detergent Grade PPA
STPP is a specialty phosphate derived from reacting PPA with a sodium alkali. STPP is a key ingredient in cleaning products, including industrial and institutional cleaners and automatic dishwashing detergents and consumer laundry detergents outside the United States. In addition to its use in cleaning products, STPP is also used in water treatment, clay processing, and copper ore processing. The end use market for STPP is largely derived from consumer product applications. Detergent Grade PPA is a lower grade form of PPA used primarily in the production of STPP.
Our major North American STPP competitor is Mexichem, S.A.B. de C.V., or Mexichem, in Mexico. Currently, Mexichem produces STPP at two manufacturing locations in Mexico. We also compete with imports from North Africa, Europe, Russia and China.
Over the past several decades, there have been efforts to reduce the use of STPP in consumer and institutional cleaners. In the 1980’s, STPP use in consumer laundry applications was discontinued in the United States and Canada. STPP use was essentially eliminated in consumer automatic dishwashing applications in the United States and Canada in 2010. The industrial and institutional cleaner market has also reformulated some of its products to reduce STPP content in an effort to market a reduced phosphate content product line.
GTSP & Other
GTSP is generated at our Coatzacoalcos facility in Mexico as a co-product of our purified wet acid manufacturing process described further below under “Our Industry”. GTSP is a fertilizer product used throughout Latin America for increasing crop yields in a wide range of agricultural sectors.
For financial information about our segments and geographic areas, please see Note 20 (Segment Reporting) of the Notes to Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Data” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Industry
Overview
The North American marketplaces for each of our product lines have experienced consolidation to two primary producers and several secondary suppliers, distributors and importers. We consider the two key producers in each product category to be: (i) Innophos and ICL in Specialty Ingredients; (ii) Innophos and PCS in Food and Technical Grade PPA; and (iii) Innophos and Mexichem in Technical Grade STPP. We are not a significant supplier to the GTSP fertilizer market.
The production of specialty phosphates begins with phosphate rock, which can be processed in two alternative ways to produce PPA: (i) the thermal acid method, in which elemental phosphorus is combusted in a furnace and subsequently hydrated to produce PPA; or (ii) the purified wet acid method, or PWA, in which mined phosphate rock is reacted with a strong acid (most often sulfuric acid) to produce MGA, which is then purified through solvent-based extraction into PPA. The conversion of MGA into PPA is a technically complex and a capital-intensive process.
The thermal acid method of production is based on the electrolytic production of elemental phosphorus and is therefore electricity intensive, while PPA made by the purified wet acid process requires the use of significant amounts of sulfuric acid. The relative overall costs of the two methods depend on the availability and cost of their component processes, which are electricity and metallurgical or petroleum coke for the former and sulfur for the latter. PPA is reacted with appropriate mineral salts or inorganic compounds to produce various specialty phosphate salts as required. We currently use PPA manufactured via the wet acid process for all of our Specialty Ingredients manufacturing needs. Other alternative methods of production, such as a kiln-based thermal method, are under research and development which, if implemented, could add to the future capital needs of phosphate producers and change the competitive landscape in the industry.
Page  6 of 84

 We also produce a wide range of botanical, enzyme and mineral based ingredients as part of our nutrition business through a variety of customized production processes resulting in an extensive suite of product formulations. The North American botanical, enzyme and mineral industries are less consolidated than the specialty phosphates industry with Albion Minerals, acquired by Balchem Corporation in 2016, and Jost Chemical Company considered the leading competitors in mineral chelates, and Naturex Inc. and BI Nutraceuticals Inc. considered the leading competitors in botanical ingredients, alongside a number of smaller producers in each of these markets.
Penetration of North American Market from Imports
Over the past several years, we estimate that imports, including domestically located production facilities owned by foreign based organizations, have accounted for approximately 19-22% of the North American specialty phosphate market. This market share has slightly increased over the last three years. In addition, in 2016, we experienced pricing pressure from manufacturing overcapacity outside of North America, which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future.
For a discussion of the risks associated with the competition that we face in our markets, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business Operations-Competition -The success of our business depends on our ability to successfully compete in extremely competitive markets.” appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Customers
We supply a broad range of customers in over 70 countries worldwide. No customer accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2016, 2015 or 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we generated net sales of $725.3 million, $789.1 million and $839.2 million, respectively.
Our customer base is principally composed of consumer goods manufacturers, distributors and specialty chemical manufacturers. Our customers manufacture products such as soft drinks, sports drinks and juices, various food products, toothpaste and other dental products, petroleum and petrochemical products, and various cleaners and detergents. Our customers include major consumer goods manufacturers with global market recognition in the food, beverage, pharmaceutical and cleaning product markets. We have maintained long-term relationships with the majority of our key customers, with the average customer relationship having lasted over 15 years, and some relationships spanning many decades. Our specialty ingredient products are often critical ingredients in the formulation of our customers’ product, and typically represent only a small percentage of their total product costs. As a result, we believe that the risks associated with our customers switching suppliers can in some instances outweigh the potential gains.
Raw Materials and Energy
We purchase a range of raw materials and energy sources on the open market, including phosphate rock, sulfur and sulfuric acid, MGA, PPA, natural gas and electricity. To help secure supply, we purchase several of our key raw materials under long-term contracts generally providing for fixed or minimum quantities of materials, or purchase of our full requirements, and predetermined pricing formulae based on various market indices and other factors. We do not engage in any significant futures or other derivative contracts to hedge against fluctuations of raw materials. We are not currently integrated vertically back to our sources of supply by ownership interests, joint ventures or affiliated companies, as a result of which raw materials acquisition at economical price levels is an important risk of our business. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Raw Materials Availability and Pricing - The success of our business depends on our ability to successfully source sufficient amounts of the raw materials used in our products at competitive prices, often from a limited number of suppliers, some of whom with we do not have a long-term contract in place.” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with our sourcing raw materials.
Phosphate Rock and MGA. MGA, which is purified to produce PPA, is the main raw material for the creation of our downstream salts and acids. We purchase MGA for processing at our Geismar, Louisiana facility through a long-term agreement for MGA with PCS. At our Coatzacoalcos facility in Mexico, we typically purchase phosphate rock in order to produce MGA internally; however, we can also process externally purchased MGA available from various suppliers globally. In addition to our primary sources, we have options for other spot suppliers and will continue to qualify and develop additional sources for potential future supply.
Sulfur and Sulfuric Acid. Sulfur is the key raw material used in the production of sulfuric acid, a key raw material used in the production of MGA by the wet method. We produce the vast majority of the sulfuric acid required to operate our Coatzacoalcos facility. The majority of the sulfuric acid required for the production of MGA by PCS supplied to our Geismar, Louisiana facility is supplied by Solvay. Our U.S. needs for sulfuric acid and our Mexican needs for sulfur are handled through contracts with Solvay and Pemex-Gas y Petroquimica Basica, respectively.
Page  7 of 84

Purified Phosphoric Acid. The key raw material input for all of our downstream specialty phosphate salt and specialty phosphoric acid operations is PPA. In addition to purifying MGA to produce PPA internally, we also purchase certain quantities of our PPA supply from third parties to optimize our consumption and net sales, including from PCS with whom we have a supply contract for PPA (distinct from the supply contract for MGA) which will expire in July 2018. In 2016, Innophos produced approximately three quarters and purchased approximately one quarter of its total PPA supply.
Natural Gas and Electricity. Natural gas and electricity are used to operate our facilities and generate heat and steam for the various manufacturing processes. We typically purchase natural gas and electricity on the North American open market at so-called “spot rates.” From time to time, we will enter into longer term natural gas and electricity supply contracts in an effort to eliminate some of the volatility in our energy costs. We did not enter into any economic hedges in the past three years.
Research and Development
Our product application and development activities are aimed at developing and enhancing products, processes, applications and technologies to strengthen our position in our markets and with our customers. We focus on:

• | developing new or improved application-specific specialty phosphate and other mineral, enzyme and botanical based specialty ingredients based on our existing product line and identified or anticipated customer needs;


• | creating new products to be used in new applications or to serve new markets;


• | providing customers with premier technical services as they integrate our ingredients into their products and manufacturing processes;


• | ensuring that our products are manufactured in accordance with our stringent regulatory, health and safety policies and objectives and applicable law;


• | developing more efficient and lower cost manufacturing processes; and


• | expanding existing, and developing new, relationships with customers to meet their product application needs.

Our research expenditures were $3.7 million, $4.5 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Environmental and Regulatory Compliance
Certain of our operations involve manufacturing and marketing ingredients for use in food, nutritional supplement and pharmaceutical excipient products, and therefore must comply with U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, regulatory controls and similar regulatory controls of foreign jurisdictions where we operate, as well as good manufacturing practices and the quality requirements of our customers. The regulation of, and legal requirements for, the manufacture and sale of our products is a changing environment, and those changes may require increased operating costs to develop and implement additional product safety measures. Although there is some harmonization among the regulatory requirements of various jurisdictions, each country’s specific regulatory requirements apply to products imported and sold in that country. Regulatory systems throughout the world vary in complexity and transparency, as well as the time required to navigate such system in order to enter the subject market. Our growth that involves expansion of existing products into new markets or new products into current or new markets is affected by our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and achieve and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, public perception in the United States, Europe and other markets of phosphate products in relation to their safety and other market and legal trends related to “natural”, “organic“ and “clean labeling” in foods also may affect our sales and operations.
In addition, our operations that involve the use, handling, processing, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials are subject to extensive and frequently changing environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration, or FRA, as well as regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our operations in Canada, Mexico and China. Our operations also expose us to the risk of claims for environmental remediation and restoration or for exposure to hazardous materials. Our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal or modification. Violations of health and safety and environmental laws, regulations, or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on operating activities, substantial fines, penalties, damages, the rescission of an operating permit, third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, or other costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Due to changes in health and safety and environmental laws and regulations, the time frames when those laws and regulations might be applied, and developments in environmental control technology, we cannot predict with certainty the amount of capital expenditures to be incurred for environmental purposes.
Some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users of facilities, and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. Many of our sites have an extended history of industrial use. Soil and groundwater contamination have been detected at some of our sites, and additional contamination might occur or be discovered at these sites or other sites in the future (including sites to 
Page  8 of 84

which we may have sent hazardous waste). We continue to investigate, monitor or cleanup contamination at most of these sites. The potential liability for all these sites will depend on several factors, including the extent of contamination, the method of remediation, future developments and increasingly stringent regulation, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies, the liability of third parties, potential natural resource damage and insurance coverage. Liabilities for environmental matters are recorded in the accounting period in which our responsibility is established and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Due to the uncertainties associated with environmental investigations, cleanups and other obligations, as well as the ongoing nature of the investigations, cleanups and other obligations at our sites, we are unable to predict precisely the nature, cost and timing of our future remedial obligations with respect to our sites and, as a result, our actual environmental costs and liabilities could significantly exceed our accruals.
Further information, including the current status of significant environmental matters and the financial impact incurred for the remediation of such environmental matters, is included in Note 16 (Commitments and Contingencies) of the Notes to Financial Statements in "Part II, Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks - We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and government policies, including with respect to product quality and labeling and the environment, which may change in significant ways.” appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect certain key intellectual aspects of our business. In addition, our pool of proprietary information, consisting of manufacturing know-how, trade secrets and unregistered copyrights relating to the design and operation of our facilities and systems, is considered particularly important and valuable. Accordingly, we seek to protect proprietary information through all legal means practicable. However, monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and the steps we have taken may not prevent all unauthorized use by others.
Insurance
In the normal course of business, we are subject to numerous operating risks, including risks associated with environmental contamination, health and safety while manufacturing, developing and supplying products and potential damage to a customer.
We currently have in force insurance policies covering property, general liability, excess liability, workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, product liability, product recall, fiduciary and other coverages. We seek to maintain coverages consistent with market practices and required by those customers with whom we do business. Where appropriate for the protection of our property and interests, we also require others with whom we do business to provide certain coverages for our benefit. We believe that we are appropriately insured for the insurable risks associated with our business.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,319 employees at our facilities worldwide, of whom 758 were unionized hourly wage employees. We currently employ both union and non-union employees at most of our facilities. We believe we have a good working relationship with our employees, which has resulted in high productivity and low turnover in key production positions. We have experienced no work stoppages or strikes at any of our unionized facilities since acquiring them in 2004. We are a party to a collective bargaining agreement with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, Local No. 7-765 through January 16, 2020 at the Chicago Heights facility; International Union of Operating Engineers, Local No. 369 through April 21, 2019 at the Nashville facility; the Health Care, Professional, Technical, Office, Warehouse and Mail Order Employees Union, affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 743 through June 17, 2017 at the Chicago (Waterway) facility; the United Steelworkers, Local No. 6304 through April 30, 2017 at the Port Maitland, Ontario facility; and the Sindicato de Trabajadores de la Industria Química, Petroquímica, Carboquímica, Gases, Similares y Conexos de la República Mexicana, at the Mexico facilities. The agreement at the Coatzacoalcos, Mexico facility is for an indefinite period, but wages are reviewed every year and the rest of the agreement is subject to negotiation every two years (next scheduled for June 2018).
