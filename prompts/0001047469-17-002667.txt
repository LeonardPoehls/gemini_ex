     DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST 
  General 
         The TEL Offshore Trust, which we refer to herein as the "Trust," was created under the laws of the State of Texas in 1983 and maintains its offices at the office of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., whom we refer to as the "Corporate Trustee," 919 Congress Avenue, Suite 500, Austin, Texas 78701. The telephone number of the Corporate Trustee is 1 (512) 236-6599. Gary C. Evans, Thomas H. Owen, Jr. and Jeffrey S. Swanson currently serve as individual trustees of the Trust and are referred to herein as the "Individual Trustees." The Individual Trustees tendered their resignations on January 17, 2017 and such resignations will become effective on September 1, 2017, a date more than one hundred twenty days after the date upon which this Form 10-K is mailed to the Trust's Unit holders. The Individual Trustees and the Corporate Trustee may be referred to hereinafter collectively as the "Trustees." 
         The Corporate Trustee does not maintain a website for filings by the Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to herein as the "SEC." Electronic filings by the Trust with the SEC are available free of charge through the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. The Trust will also provide paper copies of its recent filing free upon request to the Corporate Trustee. 
   History of the Trust 
         Tenneco Offshore Company, Inc. ("Tenneco Offshore") created the Trust effective January 1, 1983, pursuant to a Plan of Dissolution ("Plan"), which was approved by Tenneco Offshore's stockholders on December 22, 1982. In accordance with the Plan, the assets of Tenneco Offshore were transferred to the Trust as of January 1, 1983, and units of beneficial interest in the Trust, which we refer to herein as "Units," were exchanged for shares of common stock of Tenneco Offshore on the basis of one Unit for each share of common stock held by stockholders of record on January 14, 1983. Additionally, the TEL Offshore Trust Partnership, which we refer to herein as the "Partnership," was formed, in which the Trust owned a 99.99% interest and Tenneco initially owned a .01% interest. The Partnership was formed solely for the purpose of owning the Royalty (as defined below), receiving the proceeds from the Royalty, paying the liabilities and expenses of the Partnership and disbursing remaining revenues to the Trust and the managing general partner, which we refer to herein as the "Managing General Partner," of the Partnership in accordance with their interests. The Plan was effected by transferring the Original Royalty (as defined below) to the Partnership, contributing the common stock of Tenneco Offshore II Company to the Trust, and issuing certificates evidencing Units in liquidation and cancellation of Tenneco Offshore's common stock. 
         The principal asset of the Trust consists of a 99.99% interest in the Partnership. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., or "Chevron," owns the remaining 0.01% interest in the Partnership and is the current Managing General Partner. Until October 27, 2011, the Partnership owned 100% of an overriding royalty interest equivalent to a 25% net profits interest (the "Original Royalty"), in certain oil and gas properties, which we refer to herein as the "Royalty Properties," located offshore Louisiana. The term "Original Royalty" shall refer to the initial 25% net profits interest in the Royalty Properties and the term "Royalty" shall refer to the applicable net profits interest held from time to time by the Partnership following the Royalty Sales (as defined below). 
         On October 27, 2011, the Trust issued a press release announcing that the Partnership had consummated the sale (the "2011 Royalty Sale") of 20% of the Original Royalty (or 5% of 8/8ths) to RNR Production, Land and Cattle Company, Inc. ("RNR Production"), though the assignment was effective as of August 1, 2011. 
 4

           On October 31, 2013, the Trust issued a press release announcing that the Partnership had consummated the sale (the "2013 Royalty Sale") of 25% of its remaining interest in the Original Royalty (or 5% of 8/8ths), to RNR Production, though the assignment was effective as of August 1, 2013. 
         On June 27, 2016, the Trust issued a press release announcing that the Partnership had, pursuant to the Probate Proceeding (as herein defined), consummated the sale of all of its remaining interest in the Original Royalty (60% or 15% of 8/8ths) (the "2016 Royalty Sale," and together with the 2011 Royalty Sale and the 2013 Royalty Sale, the "Royalty Sales"). The 2016 Royalty Sale was made to Arena Energy, LP and closed on June 24, 2016, but was effective as of February 1, 2016. The 2016 Royalty Sale generated $1,830,000 in gross proceeds and occurred as part of the previously announced formal auction process for the overriding royalty interest. The Trust received a distribution of approximately $1,756.624, representing 99.99% of the net proceeds from the Royalty Sale of $1,756,800. 
         As a result of the 2016 Royalty Sale, the Trust no longer owns any interest in the Royalty and therefore will not receive any further distributions of Net Proceeds (as herein defined) realized from any sale of oil, gas and associated hydrocarbons from the Royalty Properties. Because of the Remaining Matters (as defined in "Legal ProceedingsProbate Proceeding") in the Probate Proceeding (as defined in "Legal ProceedingsProbate Proceeding"), the Trust must hold the net proceeds from the 2016 Royalty Sale in a segregated account until the final resolution of the Remaining Matters. In addition, the Trust has set aside the distribution received from Cox Oil Offshore, L.L.C. ("Cox Oil") until the final resolution of the Remaining Matters. Distributions may be made from such segregated account for the payment of Trust expenses, which may include the payment of the Ad Litem's (as defined in "Legal ProceedingsProbate Proceeding") expenses, with the approval of the court. Any final disposition of the remaining net proceeds to Unit holders will be made in accordance with the final resolution of the Remaining Matters. For additional information about the Probate Proceeding, the Remaining Matters and the Ad Litem please see "Legal ProceedingsProbate Proceeding." 
         Unless the context in which such terms are used indicates otherwise, the terms "Working Interest Owner" and "Working Interest Owners" generally refer to the owner or owners of the Royalty Properties. For a list of Working Interest Owners see "Termination of the TrustDescription of Royalty Properties SoldProperties and Wells." 
   The Trust Agreement; the Partnership Agreement and the Conveyance 
         The terms of the TEL Offshore Trust Agreement, which we refer to herein as the "Trust Agreement," provide, among other things, that: (1) the Trust is a passive entity whose activities are generally limited to the receipt of revenues attributable to the Trust's interest in the Partnership and the distribution of such revenues, after payment of or provision for Trust expenses and liabilities, to the owners of the Units; (2) the Trustees may sell all or any part of the Trust's interest in the Partnership or cause the sale of all or any part of the Royalty by the Partnership with the approval of a majority of the Unit holders or if necessary to provide for the payment of liabilities of the Trust; (3) the Trustees can establish cash reserves and can borrow funds to pay liabilities of the Trust and can pledge the assets of the Trust to secure payment of such borrowings; (4) to the extent cash available for distribution exceeds liabilities or reserves therefore established by the Trust, the Trustees will cause the Trust to make quarterly cash distributions to the Unit holders in January, April, July and October of each year; and (5) the Trust will terminate upon the first to occur of the following events: (i) total future net revenues attributable to the Partnership's interest in the Royalty, as determined by independent petroleum engineers, as of the end of any year, are less than $2.0 million (without considering any sales of the Royalty) or (ii) a decision to terminate the Trust by the affirmative vote of Unit holders representing a majority of the Units; however, as a result of the Probate Proceeding and Remaining Matters, no termination of the Trust will occur until approved by the Court (as defined in "Legal ProceedingsProbate Proceeding"). 
 5

           The terms of the Agreement of General Partnership of the Partnership, which we refer to herein as the "Partnership Agreement," provide that the Partnership will dissolve upon the occurrence of any of the following: (1) December 31, 2030, (2) the election of the Trust to dissolve the Partnership, (3) the termination of the Trust, (4) the bankruptcy of the Managing General Partner of the Partnership, or (5) the dissolution of the Managing General Partner or its election to dissolve the Partnership; however, the Managing General Partner has agreed not to dissolve or to elect to dissolve the Partnership and will be liable for all damages and costs to the Trust if it breaches such agreement. 
         Prior to the 2016 Royalty Sale, the Conveyance and the Partnership Agreement entitled the Trust to its share (99.99%) of the Partnership's interest in 25% of the Net Proceeds (as defined herein) realized from the sale of the oil, gas and associated hydrocarbons produced from the Royalty Properties. Portions of the Partnership's interest in 25% of the Net Proceeds were sold in each of the Royalty Sales and as of February 1, 2016, the effective date of the 2016 Royalty Sale, the Partnership no longer held any interest in the Net Proceeds. See "Termination of the TrustDescription of Royalty Properties." The Conveyance provides that the Working Interest Owners will calculate, for each quarterly period commencing the first day of February, May, August and November, an amount equal to 25% of the Net Proceeds from their oil and gas properties for the period. "Net Proceeds" means for each quarterly period, the excess, if any, of the Gross Proceeds (as defined herein) for such period over Production Costs (as defined herein) for such period. "Gross Proceeds" means the amounts received by the Working Interest Owners from the sale of oil, gas and associated hydrocarbons produced from the properties burdened by the Royalty, subject to certain adjustments. Gross Proceeds do not include amounts received by the Working Interest Owners as advance gas payments, "take-or-pay" payments or similar payments unless and until such payments are extinguished or repaid through the future delivery of gas. "Production Costs" means, generally, costs incurred on an accrual basis by the Working Interest Owners in operating the Royalty Properties, including capital and non-capital costs. In general, Net Proceeds are computed on an aggregate basis and consist of the aggregate proceeds to the Working Interest Owners from the sale of oil and gas from the Royalty Properties less (1) all direct costs, charges and expenses incurred by the Working Interest Owners in exploration, production, development, drilling and other operations on the Royalty Properties (including secondary recovery operations); (2) all applicable taxes (including severance and ad valorem taxes) excluding income taxes; (3) all operating charges directly associated with the Royalty Properties; (4) an allowance for costs, computed on a current basis at a rate equal to the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank plus 0.5% on all amounts by which, and for only so long as, costs and expenses for the Royalty Properties incurred for any quarter have exceeded the proceeds of production from such Royalty Properties for such quarter; (5) applicable charges for certain overhead expenses as provided in the Conveyance; (6) the management fees and expense reimbursements owing the Working Interest Owners; and (7) a special cost reserve for the future costs to be incurred by the Working Interest Owners to plug and abandon wells and dismantle and remove platforms, pipelines and other production facilities from the Royalty Properties and for future drilling projects and other estimated future capital expenditures on the Royalty Properties. The Trustees were not obligated to return any Royalty income received during periods where Royalty income was being generated, however, future subsequent amounts otherwise payable were reduced by the amount of any prior overpayments of such Royalty income. Prior to the 2016 Royalty Sale, the Working Interest Owners were required to maintain books and records sufficient to determine amounts payable under the Original Royalty. The Working Interest Owners were also required to deliver to the Managing General Partner on behalf of the Partnership a statement of the computation of Net Proceeds no later than the tenth business day prior to the quarterly record date. 
         While the Trust had not received Net Proceeds from Chevron, as the operator of the Royalty Properties since December 2008, the Trust received payments in the aggregate amount of $1,316 from the operator of Eugene Island 342 during the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, on April 15, 2016, but effective as of August 1, 2015, Chevron conveyed certain oil and gas properties to Cox Oil, including Chevron's interest in Ship Shoal 182/183 that was subject to the Royalty (the "Cox Oil Sale"). 
 6

   All Net Proceeds from Cox Oil attributable to Ship Shoal 182/183 were not subject to offset by Chevron against the undistributed net loss carry forward attributable to the Royalty Properties held by Chevron. As a result of the August 1, 2015 effective time and the Ship Shoal 182/183 properties not being subject to the undistributed net loss carry forward, the Trust received a distribution from Cox Oil of $116,429 in May 2016. Despite the receipt of such funds, no distributions may be made by the Trust to the Unit holders until resolution of the Probate Proceeding. 
         Prior to the Royalty Sales, the Trust's primary source of liquidity and capital had been the Royalty income received from its share of the Net Proceeds from the Royalty Properties. As a result of the 2016 Royalty Sale, the Trust will not receive any further Net Proceeds from the Royalty Properties. 
         Because of the lack of Net Proceeds, the Trust has in the past not had sufficient cash flow to pay expenses on a current basis and has been required to borrow funds and to cause the Partnership to sell part of the Original Royalty in order to pay Trust expenses. As of December 31, 2016, the Trust had no unrestricted cash. The Trustees will endeavor to cause the Trust to pay the administrative costs of the Trust in accordance with the Trust Agreement. There are no assurances that the Trust will be able to continue to pay its administrative expenses. 
         Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trustees, on behalf of the Trust, are authorized to borrow funds, and pledge the assets of the Trust to secure payments of such borrowings, in the event that cash on hand is not sufficient to pay the liabilities of the Trust. In the event that the Trustees borrow additional funds to pay the liabilities of the Trust, no distributions will be made to the Unit holders until the indebtedness created by such borrowings, in addition to outstanding amounts from prior borrowings, have been paid in full. As discussed below, the Corporate Trustee has previously loaned funds to the Trust for the payment of the Trust's liabilities. 
         On October 1, 2014, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. made an advance to the Trust in the amount of $363,000, and the Corporate Trustee, on behalf of the Trust as the borrower, executed a Demand Promissory Note (the "2014 Note") relating to the unsecured $363,000 advance, which evidenced an extension of credit for borrowed money authorized under Section 6.08 of the Trust Agreement. The 2014 Note was mistakenly made payable to the Bank of New York Mellon ("BONYM"). In addition to the advances evidenced by the 2014 Note, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. made additional cash advances in the amount of $209,885 to the Trust for the payment of its liabilities and expenses, primarily in connection with the Probate Proceeding. On September 25, 2015, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. made an additional advance to the Trust in the amount of $484,000 and the Corporate Trustee, on behalf of the Trust as the borrower, executed a Renewal Demand Promissory Note (the "2015 Note") relating to (i) the unsecured $484,000 advance, (ii) the renewal and extension of the indebtedness originally evidenced by the 2014 Note in the original principal amount of $363,000, and (iii) previous advances in the amount of $209,885 made by The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. on behalf of the Trust. The 2015 Note provides for interest at the rate of one-half percent (0.5%) per annum. The 2015 Note became due and payable on December 31, 2016 and remains outstanding. The 2015 Note was also mistakenly made payable to BONYM. The 2015 Note has been assigned to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., the party that has made the advances to the Trust. In addition to the indebtedness owing under the 2015 Note, the Trust has received through December 31, 2016 advances from The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. in the amount of $68,224 and on March 31, 2017, the Trust received an additional unsecured advance of $184,751.55 from The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. During the year ended December 31, 2016, a portion of the proceeds from the 2015 Note were used to pay Trust expenses. In addition, the Corporate Trustee has used the additional advances received in 2016 for the payment of its liabilities and expenses, primarily in connection with the Probate Proceeding. Although The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. has no obligation to do so, it is anticipated that The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. will continue to advance funds to the Trust for the payment of such expenses.

           The discussions of terms of the Trust Agreement, Partnership Agreement and Conveyance contained herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Trust Agreement, Partnership Agreement and Conveyance themselves, which are incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and are available upon request from the Corporate Trustee. 
         The Trust has no employees. Administrative functions of the Trust are performed by the Corporate Trustee. 
      DESCRIPTION OF THE UNITS 
        Each Unit is evidenced by a transferable certificate issued by the Corporate Trustee. Each Unit ranks equally as to distributions, has one vote on any matter submitted to Unit holders and represents an undivided interest in the Trust, which in turn owns a 99.99% interest in the Partnership. 
         As of March 30, 2017, a total of 4,751,510 Units were issued and outstanding. The Units traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or "NASDAQ," from August 31, 2001 through January 2, 2011. On January 3, 2011, the Units were suspended from trading by the NASDAQ and the Trust filed a Form 25 with the SEC to announce the voluntary delisting of the Units. In an effort to reduce expenses, the Trustees determined that it was in the best interest of the Trust to voluntarily delist the Units and to cause the Units to no longer be traded on the NASDAQ. Since January 3, 2011, the Units have been quoted on the OTCQB Marketplace, which is an electronic quotation service operated by Pink OTC Markets Inc. for securities traded over-the-counter. 
   Distributions 
         The Trust has not received a distribution of Net Proceeds from Chevron, as the operator of the Royalty Properties, since December 2008 and has not made a distribution to Unit holders since January 9, 2009. As a result of the 2016 Royalty Sale, the Trust no longer owns any interest in the Royalty and therefore will not receive any further distributions of Net Proceeds for distributions to Unit holders. Because of the Remaining Matters in the Probate Proceeding, the Trust must hold the remaining proceeds from the 2016 Royalty Sale in a segregated account until the final resolution of the Remaining Matters at which time the Trust will distribute, in accordance with the final resolution of the Remaining Matters, any funds then held by the Trust. See "Description of the TrustHistory of the Trust" above and "Trustee's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationLiquidity and Capital Resources" in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 
         Within 90 days of the close of each year, the net federal taxable income of the Trust for each quarterly period ending in such year is reported by the Trustees for federal tax purposes to the Unit holder of record to whom the Quarterly Income Amount was distributed. 
   Possible Requirement That Units Be Divested 
         The Trust Agreement imposes no restrictions based on nationality or other status of the persons or other entities who are eligible to hold Units. However, the Trust Agreement provides that if at any time the Trust or any of the Trustees are named as a party in any judicial or administrative or other governmental proceeding that seeks the cancellation or forfeiture of any interest in any property located in the United States in which the Trust has an interest because of the nationality or any other status of any one or more owners of Units, or if at any time the Trustees in their reasonable discretion determine that such a proceeding is threatened or likely to be asserted and the Trust has received an 
 8

   opinion of counsel stating that the party asserting or likely to assert the claims has a reasonable probability of succeeding in such claim, the following procedures will be applicable: 
 
        (a)   The
Trustees, in their discretion, may seek from an investment banking firm to be selected by the Trustees an opinion as to whether it is in the Trust's best interest
for the Trustees to take the actions permitted by (b)(i) through (iii) below. 
        (b)   The
Trustees may take no action with respect to the potential cancellation or forfeiture or may seek to avoid such cancellation or forfeiture by the following procedure: 

          (i)  The
Trustees will promptly give written notice ("Notice") to each record owner of Units as to the existence of or probable assertion of such controversy. The Notice
will contain a reasonable summary of such controversy, will include materials which will permit an owner of Units to promptly confirm or deny to the Trustees that such owner is a person whose
nationality or other status is or would be an issue in such a proceeding ("Ineligible Holder") and will constitute a demand to each Ineligible Holder that he dispose of his Units, to a party who would
not be an Ineligible Holder, within 30 days after the date of the Notice. 
         (ii)  If
an Ineligible Holder fails to dispose of his Units as required by the Notice, the Trustees will have the right to redeem and will redeem, during the 90 days
following the termination of the 30-day period specified in the Notice, any Unit not so transferred for a cash price equal to the mean between the
closing bid and ask prices of the Units in the over-the-counter market or, if the Units are then listed on a stock exchange, the closing price of the Units on the largest stock exchange on which the
Units are listed, on the last business day prior to the expiration of the 30-day period stated in the Notice. The procedures for any such purchase are more fully described in the Trust Agreement. The
Trustees will cancel any Units acquired in accordance with the foregoing procedures thereby increasing the proportionate interest in the Trust of other holders of Units. 
        (iii)  The
Trustees may, in their sole discretion, cause the Trust to borrow any amounts required to purchase Units in accordance with the procedures described above. 


 Liability of Unit Holders 
         It is the intention of the Working Interest Owners and the Trustees that the Trust be an "express trust" under the Texas Trust Act. Under Texas law, beneficiaries of an express trust are not personally liable for the obligations of the trust, even if the assets of the trust are insufficient to discharge its obligations. However, it is unclear under Texas law whether the Trust will be held to constitute an express trust and, if it is not held to be an express trust, whether the holders of Units would be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the Trust as would general partners of a partnership. 
         With respect to sales certificates issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which we refer to herein as the "FERC," although the FERC has the power to compel refunds, it has not compelled refunds from overriding royalty interest owners with respect to gas price overcharges. However, future laws, regulations or judicial decisions might permit the FERC or other governmental agencies to require such refunds from overriding royalty interest owners or create filing, reporting or certification obligations with respect to a trust created for such overriding royalty interest owners. Moreover, other parties, such as oil or gas purchasers, may be able to instigate private lawsuits or other legal action to compel refunds from overriding royalty interest owners with respect to oil or gas pricing overcharges. 
         The Working Interest Owners have agreed that they will not seek to recover from the Unit holders the amount of any refunds they are required to make, except out of future revenues payable to the Trust. The Trustees will be liable to the Unit holders if the Trustees allow any liability to be incurred without taking any and all action necessary to ensure that such liability will be payable only out of the 
 9

   Trust assets (regardless of whether the assets are adequate to satisfy the liability) and will be non-recourse to the Unit holders. However, the Trustees will not be liable to the Unit holders for state or federal income taxes or for refunds, fines, penalties or interest relating to oil or gas pricing overcharges under state or federal price controls. The Trustees will be indemnified from the Trust assets, to the extent that the Trustees' actions do not constitute gross negligence, bad faith or fraud. 
         Each Unit holder should consider, in weighing the possible exposure to liability in the event the Trust were not classified as an express trust, (1) the value and passive nature of the Trust assets, (2) the restrictions on the power of the Trustees to incur liabilities on behalf of the Trust and (3) the limited activities to be conducted by the Trustees. 
   Federal Income Tax Matters 
         This section is a summary of federal income tax matters of general application which addresses the material tax consequences of the ownership and sale of the Units. Except where indicated, the discussion below describes general federal income tax considerations applicable to individuals who are citizens or residents of the United States. Accordingly, the following discussion has limited application to domestic corporations and persons subject to specialized federal income tax treatment, such as regulated investment companies and insurance companies. It is impractical to comment on all aspects of federal, state, local and foreign laws that may affect the tax consequences of the transactions contemplated hereby and of an investment in the Units as they relate to the particular circumstances of every Unit holder. Each Unit holder is encouraged to consult his own tax advisor with respect to his particular circumstances. 
         This summary is based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), existing and proposed Treasury Regulations thereunder and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to changes that may be retroactively applied. Some of the applicable provisions of the Code have not been interpreted by the courts or the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). No assurance can be provided that the statements set forth herein (which do not bind the IRS or the courts) will not be challenged by the IRS or will be sustained by a court if so challenged. 
   Classification of the Trust 
         The IRS has ruled that the Trust is a grantor trust and that the Partnership is a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Thus, the Trust will incur no federal income tax liability and each Unit holder will be treated as owning an interest in the Partnership. 
         The Trustees assume that some Units are held by a middleman as such term is broadly defined in applicable Treasury Regulations (and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners, and brokers holding an interest for a custodian in street name). 
         Therefore, the Trustees consider the Trust to be a non-mortgage widely held fixed investment trust ("WHFIT") for federal income tax purposes. The Corporate Trustee, 919 Congress Avenue, Suite 500, Austin, Texas 78701, telephone number (512) 236-6599, is the representative of the Trust that will provide tax information in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a WHFIT. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the middlemen holding Units on behalf of Unit holders, and not the Trustees of the Trust, are solely responsible for complying with the information reporting requirements under the Treasury Regulations with respect to such Units, including the issuance of IRS Forms 1099 and certain written tax statements. Unit holders whose Units are held by middlemen should consult with such middlemen regarding the information that will be reported to them by the middlemen with respect to the Units. 
 10



  Income and Depletion 
         Each Unit holder of record as of the last business day of each quarter (the "Quarterly Record Date") will be allocated a share of the income and deductions of the Trust, including the Trust's share of the income and deductions of the Partnership, computed on an accrual basis, for that quarter. Royalty income is portfolio income. Since all income from the Partnership is Royalty income, this amount, net of depletion and severance taxes, is portfolio income and, subject to certain exceptions and transitional rules, this Royalty income cannot be offset by passive losses. Additionally, interest income is portfolio income. Administrative expense is an investment expense. 
         The IRS has also ruled that the Royalty is a non-operating economic interest giving rise to income subject to depletion. The Trustees will treat the Royalty as a single property giving rise to income subject to depletion, although the computation of depletion will be made by each Unit holder based upon information provided by the Trustees. Each Unit holder will be entitled to compute cost depletion with respect to his share of income from the Royalty based on his basis in the Royalty. A Unit holder will have a basis in the Royalty equal to the basis in his Units less any amount allocable to his share of any cash reserve account. Transferees of Units transferred after October 11, 1990, may be eligible to use the percentage depletion deduction on oil and gas income thereafter attributable to such Units, if the percentage depletion deduction would exceed cost depletion. Unlike cost depletion, percentage depletion is not limited to a Unit holder's depletable tax basis in the Units. Rather, a Unit holder may be entitled to a percentage depletion deduction as long as the Royalty generates gross income. 
         Amounts available for distribution for each quarterly period as determined by the Trustees are distributed to Unit holders of record on each Quarterly Record Date. See "Description of the UnitsDistributions" above. The terms of the Trust Agreement provide that taxable income attributable to such distributions will be reported to the Unit holder who receives such distributions, assuming that such holder is the holder of record on the Quarterly Record Date. In certain circumstances, however, a Unit holder may be required to report taxable income attributable to his or her Units but the Unit holder will not receive the distribution attributable to such income. For example, if the Trustees establish a reserve or borrow money to satisfy debts and liabilities of the Trust, income used to establish such reserve or to repay such loan will be reported by the Unit holder, even though such income is not distributed to the Unit holder. 
   Backup Withholding 
         Distributions from the Trust are generally subject to backup withholding at a rate of 28%. Backup withholding generally will not apply to distributions to a Unit holder unless the Unit holder fails to properly provide to the Trust his taxpayer identification number or the IRS notifies the Trust that the taxpayer identification number provided by the Unit holder is incorrect. 
 Sale of Units 
         Generally, except for recapture items, the sale, exchange or other disposition of a Unit will result in capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the tax basis in the Unit and the amount realized. Effective for property placed in service after December 31, 1986, the amount of gain, if any, realized upon the disposition of oil and gas property is treated as ordinary income to the extent of the intangible drilling and development costs incurred with respect to the property and depletion claimed with respect to the property to the extent it reduced the taxpayer's basis in the property. Under this provision, depletion attributable to a Unit acquired after 1986 will be subject to recapture as ordinary income upon disposition of the Unit or upon disposition of the oil and gas property to which the depletion is attributable. The balance of any gain or any loss will be capital gain or loss if the Unit was held by the Unit holder as a capital asset, either long-term or short-term depending on the holding period of the Unit. This capital gain or loss will be long-term if a Unit holder's holding period for the 
 11

   Unit exceeds one year at the time of sale or exchange. Capital gain or loss will be short-term if the Unit has not been held for more than one year at the time of sale or exchange. Under current law, the highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains of individuals is 20%. This rate is subject to change by new legislation at any time. The deductibility of capital losses are subject to certain limitations. 
   Additional Tax on Net Investment Income 
         A 3.8% tax applies to certain net investment income earned by individuals, estates, and trusts with income above certain thresholds. For these purposes, investment income would generally include certain income derived from investments such as the Units and gain realized by a Unit holder from a sale of Units. In the case of an individual, the tax will be imposed on the lesser of (i) the Unit holder's net investment income or (ii) the amount by which the Unit holder's modified adjusted gross income exceeds $250,000 (if the Unit holder is married and filing jointly or a surviving spouse), $125,000 (if the Unit holder is married and filing separately) or $200,000 (in any other case). 
   Non-U.S. Unit holders 
         In general, a Unit holder who is a nonresident alien individual or which is a foreign corporation, each a "non-U.S. Unit holder" for purposes of this discussion, will be subject to tax on the gross income (without taking into account any deductions, such as depletion) produced by the Royalty at a rate equal to 30%, or if applicable, at a lower treaty rate. This tax will be withheld by the Trustees and remitted directly to the United States Treasury. A non-U.S. Unit holder may elect to treat the income from the Royalty as effectively connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business under provisions of the Code, or pursuant to any similar provisions of applicable treaties. Upon making this election a non-U.S. Unit holder is entitled to claim all deductions with respect to that income, but he must file a United States federal income tax return to claim those deductions. This election once made is irrevocable, unless an applicable treaty allows the election to be made annually. However, that effectively connected taxable income is subject to withholding at the highest applicable tax rate, currently 39.6% for individual non-U.S. Unit holders. 
         The Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder treat the Trust as if it were a United States real property holding corporation. Accordingly, a non-U.S. Unit holder may be subject to United States federal income tax on any gain from the disposition of his Units if he meets certain ownership thresholds. 
         In addition, if a foreign corporation elects under provisions of the Code to treat the income from the Royalty as effectively connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business, the corporation may also be subject to the U.S. branch profits tax at a rate of 30%. This tax is imposed on U.S. branch profits of a foreign corporation that are not reinvested in the U.S. trade or business. This tax is in addition to the tax on effectively connected income. The branch profits tax may be either reduced or eliminated by treaty. 
         Pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (commonly referred to as "FATCA"), distributions from the Trust to "foreign financial institutions" and certain other "non-financial foreign entities" may be subject to U.S. withholding taxes. Specifically, certain "withholdable payments" (including certain royalties, interest and other gains or income from U.S. sources) made to a foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity will generally be subject to the withholding tax unless the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity complies with certain information reporting, withholding, identification, certification and related requirements imposed by FATCA. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules.

           Federal income taxation of a non-U.S. Unit holder is a highly complex matter which may be affected by many other considerations. Therefore, each non-U.S. Unit holder is encouraged to consult its own tax advisor with respect to its ownership of Units. 
   Tax-exempt Organizations 
         Investments in publicly traded grantor trusts are treated the same as investments in partnerships for purposes of the rules governing unrelated business taxable income. Royalty income and interest income should not be unrelated business taxable income so long as, generally, a Unit holder did not incur debt to acquire a Unit or otherwise incur or maintain a debt that would not have been incurred or maintained if that Unit had not been acquired. Legislative proposals have been made from time to time which, if adopted, would result in the treatment of Royalty income as unrelated business taxable income. Each tax-exempt Unit holder is encouraged to consult its own tax advisor with respect to its ownership of Units and the treatment of Royalty income. 
 State Law Considerations 
         The Trust and the Partnership have been structured so as to cause the Units to be treated for certain state law purposes essentially the same as other securities, that is, as interests in intangible personal property rather than as interests in real property. However, in the absence of controlling legal precedent, there is a possibility that under certain circumstances a Unit holder could be treated as owning an interest in real property under the laws of Louisiana. In that event, the tax, probate, devolution of title and administration laws of Louisiana or other states applicable to real property may apply to the Units, even if held by a person who is not a resident thereof. Application of these laws could make the inheritance and related matters with respect to the Units substantially more onerous than had the Units been treated as interests in intangible personal property. Unit holders are encouraged to consult their legal and tax advisors regarding the applicability of these considerations to their individual circumstances. 
         Texas does not impose an income tax. Therefore, no part of the income produced by the Trust is subject to an income tax in Texas. However, Texas imposes a tax on gross revenues less certain deductions, as specifically set forth in the Texas franchise tax statute. Entities subject to tax generally include trusts unless otherwise exempt, and most other types of entities having limited liability protection. Trusts and partnerships that receive at least 90% of their federal gross income from designated passive sources, including royalties from mineral properties and other non-operated mineral interest income, and do not receive more than 10% of their income from operating an active trade or business, are generally exempt from the Texas franchise tax as "passive entities." The Trust should be exempt from Texas franchise tax as a "passive entity." Since the Trust should be exempt from Texas franchise tax at the Trust level as a passive entity, each Unit holder that is considered a taxable entity under the Texas franchise tax would generally be required to include its Texas portion of Trust revenues in its own Texas franchise tax computation. Each Unit holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor regarding its possible Texas franchise tax liability. 
      STATUS OF THE TRUST 
        As described in more detail in "Legal ProceedingsProbate Proceeding" in Item 3 of this Form 10-K, the Petition for Modification and Termination of the Trust (the "Petition") filed by the Trustees with the Probate Court of Travis County, Texas (the "Court") requested that the Court modify the Trust Agreement to (1) allow for the termination of the Trust by a court order, and (2) allow the Trustees, as necessary to fulfill the purposes of the Trust and without Unit holder approval to (a) sell all or any portion of the Trust's interests in the Partnership or any other assets of the Trust, (b) exercise their rights to dissolve the Partnership, or (c) cause the Partnership to sell the Royalty. The goals in filing such probate proceeding (the "Probate Proceeding") were to permit the Trustees to direct the 
 13

   Partnership to sell the Royalty; to distribute the net proceeds resulting from such sale, after payment of the Trust's liabilities, to the Unit holders; and, to, thereafter terminate the Partnership and the Trust. The 2016 Royalty Sale was made pursuant to the Probate Proceeding. It is anticipated that once the Remaining Matters are resolved the Trust will be terminated. Upon termination of the Trust, the Trust will make a final distribution to Unit holders of any funds held by the Trust in accordance with the final resolution of the Probate Proceeding.
