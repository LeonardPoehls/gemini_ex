Overview 
 Zymeworks is an innovative, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of next-generation multifunctional biotherapeutics. Our suite of complementary therapeutic platforms and our fully integrated drug development engine provide the flexibility and compatibility to precisely engineer and develop highly differentiated product candidates. These capabilities have resulted in multiple wholly owned product candidates with the potential to drive superior outcomes in large underserved and unaddressed patient populations, as further described below. 
 Our lead product candidate, ZW25, is a novel bispecific (dual-targeting) antibody which targets two distinct domains of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2. In our adaptive Phase 1 clinical trial, ZW25 has been well tolerated with promising single agent anti-tumor activity in patients with heavily pretreated HER2-expressing cancers that have progressed after standard of care, including multiple HER2-targeted regimens. Its unique design may enable ZW25 to address patient populations with all levels of HER2 expression, including those with low to intermediate HER2-expressing tumors, who are otherwise limited to chemotherapy or hormone therapy. Approximately 81% of patients with HER2-expressing breast cancer and 57% of patients with HER2-expressing gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer have tumors that express low to intermediate levels of HER2, making them ineligible for treatment with currently approved HER2-targeted therapies, such as Herceptin and Perjeta, which generated combined sales of $9.5 billion in 2017. Our second product candidate, ZW49, capitalizes on the unique design of ZW25 and is a bispecific antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, based on the same antibody framework as ZW25 but armed with our proprietary ZymeLink-cytotoxic (potent cancer cell-killing) payload. ZW49 is being advanced in lieu of our prior product candidate, ZW33, based on ZW49s superior therapeutic window (range of doses that are both efficacious and tolerable) and proprietary linker and cytotoxic payload. We designed ZW49 to be a best-in-class HER2-targeting ADC for several indications characterized by HER2 expression, for which we expect to file an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application in 2018. We are also advancing a deep pipeline of preclinical product candidates and discovery-stage programs in immuno-oncology and other therapeutic areas. In addition to our wholly owned pipeline, two of our therapeutic platforms have been further leveraged through multiple revenue-generating strategic partnerships with the following global pharmaceutical companies: Merck Sharp & Dohme Research GmbH (Merck), Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), Celgene Corporation and Celgene Alpine Investment Co. LLC (Celgene), GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Development Limited (GSK), Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. (Daiichi Sankyo) and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen). 
 Our proprietary capabilities and technologies include four modular, complementary therapeutic platforms that can be easily used in combination with each other and with existing approaches. This ability to layer technologies without compromising manufacturability enables us to engineer next-generation biotherapeutics with synergistic activity, which we believe will result in superior patient outcomes. Our core platforms include: 
 

 | Azymetric, our bispecific platform, which enables therapeutic antibodies to bind two distinct locations on a target, known as epitopes. This is achieved by tailoring multiple configurations of the antibodys Fab regions (locations on the antibody to which epitopes bind);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ZymeLink, our ADC platform which comprises multiple cytotoxic payloads and the linker technology used to couple these payloads to tumor-targeting antibodies or proteins. This platform can be used in conjunction with our other therapeutic platforms to increase safety and efficacy as compared to existing ADC technologies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | EFECT, which enables finely tuned modulation (both up and down) of immune cell recruitment and function; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | AlbuCORE, our antibody-alternative platform, which augments the properties of naturally occurring human serum albumin, or HSA, with multivalent (multi-targeted) binding to enable complex mechanisms of action that are not amenable to antibody-based approaches.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our protein engineering expertise and proprietary structure-guided molecular modeling capabilities enable these therapeutic platforms. Together with our internal antibody discovery and generation technologies, we have established a fully integrated drug development engine and toolkit that is capable of rapidly delivering a steady pipeline of next-generation product candidates in oncology and other therapeutic areas. 
 Our lead product candidate, ZW25, is an Azymetric bispecific antibody, which simultaneously binds two non-overlapping epitopes of HER2 resulting in dual HER2 signal blockade and increased tumor cell binding, immune cell recruitment and HER2 receptor downregulation as compared to existing HER2-targeted therapies. In our adaptive Phase 1 clinical trial, ZW25 has been well tolerated with promising single agent anti-tumor activity in patients with heavily pretreated HER2-expressing cancers that have progressed after standard of care treatment, including multiple HER2-targeted regimens. These data were highlighted at several medical conferences in 2017, including the annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, the European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, or SABCS. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted Orphan Drug Designation to ZW25 for the treatment of gastric and ovarian cancer. Our second product candidate, ZW49, is a bispecific anti-HER2 ADC that is based on the same antibody framework as ZW25, but is armed with our proprietary ZymeLink cytotoxic payload. We will continue to focus on advancing multiple well-differentiated product candidates into clinical trials to build our pipeline portfolio as well as exploiting our protein engineering expertise to develop innovative therapeutic platforms. 
 Our unique combination of proprietary protein engineering capabilities and resulting therapeutic platform technologies was initially recognized by Merck and Lilly, with whom we established strategic partnerships focused on our Azymetric and EFECT therapeutic platforms. We subsequently entered into broader strategic partnerships with Celgene and GSK, followed by a collaboration and cross-licensing agreement with Daiichi Sankyo. During the initial partnerships with Merck, Lilly and GSK, the relationships were expanded to include either additional licenses or therapeutic platforms. Most recently, we executed a licensing and collaboration agreement with Janssen to develop and commercialize next-generation bispecific antibody therapeutics. These relationships provide our strategic partners with access to components of our proprietary Azymetric and EFECT therapeutic platforms for their development of a defined number of protein therapeutics on a predominantly non-target-exclusive basis. Importantly, these strategic partnerships have provided Zymeworks with non-dilutive funding as well as access to proprietary therapeutic assets, which increase our ability to rapidly advance our product candidates while maintaining worldwide commercial rights to our wholly owned therapeutic pipeline. 
 The mission that unites everyone at Zymeworks is to create biotherapeutics that allow patients to return home to their loved ones, disease free. We intend to advance the development of disruptive therapeutic platforms and impactful biotherapeutics, especially in areas of unmet need. We believe we are well-positioned to deliver on our mission. 
 Segment Financial Information 
 The Company currently operates in one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete information is available for the chief operating decision maker (CODM), or decision-making group, deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The Company operates and manages its business in one segment, which is the discovery, development and commercialization of next-generation biotherapeutics. 
Overview of our Proprietary Therapeutic Platforms 
 Our expertise in protein engineering has enabled the development of our proprietary therapeutic platforms, a complementary suite of highly tailored biologics solutions. Our therapeutic platforms can be used alone, or in combination, with synergistic activity to develop multifunctional fit-for-purpose biotherapeutics with bispecific capabilities (Azymetric), cytotoxic payload delivery (ZymeLink), finely tuned immune function modulation (EFECT) and multivalent targeting (AlbuCORE). The modular design and ease of use of our therapeutic platforms allow for the design and evaluation of multiple candidates with different formats to determine the optimal therapeutic combination early in development. We continue to leverage these therapeutic platforms to expand our pipeline of next-generation biotherapeutics that we believe could represent significant improvements to the standard of care in multiple cancer types.

We believe our in-house biologics design and engineering capabilities confer significant competitive advantages to our therapeutic platforms and are ultimately reflected in our programs. Some of these key advantages are: 
 

 | Highly modular and customizable. Our platforms can be combined in multiple ways and this capability has achieved synergistic results in preclinical studies. For example, our ZymeLink platform enables the attachment of cytotoxic payloads to the candidates in any of our other platforms to create enhanced therapeutics, such as ADCs. These capabilities allow us to finely tune characteristics such as tumor-killing potential, target specificity and immune cell engagement, and expand our ability to engineer superior drugs against multiple cancers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Fit-for-purpose. Our platforms can also be utilized to engineer biotherapeutics that are tailored for the particular target and disease state. For example, Azymetric bispecifics can be developed with multiple antigen binding formats to provide specific engagement geometry for a given target. This allows us to identify the targets and diseases that we wish to exploit and then engineer an optimized biotherapeutic to maximize therapeutic effect. We believe this method of deliberate drug development is a more effective and efficient mechanism for the creation of next-generation biotherapeutics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Consistent with native (Antibody or Albumin) formats. Our antibody platforms are differentiated from our competitors and have been engineered to retain the desirable biophysical characteristics of native antibody (Immunoglobulin, or IgG) formats such as a low risk of provoking an adverse anti-drug immune response, or immunogenicity, superior pharmacokinetics, the ability to beneficially recruit the immune system through effector function, and ease of manufacturing and purification. Likewise, our AlbuCORE platform builds on native HSA, and exploits the natural accumulation of albumin in tumors which we believe may lead to enhanced targeting of the tumor.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Readily scalable and transferable. Our in-house biologics design and engineering expertise and infrastructure is positioned to create a steady stream of product candidates that are scalable, efficient to manufacture (by us, a partner or contract manufacturing organization), and naturally endorse favorable characteristics such as high production and purity levels. We believe this is a significant competitive advantage given the historical challenges faced by others in the field who manufacture complex biologics, such as bispecifics and ADCs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Azymetric Bispecific Antibody Platform 
 The Azymetric platform consists of a library of proprietary amino acid substitutions that enable the transformation of monospecific antibodies into bispecific antibodies, which gives them the ability to simultaneously bind two non-overlapping epitopes. Azymetric bispecific technology enables the development of biotherapeutics with dual-targeting of receptors/ligands and simultaneous blockade of multiple signaling pathways, increasing tumor-specific targeting and efficacy while reducing toxicities and the potential for drug resistance. In preclinical studies, the dual-targeting of Azymetric antibodies has demonstrated synergistic activity relative to the application of an equivalent dose of the corresponding monospecific antibodies. Azymetric bispecifics can also be engineered to enhance internalization of the antibody into the tumor cell and consequently increase the delivery of cytotoxic payloads. 
 First-generation bispecific platforms significantly alter the structure of monoclonal antibodies or rely upon complex and proprietary manufacturing processes. Azymetric bispecifics, in contrast, retain the desirable drug-like qualities of monoclonal antibodies, including long half-life, stability and low immunogenic potential, which increases their probability of success. Azymetric bispecifics are also compatible with standard manufacturing processes with high production yields and purity, which accelerates manufacturing timelines and reduces costs. 
 ZymeLink Conjugation Platform and Cytotoxins 
 The ZymeLink conjugation platform is a suite of novel site-specific protein coupling technologies and customizable cleavable linkers that allow for the delivery of our proprietary cytotoxic payloads, which can be applied to all of our antibody and albumin-based therapeutic platforms. We believe that ZymeLink provides multiple competitive advantages over existing approaches, including optimized activity and tolerability profiles through increased drug delivery to target cells with reduced off-target effects, product homogeneity, preservation of immune cell interaction and stable pharmacokinetics. 
 EFECT Antibody Effector Function Modulation Platform 
 The EFECT platform comprises sets of modifications to the crystallizable fragment, or Fc, region of antibodies that enable the selective modulation of recruited cytotoxic immune cells for diverse therapeutic applications. This allows us to rationally tailor the selective enhancement or elimination of immune effector function to optimize product candidates. 
 AlbuCORE Multispecific Antibody-Alternative Platform 
 The AlbuCORE platform is a novel and proprietary suite of multivalent scaffolds engineered from the HSA backbone from which therapeutics can be developed. This platform is highly flexible and enables the addition of up to four customized targeting domains, which allows for additional tumor specificity and synergistic activity as well as an increase in the affinity and selectivity for a desired target. The resulting superstructure naturally accumulates in tumor microenvironments or areas of inflammation, and benefits from several attractive attributes of HSA, including superior pharmacokinetics and stability. Additionally, these AlbuCORE constructs possess standard manufacturing and purification protocols compatible with industry-standard conjugation technologies, which accelerate the manufacturing process, while reducing costs.

Product Candidate Pipeline and Advanced Preclinical and Discovery Programs 
 We currently have one wholly owned product candidate in clinical development and several wholly owned product candidates in preclinical development that leverage our multiple therapeutic platforms to address areas of significant unmet medical need. We define our programs as lead product candidates when they initiate IND-enabling studies and as preclinical stage programs when lead molecules have been identified and demonstrate activity in biological models. Our lead product candidates, ZW25 and ZW49, utilize our Azymetric bispecific platform to address patient populations with all levels of HER2 expression, including those with low to intermediate HER2-expressing tumors, and are described in detail below. We are also actively advancing a diverse set of preclinical and discovery programs, which leverage one or more of our proprietary therapeutic platforms to create multifunctional biotherapeutics for several solid tumor indications. Our bispecific ADC programs utilize the Azymetric, EFECT and ZymeLink platforms and have demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies with the potential for an enhanced therapeutic window. Our most advanced T cell-engaging bispecific program leverages the Azymetric and EFECT platforms combined with our proprietary protein engineering expertise, which results in potent anti-tumor activity and reduced toxicity in preclinical studies. We are also developing several checkpoint-modulating bispecifics for immuno-oncology and other therapeutic areas to create a deep pipeline of well-differentiated product candidates. The table below summarizes our current product candidate pipeline.

 | ZW25 is our lead product candidate currently being evaluated in an adaptive Phase 1 clinical trial in the United States, based on our Azymetric platform. It is a bispecific antibody that can simultaneously bind two non-overlapping epitopes, known as biparatopic binding, of HER2 resulting in dual HER2 signal blockade, increased binding and removal of HER2 protein from the cell surface, and enhanced effector function. These combined mechanisms of action have led to significant anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of breast cancer, including trastuzumab (currently branded as Herceptin) resistant high HER2-expressing tumors, as well as in tumors with lower levels of HER2 expression. Approximately 81% of patients with HER2-expressing breast cancer and 57% of patients with HER2-expressing gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer have tumors that express low to intermediate levels of HER2, making them ineligible for treatment with currently approved HER2-targeted therapies, such as Herceptin and Perjeta. In the United States and EU5 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) alone, approximately 408,000 and 50,000 patients are diagnosed with HER2-expressing breast and gastroesophageal cancer, respectively, every year. In addition, multiple other cancers, including ovarian, bladder, colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, also express HER2 at varying levels. Therefore, there is a significant unmet need for HER2-targeted agents that can effectively treat these patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are developing ZW25 as a best-in-class HER2-targeting antibody intended as a treatment option for patients with any solid tumor that expresses HER2. Our initial focus is on the treatment of patients with breast or gastric cancers that have progressed after treatment with HER2-targeted therapies or that are not eligible for approved HER2-targeted therapies based on low to intermediate levels of HER2 expression. We then intend to develop ZW25 for other HER2-expressing cancers. ZW25 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of both gastric and ovarian cancer by the FDA. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, ZW25 has been well tolerated with promising single agent anti-tumor activity in patients with heavily pretreated HER2-expressing cancers that have progressed after standard of care treatment, including multiple HER2-targeted regimens. 
 

 | ZW49 is a biparatopic anti-HER2 ADC that is based on the same antibody framework as ZW25 and its predecessor product candidate, ZW33, and takes advantage of high levels of ZW25s antibody-targeted internalization to deliver our proprietary ZymeLink cytotoxic payload. ZW49 and ZW33 were being developed in parallel; however, we made the strategic decision to advance ZW49 as a lead product candidate in lieu of ZW33 based on ZW49s superior therapeutic window attributable to its use of our proprietary ZymeLink ADC platform. We are developing ZW49 as a best-in-class HER2-targeting ADC for several indications characterized by HER2 expression, especially for patients whose tumors have progressed or are refractory to HER2-targeted agents and those that express lower levels of HER2 and are ineligible for treatment with HER2-targeted therapies including Kadcyla. We plan on filing an IND application for ZW49 in 2018.

Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to leverage our next-generation therapeutic platforms and proprietary protein engineering capabilities to become a domain dominator in the discovery, development and commercialization of best-in-class multifunctional biotherapeutics for the treatment of cancer and other diseases with high unmet medical need. 
 Our key strategies to achieve this goal are to: 
 

 | Aggressively advance our lead product candidate, ZW25, through the clinic in multiple HER2-expressing tumor types. We plan to pursue the most rapid path possible to advance ZW25 through clinical trials and towards commercialization. We believe ZW25 is best positioned to initially treat patients with high HER2-expressing breast or gastric cancers that have progressed after treatment with HER2-targeted therapies, such as Herceptin and Perjeta, or that are not eligible for approved HER2-targeted therapies based on low to intermediate levels of HER2 expression. A first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial for ZW25 commenced in September 2016 and consists of three segments. We have completed the dose escalation segment (Part 1) and enrollment is underway for Part 2 of the study in which ZW25 will be administered every other week at 20 mg/kg in five expansion cohorts that will span HER2 High breast, HER2 High gastric, HER2 Intermediate breast, HER2 Intermediate gastric and other HER2 gene amplified cancers to evaluate ZW25 as both a monotherapy (Part 2) and in combination with standard of care therapy (Part 3). In our Phase 1 clinical trial, ZW25 has been well tolerated with promising single agent anti-tumor activity in patients with HER2-expressing cancer that have progressed after standard of care, including multiple HER2-targeted regimens.

 | Pursue a rapid and multi-faceted development strategy for our novel and highly differentiated pipeline into clinical trials across many oncology indications with a critically high unmet medical need. Our second product candidate, ZW49, is a bispecific ADC that capitalizes on the unique design of ZW25 and is armed with our proprietary ZymeLink cytoxic payload. We are able to realize significant cost and time savings for ZW49 relative to other bispecifics by leveraging the same antibody manufacturing processes as well as insights related to the safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and anti-tumor activity data generated for ZW25 in both the preclinical and clinical setting since they share an identical bispecific antibody backbone. The planned clinical trials will be designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose in the dose escalation phase before exploring safety and anti-tumor activity in patients whose tumors express all levels of HER2, including those with low to intermediate HER2-expression, that are not eligible for treatment with HER2-targeted therapies. Our subsequent clinical product candidates will be chosen from a diverse set of programs that we are aggressively advancing through preclinical development in several oncology indications with significant unmet need. These product candidates leverage both novel and well-validated targets and take advantage of one or more of our proprietary therapeutic platforms, which we believe results in a deep pipeline of next-generation multifunctional biotherapeutics.

 | Leverage our therapeutic platforms and proprietary protein engineering capabilities to continue to discover and develop additional novel product candidates. We will continue to exploit the advantages of our therapeutic platforms to discover and develop novel product candidates with a focus on leveraging our Azymetric, ZymeLink, EFECT and AlbuCORE platforms for generating bispecific and multifunctional antibody therapeutics, drug conjugates and multispecific antibody alternatives. We are currently evaluating a number of disease targets, therapeutic candidates and cytotoxic payloads with the aim of advancing a steady pipeline of next-generation product candidates from discovery and preclinical research into clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Leverage our strategic partnerships, while pursuing additional collaborations that can augment the power of our platforms and value of our pipeline. We will continue to work closely with our strategic partners to help advance multiple programs developed using our therapeutic platforms. These strategic partnerships underscore the strengths of our therapeutic platforms, provide non-dilutive funding, broaden the scope of development efforts and have the potential to provide clinical validation. We plan to opportunistically enter into additional or expanded strategic relationships with top-tier biopharmaceutical companies, including retaining key geographic and commercial rights, particularly in disease areas not currently being pursued by us or by our current strategic partners.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continue to develop innovative therapeutic platforms and expand our therapeutic focus into logical areas such as autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases. We plan to advance novel first-in-class product candidates and to continue to develop next-generation therapeutic platforms through our in-house research and development activities.

Background 
 Immune System and Antibodies 
 The immune system detects and defends organisms from invading pathogens, and identifies and eliminates aberrant cells. It is comprised of two subsystems: the innate and adaptive immune systems. The innate immune system mounts non-specific responses to conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns and to alarm signals released by pathogen-infected cells. Key components of the innate immune system include: 
 
7 
 

 | cytokines and chemokines, which are small signaling proteins that allow immune cells to communicate with one another and regulate cell movement towards a site of inflammation or infection;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the complement pathway, which is a system of interacting proteins that coat pathogens, mark them for destruction and induce inflammatory responses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | macrophages, which are cells that ingest and destroy foreign materials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | neutrophils, which are cells that ingest and destroy microorganisms and are also capable of releasing enzymes that kill microorganisms; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | natural killer, or NK, cells, which recognize and lyse pathogenic cells.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In contrast to innate immunity, the adaptive immune system mounts highly specific responses against non-self molecules, or antigens, and can be activated by the innate immune system. Key components of the adaptive immune system include: 
 

 | B cells, which generate unique antibodies targeting intact extracellular antigens;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | helper T cells, which stimulate B cells to divide, differentiate and secrete antibodies in response to peptide antigens processed from extracellular proteins presented by other immune cells; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | cytotoxic T cells, which destroy infected or cancerous cells presenting peptide antigens processed from intracellular proteins.

 Oncology Overview and Next-Generation Therapy 
 Cancer treatment depends on multiple factors, including the type, stage and degree of localization of the cancer. Small, localized tumors can often be effectively treated by surgery and radiation, and supplemental, or adjuvant, drugs are commonly administered in this setting. Patients with primary tumors that cannot be removed or which have metastasized beyond the primary site are typically treated with systemically delivered drugs, such as chemotherapy. 
 Chemotherapy 
 Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents were the first type of systemic drug treatment developed for cancer and many remain in use today. These drugs typically act by disrupting cellular metabolism, division and mobility, which are required for tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. Tumors are more sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents than normal cells by virtue of their accelerated proliferation rates. However, chemotherapy also kills normal cells, particularly those that naturally grow and divide rapidly, such as those in the gastrointestinal tract. Because of this toxicity, these agents are typically administered in a limited range of doses within which tumors can be eliminated while minimizing toxic side effects, resulting in a narrow therapeutic window. As a result, chemotherapeutic agents are not always effective in eradicating cancer cells at doses low enough to avoid potentially fatal toxic damage. 
Targeted Therapies 
 To address the broad toxicity of systemic chemotherapy, researchers have developed targeted therapies that interfere with the specific molecules that drive the rapid growth of cancer cells and lead to metastasis, or which can re-engage the immune system to combat cancer. While each patients cancer is characterized by a unique combination of genetic mutations, many of these changes are common across many cancers. These common genetic changes are targeted by newer targeted therapies that discriminate cancerous from normal cells, often leading to superior tolerability and broader therapeutic windows compared to chemotherapy. The three most common classes of targeted therapies are as follows: 
 
8 
 
Small Molecules 
 Small molecule therapeutics are chemical compounds that generally interfere with the intracellular signaling of tyrosine kinases. Tyrosine kinase signaling regulates cell growth, proliferation, migration and new blood vessel formation, or angiogenesis, of tumors. Blocking these signals slows the growth of tumors. Small molecule therapeutics, due to their small size and the weaker binding of targets, are generally less specific and more toxic than biologics. 
 First-Generation Biologics 
 Most biologics used as cancer therapies are monoclonal antibodies directed against tumor cell surface antigens, though this class of therapeutics also includes vaccines, cytokines and receptor fusion proteins. Due to their high degree of target specificity, monoclonal antibodies also offer the unique ability to target tumor-selective antigens, while minimizing off-target side effects. In oncology, first-generation biologics were generally used for growth-signal neutralization through ligand or receptor blockade or degradation such as Herceptin or Perjeta for the HER2 receptor and Erbitux for the epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR. 
 Second-Generation Biologics 
 Second-generation biologics were designed to further increase efficacy and reduce toxicity of targeted cancer therapies. In some instances, the domain of a monoclonal antibody was engineered to enhance therapeutic efficacy, or the Fab domains were engineered to improve target antigen affinity and specificity. In addition, small molecules or cytokines could be conjugated to antibodies to precisely deliver toxic payloads specifically to tumors. Antibodies could also be engineered such that they simultaneously engaged multiple different antigens (i.e., bispecific antibodies) and induced biological effects previously unattainable with first-generation monoclonal antibodies. This resulted in biologics often being the preferred treatment option for many cancers given their higher efficacy and safety profile as well as longer serum exposure in comparison to small molecules. 
 Zymeworks Next-Generation Biologics 
 Small molecule therapeutics and biologics have led to improvements in patient outcomes compared to chemotherapies. However, some patients acquire resistance, become refractory to, or cannot tolerate the increased toxicity of these treatments. Importantly, these treatments often only delay disease progression and do not induce durable cancer remission. As a result, there is a need for new therapies with improved, long-lasting efficacy and reduced toxicity. We believe the future of oncology will be defined by multifunctional therapeutics specifically designed to act through several synergistic mechanisms of action to enhance efficacy, overcome resistance and minimize side effects. Furthermore, we believe our proprietary protein engineering capabilities and our integrated biologics discovery engine uniquely enable us to develop the next generation of biotherapeutics, including bispecific and multifunctional antibodies, immune engagers, ADCs and other proprietary protein formats to help address this treatment gap. Our suite of proprietary therapeutic platforms uniquely allows us to utilize all of the above approaches in our mission to allow patients to return home to their loved ones, disease free. 
Zymeworks Competitive Advantage: Proprietary Therapeutic Platforms 
 Our expertise in protein engineering has enabled the development of our next-generation therapeutic platforms, a suite of complementary and highly tailored biologics solutions. Our therapeutic platforms can be used alone or in combination with synergistic activity to develop fit for purpose biotherapeutics with bispecific capabilities (Azymetric), cytotoxic payload delivery (ZymeLink), finely tuned immune cell regulation (EFECT) and multivalent targeting (AlbuCORE). We continue to leverage these therapeutic platforms to expand our deep pipeline of next-generation biotherapeutics that we believe could represent significant improvements to the standard of care in multiple cancer types.

Azymetric Bispecific Antibody Platform 
 The Azymetric platform consists of a library of proprietary amino acid substitutions in the Fc and Fab regions that transform monospecific antibodies into bispecific antibodies, giving them the ability to simultaneously bind two non-overlapping epitopes. The core technology consists of complementary amino acid substitutions on each of the CH3 domains that we have engineered to facilitate the obligate interaction of two distinct heavy chains. Additional amino acid substitutions are also introduced at the heavy-light chain interfaces to facilitate the correct pairing of the heavy chains with their respective light chains. 
 We are leveraging the multiple therapeutic mechanisms of action of our Azymetric platform to develop our internal pipeline of wholly owned bispecific product candidates, including ZW25 and ZW49. We have also licensed the Azymetric platform to our strategic partners (Merck, Lilly, Celgene, GSK, Daiichi Sankyo and Janssen) for their own therapeutic development. 
 We have engineered our Azymetric bispecific antibodies to retain the desirable features of naturally occurring IgG antibodies, including low immunogenicity, long serum half-life, high stability and the ability to mediate effector function. Azymetric antibodies are also manufactured using industry-standard monoclonal antibody processes and maintain high production yields and product purity. This allows for plug-and-play, low-cost, high-quality manufacturing for both our proprietary and partnered product candidates. These are significant advantages compared to competing bispecific technologies, which in many cases suffer from poor stability or may require additional complex manufacturing steps. By retaining the properties of an unmodified Fc region, Azymetric antibodies can be stably formulated, dosed on a convenient schedule, and have the ability to kill tumors through multiple mechanisms of action. In addition, Azymetric antibodies are compatible with glyco-engineering and other Fc modifications (for example, our EFECT platform) to enhance therapeutic activity. 
 Unique Mechanisms of Action of Bispecific Antibodies 
 Bispecific antibodies can mediate effects through multiple unique mechanisms of action, including: (i) enhanced receptor clustering, which may accelerate internalization and promote sub-cellular sorting to the lysosome for improved cytotoxin delivery; (ii) recruitment of immune cells to tumor cells by simultaneous engagement of receptors on each cell; (iii) increasing tumor cell decoration by engaging two targets on the same receptor, or two different receptors, to enhance Fc-mediated effector cell function; (iv) improved specificity of tumor targeting by requiring engagement of two tumor-associated antigens; (v) dual receptor blockade with a single antibody to suppress signaling through two oncogenic pathways (the same effect can be achieved by dual ligand binding); or (vi) by bridging proteins to replace a missing component of a macromolecular complex. Other unique bispecific mechanisms of action include delivering biologics across the blood brain barrier, enhancing tumor cell death signaling by improved receptor clustering, and increasing cytotoxin delivery by coupling a poorly internalizing tumor-specific receptor to a well-internalizing target. 
 Unlike many other bispecific platforms, the Azymetric platform is compatible with alternative antigen binding formats (e.g. antigen binding fragments, or Fabs, single chain antibodies, or scFvs, and heavy chain antibodies, or VHHs, see illustration below). This flexibility allows us to explore multiple different structural variants and to select the format that provides optimized engagement geometry for a given target pair to maximize therapeutic effect for the desired biology. We believe that this level of therapeutic customization will be essential to design next-generation biologics that effectively target increasingly complex biological challenges.

Azymetric Format Variants. Azymetric antibodies can be formatted with dual Fab antigen-targeting arms, with common light chains, in alternate scFv or VHH formats, hybrid formats, or as ADCs, in order to create highly tailored biotherapeutics that provide optimal engagement geometry for a given target pair to maximize therapeutic effect. 
 We have designed the Azymetric platform to provide us with the following competitive advantages:

 ZymeLink Conjugation Platform and Cytotoxins 
 The ZymeLink conjugation platform represents a suite of novel site-specific protein conjugation technologies and customizable cleavable linkers that enable the delivery of cytotoxic payloads, and can be applied to all of our antibody and albumin-based therapeutic scaffolds. The ZymeLink platform enables the production of homogeneous product candidates that are stable in circulation but enable the efficient release of payload upon internalization by target cells. For antibodies, the ZymeLink platform has been specifically engineered to preserve Fc effector function to facilitate the recruitment and activation of immune cells as well as maintain typical antibody pharmacokinetics. 
 We have also developed a series of proprietary cytotoxic payloads, spanning multiple classes, which possess highly potent anti-tumor activity against a broad range of cancer cell types. When conjugated to tumor-targeting antibodies, the resulting ZymeLink-cytotoxin conjugates demonstrate exceptional anti-tumor activity and tolerability in vivo in our preclinical studies. In fact, the ZymeLink-cytotoxin conjugates are tolerated by non-human primates at doses six-fold higher than the only currently approved cleavable ADC platform based on monomethyl auristatin E, or MMAE, potentially resulting in an expanded therapeutic window in patients. This key competitive advantage may enable administration of higher ADC doses and delivery of more cytotoxin to the tumor, with reduced toxic side effects, relative to other ADC platforms. 
 We have designed the ZymeLink platform to provide us with the following competitive advantages: 
 

 | targeted delivery of our proprietary next-generation cytotoxins
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | optimizes efficacy and safety profiles thus broadening the therapeutic window;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | customized cleavable linkers with optimized loading, stability and release
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | maximizes drug delivery to target cells while minimizing off-target effects;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | site-specific conjugation technology
--+-------------------------------------


 | ensures product homogeneity, preserves Fc effector function for recruitment/activation of immune cells, and maintains pharmacokinetics through FcRn engagement; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | compatible with multiple antibody and protein formats including Azymetric, AlbuCORE and our partnered programs
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | maximizes utility across a broad range of applications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 Importantly, the ZymeLink conjugation platform is compatible with our proprietary cytotoxins as well as a variety of additional small molecule therapeutics. Together, they can be combined with traditional monoclonal antibodies and with the Azymetric (bispecific), EFECT and AlbuCORE (multispecific) platforms to enable the development of best-in-class, life-changing therapies for patients. 
 EFECT Antibody Effector Function Modulation Platform 
 Immune cells bind to the Fc region of antibodies through proteins called Fc receptors. When bound, some Fc receptors activate immune cell function (FcgRIIa and FcgRIIIa), while other Fc receptors inhibit immune cell function (FcgRIIb). This phenomenon is known as effector function. The EFECT platform is comprised of proprietary sets of amino acid modifications to the Fc region of antibody-based therapeutics, which enable us to selectively modulate their effector function (Effector Function Eliminating, Effector Function Enhancing or Immune Inhibitory) and tailor the activity of recruited immune cells for specific therapeutic applications. As an example, for the development of T cell re-directing bispecific antibodies, using the Effector Function Eliminating modifications prevents binding between the antibodys Fc region and the Fc receptors of immune cells, which may otherwise lead to inadvertent toxicity. Alternatively, for more traditional anti-cancer therapeutic antibodies, using the Effector Function Enhancing modifications improves binding between the antibodys Fc region and activating Fc receptors, which may enhance immune cell-mediated anti-cancer activity. The ability to tune-up, tune-down, or eliminate immune cell engagement allows tailoring of the antibodys effector function to match the desired therapeutic mechanism of action.

The EFECT platform is compatible with traditional monospecific antibodies and with Azymetric bispecific antibodies. We have licensed certain aspects of this therapeutic platform to Merck, GSK, Daiichi Sankyo and Janssen for use in conjunction with the Azymetric platform. We have also entered into a collaboration with GSK for the further development and commercialization of the EFECT platform. 
 We have designed the EFECT platform to provide the following competitive advantages: 
 

 | selective enhancement of activating FcgR interactions
--+------------------------------------------------------


 | enables precise up-regulation of immune effector function;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | selective enhancement of inhibitory FcgR interactions
--+------------------------------------------------------


 | enables precise downregulation of B cell or mast cell function and permits antibody crosslinking via immune cell engagement without immune cell activation; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | proprietary mutations to eliminate FcgR interactions
--+-----------------------------------------------------


 | eliminates the interaction between an antibody and the FcgR of immune cells more completely than alternative approaches while retaining the attractive pharmacokinetics of a full-sized antibody.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AlbuCORE Multispecific Antibody Alternative Platform 
 The AlbuCORE platform is a novel and proprietary suite of multivalent scaffolds based on HSA. This platform is highly flexible and enables the addition of up to four customizable targeting domains, which allows for additional tumor specificity and synergistic activity as well as increased affinity and selectivity for the desired target. The resulting superstructure naturally accumulates in tumor microenvironments or areas of inflammation and benefits from several attractive attributes of HSA, including superior pharmacokinetics and stability. Additionally, these AlbuCORE constructs possess standard manufacturing and purification protocols compatible with industry-standard conjugation technologies which accelerate development and reduce manufacturing costs. 
 We evaluated a number of positions where the native HSA amino acid sequence could be split into two polypeptide chains. When the two separate chains are co-expressed, they efficiently and spontaneously associate to reform a native-like HSA structure with four available termini to which antigen-targeting domains can be fused, or other agents chemically conjugated. 
 Variants created using the AlbuCORE platform retain the attractive features of HSA as a therapeutic scaffold. AlbuCORE variants exploit the natural accumulation of albumin in tumors through enhanced tumor permeability and retention, and the increased demand by tumors for albumin as a source of energy and amino acids. AlbuCORE variants also retain the favorable pharmacokinetic properties of HSA, which have previously been exploited by fusing HSA to peptides, hormones and cytokines to extend the half-life of these otherwise rapidly cleared molecules. Unlike antibodies, AlbuCORE-based biotherapeutics inherently lack effector function; this is a highly desirable trait in certain therapeutic applications. AlbuCORE variants also exhibit ideal manufacturing characteristics: they retain the stability and solubility characteristics exemplified by the frequent use of HSA as an excipient in pharmaceutical product formulations and can be produced in microbial expression systems at reduced cost-of-goods compared to other systems. 
 AlbuCOREs multivalent binding capabilities enable us to design biotherapeutics with high avidity binding or multispecific targeting to crosslink multiple disease targets and effector cells. Similar to the Azymetric platform, the AlbuCORE platform also offers the flexibility to test multiple formats with variable inter-termini distances and geometries. This allows us to identify a variant with the optimal targeting geometries needed to induce maximal effect for a particular disease state. 
 We have designed the AlbuCORE platform to provide the following competitive advantages:

ZymeCAD Computational Modeling and Engineering Technology 
 Our therapeutic platforms are enabled by our protein engineering expertise and by leveraging ZymeCAD, our proprietary computational modeling technology. We continue to leverage ZymeCAD to support our strategic partnerships and develop novel therapeutic platforms. 
 ZymeCAD is a comprehensive approach to predictive protein modeling and structure-guided protein engineering. We utilize this suite of proprietary software modules to develop better therapeutic platforms by increasing our understanding of the structure-function relationships and biophysical characteristics of specific protein changes. These software modules include: 
 Molecular Modeling 
 ZymeCAD includes a number of proprietary software tools used to build and refine the quality of high-definition molecular models, incorporating structural data from multiple sources including crystallography, homology and sequence data as well as experimentally derived data. High quality structural models of protein therapeutics and their interactions with targets are a critical component of our approach to protein engineering and the design of next-generation product candidates and therapeutic platforms. 
Conformational Dynamics 
 ZymeCAD incorporates a number of simulation approaches to sample and evaluate changes within molecular systems, including protein backbone, sidechain and interdomain changes. Proprietary simulation methodologies provide us with a comprehensive understanding of the alternate states and functional characteristics of the protein of interest, including target binding and stability. 
Hot Spot Determination 
 ZymeCAD plays a key role in the in silico identification of a specific subset of amino acids in a protein that is critical to determining its functional characteristic and overall stability. These amino acid residues can play a role either independently or as part of a cluster of networked residues, and through proprietary algorithms, ZymeCAD can identify these critical residues, referred to as hot spots. These analyses, including the inherent knowledge of the downstream impact of altering specific hot spots, can drive the rational design and engineering of product candidates. 
Energy Function and Scoring 
 ZymeCAD contains proprietary energy and scoring functions that score and rank the stability of proteins and binding energies across protein-target interfaces, and the outward-facing surfaces of the proteins. This empirical ranking methodology was developed, implemented and successfully utilized in the development of our platform technologies and biotherapeutics, and plays a key role in executing on our strategic partnerships relating to the development of new EFECT modalities. 
 
14 
 
Rigorous commercial software engineering practices, coupled with robust quality assurance standards and a world-class software engineering team have created an extensible, scalable, reliable and secure platform that we believe positions us to remain at the leading edge of the development of next-generation biotherapeutics as we continue to innovate beyond the current state of art in computational protein design. 
 Next-Generation Biologics Market Opportunity 
 The expansion of the pharmaceutical market driven by an aging worldwide population and increased standard of living in emerging markets has contributed to growth of the biologics markets over the last several years. Monoclonal antibodies are the most prevalent biologic type, as they are effective, amenable to platform development, well-validated as a therapeutic class and familiar to regulatory agencies. Since the first antibody approval in 1986, approximately 47 products have been approved by the FDA and international regulatory authorities. Notably, the three largest-selling oncology products are monoclonal antibodies, Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin, which had 2017 worldwide sales of approximately $7.7 billion, $7.2 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively. Currently there are over 300 monoclonal antibodies in various stages of clinical development with combined global sales expected to reach nearly $125 billion. 
 The overall market for bispecific antibodies has been estimated to reach $5.8 billion in 2024. Notably, these forecasts are conservative and reflect only projections for bispecifics in late-stage development. Challenges with existing bispecific technologies include a short half-life in vivo, low stability, and various manufacturing-related challenges. We believe the true market for bispecifics is significantly larger and we expect it to grow as clinical and regulatory experience with this class of therapeutics increases and stable bispecific antibodies with a longer in vivo half-life and enhanced efficacy are developed. 
 ADCs are a relatively more mature next-generation biotherapeutic technology comprising of monoclonal antibodies attached to biologically active drugs by chemical linkers with labile bonds. By combining the specific targeting ability of antibodies with cytotoxic drugs, ADCs allow sensitive discrimination between healthy and diseased tissue. Initial data suggests that some ADCs may have additive or synergistic effects with immuno-oncology drugs, notably with checkpoint inhibitors. Despite improvements in second generation ADCs, it is generally accepted that only a small fraction of their payload is delivered to the target, leaving significant room for improvement. Key challenges include production of consistent ADC batches, efficacy of antibody targeting and linkers with delayed payload release and poor stability. Potential solutions include alternative targeting mechanisms such as bispecifics, new linker technologies to improve the pharmacokinetic profile and improved conjugation of the linker to the antibody. Four ADCs are currently approved for use in the United States: Seattle Genetics Adcetris, Roche/Genentechs Kadcyla and Pfizers Besponsa and Mylotarg. Adcetris and Kadcyla accounted for $1.55 billion in sales for 2016. With over 50 antibody-drug conjugates in the clinic, including 20 programs in Phase 2 or Phase 3 trials, the market for ADCs has been estimated to be between $10.0 billion and $12.7 billion by the 2020-2025 timeframe. 
 Product Candidate Pipeline 
 ZW25: Anti-HER2 Biparatopic Antibody 
 Overview 
 ZW25, our lead product candidate currently being evaluated in an adaptive Phase 1 clinical trial in the United States, is based on our Azymetric platform. It is a bispecific antibody that can simultaneously bind two non-overlapping epitopes, known as biparatopic binding, of HER2 resulting in dual HER2 signal blockade, increased binding and removal of HER2 protein from the cell surface, and enhanced effector function. These combined mechanisms of action have led to activity in preclinical models of breast cancer, including trastuzumab-resistant (currently branded as Herceptin) high HER2-expressing tumors, as well as in tumors with lower levels of HER2 expression. Approximately 81% of patients with HER2-expressing breast cancer and 57% of patients with HER2-expressing gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer have tumors that express low to intermediate levels of HER2, making them ineligible for treatment with currently approved HER2-targeted therapies, such as Herceptin and Perjeta. In addition, multiple other cancers, including ovarian, bladder, colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer express HER2 at varying levels. Therefore, there is a significant unmet need for HER2-targeted agents that can effectively treat these patients. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, ZW25 has been well tolerated with promising single agent anti-tumor activity in patients with heavily pretreated HER2-expressing cancers that have progressed after standard of care treatment, including multiple HER2-targeted regimens. 
 
15 
 
We are developing ZW25 as a best-in-class HER2-targeting antibody intended as a treatment option for patients with any solid tumor that expresses HER2. Our initial focus is on the treatment of patients with high HER2-expressing breast or gastric cancers that have progressed after treatment with HER2-targeted therapies, such as Herceptin and Perjeta, or that are not eligible for approved HER2-targeted therapies based on lower levels of HER2 expression. We then intend to develop ZW25 as a therapeutic agent for other HER2-expressing cancers. ZW25 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of both gastric and ovarian cancer by the FDA. 
 HER2 and the Current Treatment of HER2-expressing Breast and Gastric Cancer 
 HER2 is a member of the human epidermal growth factor receptor, or HER, family of receptors that normally stimulate cell growth in response to ligand binding, receptor activation and downstream molecular signaling cascades. In cancerous cells, the gene encoding HER2 can become amplified. Amplification greatly increases the number of HER2 receptors expressed on the cell surface causing inappropriate and unregulated signaling that accelerates cell growth, reduces apoptosis and enhances cell motility leading to cancer. HER2 expression therefore provides a selective marker on the surface of tumors for therapeutic targeting. The table below illustrates the incidence of high HER2 expression in a variety of different cancer types: 
 Incidence of HER2 Gene and Protein Expression in Various Cancers 
 

Cancer Type | Incidence of High HER2Expression | 
Breast | | ~20 | %
Bladder | | 5-15 | %
Endometrial | | 8-35 | %
Ovarian | | 6.7 | %
Gastroesophageal | | 4-22 | %
Pancreatic | | 2-29 | %
Cervical | | 1-21 | %
Head & Neck | | 3 | %
Colorectal | | 2-3 | %
Lung | | 1-6 | %
Melanoma | | 0-5 | %

 Excerpted from Yan et al. HER2 aberrations in cancer: implications for therapy. Cancer Treatment Reviews 2014 40, 770-780.
The level of HER2 expression in tumors is commonly used to guide treatment decisions for patients with breast and gastric cancers. HER2 levels in tumor biopsies are typically screened by immunohistochemistry, or IHC, and assigned a value from 0 (baseline expression levels) to 3+ (extraordinarily high expression levels). Similarly, gene amplification can be determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, or FISH, and scored as either negative (two copies are normal) or positive (extra copies). The HER2 expression status of cancer can be described as High, Intermediate, Low or Negative according to the classification table below.

Breast and Gastric Cancer Classification According to HER2 Status 
 

HER2 expression has been associated with a worse outcome in a number of cancers, particularly HER2 High-expressing breast cancers. Prior to the advent of HER2-targeted therapies, patients with HER2-expressing breast cancer had reduced overall survival and greater likelihood of relapse relative to patients with HER2 Negative breast cancer. 
 Breast cancer treatment is based on disease stage, grade, hormone and HER2 receptor status. Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy and drug therapy. Early-stage tumors are typically removed by surgery and patients may be treated with drugs to prevent cancer recurrence, referred to as adjuvant therapy. In cases when the tumor is larger, patients may be administered drug treatments to reduce the tumor size prior to surgery, referred to as neoadjuvant treatment. Breast tumors that cannot be removed surgically because they are locally advanced or metastatic are treated primarily with drugs. 
 The type of drug prescribed for a particular breast cancer patient depends on the molecular signature of the patients tumor. HER2-targeted therapies are only approved for patients whose tumors are classified as HER2 High, representing approximately 20% of all breast cancer patients. Five drugs targeting HER2 have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of early and late-stage breast cancers that overexpress HER2: Herceptin (trastuzumab), Perjeta (pertuzumab), Kadcyla (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) or T-DM1, Tykerb (lapatinib) and Nerlynx (neratinib). Current standard of care for HER2 High breast cancer is built on a backbone of HER2 inhibition throughout all lines of therapy. For metastatic disease, first-line standard of care therapy consists of Herceptin, Perjeta and a taxane resulting in an average overall survival benefit of 56.5 months. Second line standard of care is Kadcyla. For patients who have progressed after treatment with Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla there is no preferred treatment. Options include Herceptin plus chemotherapy, Herceptin plus Tykerb or Tykerb plus Xeloda. While HER2-targeted therapies are effective in many patients with HER2 High breast cancer, some patients fail to respond to these drugs and all patients with metastatic disease ultimately relapse. 
 In addition to improved options for HER2 High breast cancer, there is also a need for HER2-targeted therapies that can effectively treat cancers with lower levels of HER2 expression (HER2 Low / HER2 Intermediate). Approximately 81% of patients with HER2-expressing breast cancer have tumors that express low to intermediate levels of HER2. Currently approved HER2-targeted therapies, such as Herceptin and Perjeta, are not sufficiently active to provide clinical benefit to patients whose tumors express low to intermediate levels of HER2 and therefore are not approved for these indications. Some of these patients may have tumors that express either or both the estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor and may receive hormone therapies such as tamoxifen, which can result in an average overall survival benefit of 43.3 months. However, tumors that lack expression of the estrogen and progesterone receptors and express HER2 at low to intermediate levels are currently classified as triple negative. These patients receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and fare much more poorly, living just 13.3 months, on average. We believe adding ZW25 to the existing standard of care for these molecular subtypes may lead to improved survival for these patients. 
 
17 
 
Breast Cancer Classification by Graded HER2 Expression 
 

A Significant Number of Breast Cancer Patients Express HER2 at Low and Intermediate Levels. ZW25 may be able to treat breast cancer patients whose tumors are currently classified as triple negative or hormone receptor positive that express HER2 at High, Intermediate and Low levels representing a substantial unmet medical need. 
 Many gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancers also have high levels of HER2 expression. Herceptin has been approved in combination with chemotherapy as first-line treatment of HER2 High-expressing gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers whereas other HER2-targeted agents including Kadcyla, Perjeta and Tykerb have failed to demonstrate efficacy in this indication. Patients with advanced gastric cancer whose tumors express high levels of HER2 and receive Herceptin plus chemotherapy live an average of 16 months and nearly all eventually progress. Beyond first-line Herceptin, there are currently no approved first-line HER2-targeted therapies for gastric cancer and the median progression-free survival for the preferred second-line regimen, Cyramza plus a taxane, is just 4.4 months, representing a significant unmet need. Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. For perspective, in the combined U.S., EU5, and major Asian markets of Japan (JP), China (CH) and South Korea (KR), the number of patients diagnosed with HER2 High gastric cancer (110,868) is comparable to HER2 High Breast Cancer (115,214). However, there are far fewer targeted therapies to treat gastric cancer, either approved or in clinical development, representing a significant opportunity for improvement. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, ZW25 has been well tolerated with promising single agent anti-tumor activity in patients with heavily pretreated HER2 High gastric cancers that have progressed after standard of care, including Herceptin. 
 
18 
 
Gastric Cancer Classification by Graded HER2 Expression 
 

HER2 High Gastric Cancer has Comparable Incidence to HER2 High Breast Cancer but with Greater Medical Need. HER2 High gastric cancer has comparable incidence in the combined US, EU5, and major Asian markets JP, CH and KR as HER2 High breast cancer with far fewer approved targeted therapies. ZW25 may be able treat gastric cancer patients whose tumors are currently classified as HER2 High as well as those with lower levels of HER2 expression. 
 A subset of other cancers, including ovarian, bladder, colorectal and NSCLC also express HER2 at varying levels and should be amenable to treatment with next-generation HER2-targeted therapies. Thus, there is a significant unmet need for biotherapeutics that can effectively treat HER2-expressing tumors not currently eligible for HER2-targeted therapies. 
 Potential Advantages of ZW25 
 ZW25 is an anti-HER2 biparatopic bispecific antibody. The biparatopic binding mode increases the number of antibodies bound to HER2 receptors at the cell surface relative to monospecific antibodies and promotes receptor clustering and internalization. 
 ZW25 mediates its therapeutic effect on HER2-expressing tumors through a combination of therapeutic mechanisms including: 
 

 | cross-linked trans HER2 binding and HER2 receptor clustering;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


 | enhanced antibody internalization and HER2 downregulation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | increased maximum binding density and potent effector function-mediated cytotoxicity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | enhanced blockade of ligand-dependent and ligand-independent tumor growth.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that ZW25 will be an effective therapy for the treatment of HER2-expressing breast cancer patients that are either ineligible for Herceptin or Perjeta based on HER2 expression levels, or who have relapsed or refractory HER2 High breast cancers. We estimate that the annual patient population for our lead indication (first-line Stage III inoperable and Stage IV breast cancer, HER2 2+, non-FISH amplified) in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom will reach 30,400 by 2023. 
 ZW25 may also be an effective therapy for the neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment of HER2 Low and Intermediate-expressing early-stage breast cancer. Given the large population that could potentially benefit from ZW25 treatment, approval in any of these indications would offer significant upside to the market opportunity for ZW25. 
 
19 
 
Clinical Development of ZW25 
 ZW25 is being evaluated in a non-randomized, open-label, adaptive Phase 1 clinical trial conducted pursuant to an IND submitted by us to the FDA that became effective in July 2016. This trial will evaluate ZW25 as a single agent (Part 1, 2) and in combination with standard of care chemotherapy (Part 3) in patients with locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumors that express HER2, as confirmed by IHC or FISH and as described in the IND for ZW25. The primary objectives of the trial are to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile and maximum tolerated dose of ZW25. Secondary objectives include evaluation of preliminary anti-tumor activity, as well as identification of potential biomarkers of response. We intentionally designed our Phase 1 trial to enable a potentially accelerated path to regulatory approval in patients who have progressed after approved therapies (Part 2), while maintaining the flexibility to include components (Part 3) which could help advance ZW25 into earlier lines of therapy. We have completed the dose escalation segment (Part 1) and enrollment is underway for Part 2 of the study utilizing ZW25 weekly at 10 mg/kg and every other week at 20 mg/kg in five expansion cohorts spanning HER2 High breast, HER2 High gastric, HER2 Intermediate breast, HER Intermediate gastric, and other HER2 gene amplified cancers. The full study is expected to be complete by the end of 2018. 
 A snapshot of the clinical database from November 16, 2017 for Part 1 of the Phase 1 clinical trial has demonstrated that ZW25 has been well tolerated with promising single agent anti-tumor activity in patients with heavily pre-treated HER2 expressing cancers, including multiple HER2 targeted regimens. A total of 22 patients were enrolled in the study, including 11 with breast cancer, eight with gastric, gastroesophageal junction, or esophageal (GE) cancer and three with other HER2 expressing cancers. The first part of this multi-part study was a standard dose escalation in which patients received ZW25 either weekly at 5 mg/kg (n=3), 10 mg/kg (n=6), or 15 mg/kg (n=7) or bi-weekly (once every two weeks) at 20 mg/kg (n=6) in four-week cycles to identify a dose and schedule to take forward for further evaluation. All patients had received multiple prior regimens of systemic therapy for metastatic disease (range 1-10), representing a heavily pretreated population. No dose-limiting toxicities were seen at any dose level or schedule. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, infusion reactions, or nausea, all Grade 1 or 2 in severity. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events, cardiac events or decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction. 
 In our study, seventy-nine percent of breast and GE cancer patients with measurable disease (11/14) had a decrease in target lesions per RECIST criteria. The best overall response (BOR) in 17 response-evaluable breast and GE cancer patients (defined as having target or non-target lesions and at least one tumor restaging) was six partial responses (PR) (35%), three stable disease (SD) (18%) and eight progressive disease (PD; 47%). Of the eleven breast cancer patients, all were HER2 high and had received a median of six prior HER2 targeted regimens for metastatic disease including trastuzumab (n=11), T-DM1 (n=11), pertuzumab (n=9), and lapatinib (n=7), as well as other investigational agents. The BOR in these heavily pretreated patients was five PR (45%), two SD (18%), and three PD (27%), for an overall disease control rate (Complete Response, PR, or SD) of 64%. At least one PR was observed in every dosing group. Of the eight GE patients, six were evaluable for response, and had received a median of four prior systemic regimens, including trastuzumab in all patients. Three of five patients with measurable disease had a decrease in tumor size, including one patient continuing on treatment with a confirmed PR and 71% decrease in target lesions, as well as a second patient with SD for over six months.

 If we continue to see evidence of anti-tumor activity in indications with high unmet medical need such as HER2-expressing cancer that has progressed after all therapies known to confer clinical benefit, we intend to seek fast track designation for ZW25 from the FDA. Furthermore, we would discuss with the FDA and other regulatory authorities the appropriate trial designs that might support accelerated approval using a surrogate endpoint such as response rate. We would also consider seeking breakthrough designation if the data were considered to be strongly compelling, such as evidence of a response rate or clinical benefit rate well above the expected rate. The FDA and corresponding regulatory authorities will ultimately review our clinical results and determine whether our product candidates are safe and effective and whether accelerated regulatory approval is possible. No regulatory agency has made any such determination that any of our product candidates are safe or effective for use by the general public for any indication nor has any regulatory authority provided any indication that ZW25 will be eligible for accelerated approval. 
 As ZW25 mediates its therapeutic effect through several mechanisms of action, we believe this antibody has the potential to be a best-in-class therapy providing clinical benefit to patients with any HER2-expressing cancer, including those with low to intermediate levels of HER2 that are not eligible for other HER2-targeted therapies, as well as those patients who have progressed after prior HER2-targeted therapies. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation to ZW25 for the treatment of both gastric and ovarian cancer.

ZW49: Anti-HER2 Biparatopic ADC 
 Overview 
 ZW49 is a biparatopic anti-HER2 ADC that is based on the same antibody framework as ZW25 and its predecessor product candidate, ZW33, and takes advantage of high levels of ZW25s antibody-targeted internalization to deliver our proprietary ZymeLink cytotoxic payload. ZW49 and ZW33 were being developed in parallel; however, we made the strategic decision to advance ZW49 as a lead product candidate in lieu of ZW33 based on ZW49s superior therapeutic window attributable to its use of our proprietary ZymeLink ADC platform. We are developing ZW49 as a best-in-class HER2-targeting ADC for several indications characterized by HER2 expression, especially for patients whose tumors have progressed or are refractory to HER2-targeted agents and those that express lower levels of HER2 and are ineligible for treatment with HER2-targeted therapies including Kadcyla. We plan on filing an IND application for ZW49 in 2018. 
Potential Advantages of ZW49 
 ZW49 is a combination of an Azymetric biparatopic anti-HER2 antibody conjugated to our proprietary ZymeLink cytotoxic payload via a cleavable linker. Our cytotoxic payload destabilizes tubulin, a protein necessary for cell division, and therefore selectively kills rapidly dividing cancer cells. Compared to existing HER2-targeted therapies, ZW49 mediates a superior therapeutic effect on HER2-expressing tumors through a combination of mechanisms, including: 

 | cross-linked trans HER2 binding and HER2 receptor clustering;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


 | increased HER2-mediated antibody internalization leading to:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


 | enhanced toxin-mediated cytotoxicity and tumor growth inhibition;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | enhanced HER2 downregulation;
--+------------------------------


 | increased maximum binding density and potent effector-function mediated cytotoxicity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | enhanced blockade of ligand-dependent and ligand-independent tumor growth.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The development of ZW49 will follow a similar path as we had proposed for ZW49s predecessor product candidate, ZW33. Initially, we plan to focus on patients with HER2 High-expressing breast and gastric cancer who have progressed on or are refractory to approved HER2-targeted agents, including Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla (or the combination therapy of Herceptin, Perjeta and chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer), as well as additional cancers expressing lower to intermediate levels of HER2. In preclinical studies, ZW49 has demonstrated superior activity compared to the only approved HER2-targeted ADC, Kadcyla. If ZW49 demonstrates superiority in head-to-head clinical trials, we believe it has the potential to replace Kadcyla as the preferred therapy for second line treatment of HER2+ metastatic cancer, for which the estimated annual patient population for this indication in the United States and EU is expected to reach 10,700 by 2023. Ultimately, ZW49 could be used as a follow-on therapy for ZW25, mirroring the development strategy employed for Kadcyla as follow-on therapy for Herceptin. ZW49 also has the potential to be a treatment for other HER2-expressing cancers, which would expand the addressable market. The FDA and corresponding regulatory authorities will ultimately review our clinical results and determine whether our product candidates are effective. No regulatory agency has made any such determination that ZW49 is effective for use by the general public for any indication. 
 Preclinical Development of ZW49 
 ZW49 displayed potent in vitro cytotoxicity in several cancer cell lines expressing HER2 and has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in multiple patient-derived xenograft models. In mice bearing HER2 High tumors, two doses of ZW49 at 3 mg/kg administered two weeks apart generated tumor regressions (Figure below left panel). For perspective, in the same xenograft model two doses of ZW33 at 3 mg/kg administered two weeks apart resulted in tumor growth inhibition (Figure below right panel). Furthermore, treatment with ZW49 resulted in anti-tumor activity in patient-derived xenograft models with lower levels of HER2 expression that do not respond to approved HER2-targeted therapies including T-DM1, or to ZW33.

ZW49 Demonstrates Tumor Regression in a HER2 HIGH PDX Model 
 

ZW49 Demonstrates Superior Anti-Tumor Activity Compared to ZW33 in a Trastuzumab-Resistant HER2 High Patient-Derived Xenograft Model. In two separate experiments using the same HER2 High PDX model, ZW49 (left panel) or ZW33 (right panel) were administered at 3 mg/kg on days 0 and 14 (indicated by the red arrows; n=7 (ZW49) or n=15 (ZW33) mice/group). 
 ZW49 was evaluated in a single-dose pharmacokinetic and tolerability study and a repeat-dose toxicology study in non-human primates. In the toxicology study, ZW49 was administered at 9 or 12 mg/kg every two weeks for five weeks. Based on the results of this study, the no observed adverse effect level, or NOAEL, of ZW49 was determined to be 12 mg/kg. For comparison, the NOAEL for ZW33 was determined to be 3 mg/kg when administered weekly for 38 weeks. The combination of improved anti-tumor activity and tolerability suggests that ZW49 has a wider therapeutic window relative to ZW33 and may address the unmet medical need in patients with low to intermediate HER2-expressing tumors. For these reasons, ZW49 is being advanced in lieu of our prior product candidate, ZW33. 
 Anticipated Clinical Development of ZW49 
 We plan to evaluate ZW49 as a monotherapy in a non-randomized, open-label Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with HER2 High breast and other HER2-expressing cancers, whose disease has progressed after all standard of care therapies. We intend to file an IND Application for ZW49 in 2018. 
 The primary objective of the planned Phase 1 clinical trial will be to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and maximum tolerated dose of ZW49. The secondary objectives for the trial will include evaluation of preliminary anti-tumor activity of ZW49, as well as an exploration of potential biomarkers of response. Based upon the observed safety and activity, subsequent development may focus on patients with HER2 High breast or HER2 High gastric cancer as well as early lines of therapy in patients whose tumors express lower levels of HER2 and are ineligible for treatment with HER2-targeted therapies, such as trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1.
Other Azymetric Product Candidates 
 We maintain ongoing discovery efforts to identify and test new target combinations, product candidates and platform technologies that have the potential to address unmet clinical needs. We have developed multiple undisclosed preclinical product candidates targeting a combination of known and novel tumor antigens based on our platform technologies. All of these candidates remain unpartnered. From this pool of discovery candidates, we plan to identify and advance multiple programs into clinical trials in the future.

Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations 
 Our Strategic Partnerships 
 Our unique combination of proprietary protein engineering capabilities and resulting therapeutic platform technologies was initially recognized by Merck and Lilly, with whom we established strategic partnerships focused on our Azymetric and EFECT therapeutic platforms. We subsequently entered into broader strategic partnerships with Celgene and GSK and a collaboration and cross-licensing agreement with Daiichi Sankyo. Following the completion of the initial agreements with Merck, Lilly and GSK, the relationships were subsequently expanded to include either additional licenses or therapeutic platforms. Most recently, we executed a licensing and collaboration agreement with Janssen to develop and commercialize next generation bispecific antibody therapeutics. These relationships provide our strategic partners with access to components of our proprietary Azymetric and EFECT therapeutic platforms for their development of a defined number of protein therapeutics, for which we will not have ownership. These strategic partnerships have provided us with non-dilutive funding as well as access to proprietary therapeutic assets, which increase our ability to rapidly advance our product candidates while maintaining worldwide commercial rights to our wholly owned therapeutic pipeline. To date, we have received over $75.8 million in the form of non-refundable upfront payments and milestone payments and are additionally eligible to receive up to $1.6 billion in preclinical and development milestone payments and $3.7 billion in commercial milestone payments available under our existing collaboration agreements, as well as tiered royalties on potential future product sales. It is possible, however, that our strategic partners programs do not advance as currently contemplated, which would negatively affect the amount of development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on potential future product sales we may receive. Importantly, these partnerships include predominantly non-target-exclusive licenses for any of our therapeutic platforms; thus we are free to develop therapeutics to many high-value targets utilizing our platforms. 
Merck 
 In August 2011, we entered into a research and license agreement with Merck, which was amended and restated in December 2014, to develop and commercialize three bispecific antibodies generated through the use of the Azymetric and EFECT platforms. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted Merck a worldwide, royalty-bearing antibody sequence pair exclusive license to research, develop and commercialize certain licensed products. We are eligible to receive up to $190.75 million, including an upfront payment ($1.25 million received in 2011), research milestone payments totaling $3.5 million ($2.0 million and $1.5 million received in 2012 and 2013, respectively), payments for completion of IND-enabling studies of up to $6.0 million, development milestone payments of up to $66.0 million and commercial milestone payments of up to $114.0 million. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties in the low to mid-single digits on product sales, with the royalty term being, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, either (i) for as long as there is Zymeworks patent coverage on products, or (ii) for five years, beginning from the first commercial sale, whichever period is longer. If there is no Zymeworks patent coverage on products, royalty rates will be reduced. 
 Under the agreement, we are sharing certain research and development responsibilities with Merck to generate bispecific antibodies with the Azymetric and EFECT platforms. Merck provides funding for a portion of our internal and external research costs in support of the collaboration. After the conclusion of the research program, Merck will be solely responsible for the further research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of the products. 
 The agreement contains customary termination rights for Merck and us including the right for Merck to terminate the agreement in its sole discretion with advance notice to us. The agreement will terminate on the later of: (a) the expiry of the last patent covering a Merck licensed product excluding methods of making the product; or (b) the expiry of the royalty payment obligations by Merck. During the research term, the agreement will terminate if the antibodies do not achieve all the research milestones or if Merck elects to not further develop the antibodies after the research term.

 Technology Licensing and In-Licensed Intellectual Property 
 We identify and selectively enter into technology licensing agreements and intellectual property in-licensing agreements to support pipeline advancement. Selected agreements include: 
 

 | CDRD Ventures Inc. (CVI; 2016): We entered into an assignment agreement with CVI, as part of our 2016 acquisition of Kairos Therapeutics Inc., or Kairos, to have all of CVIs interests in the Kairos patents and intellectual property assigned to Zymeworks. We may be required to make future payments to CVI for ZW49 or other product candidates upon the direct achievement of certain clinical development milestones for products incorporating certain Kairos intellectual property, as well as low-single digit royalty payments on the net sales of such products. For out-licensed products and technologies incorporating certain Kairos intellectual property, we may be required to pay CVI a mid-single digit percentage of the future revenue as a result of a revenue sharing agreement. We are not currently required to make any payments to CVI under this agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | Innovative Targeting Solutions Inc. (ITS; 2016): We entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with ITS which grants us the right to use ITS HuTARG discovery platform for the generation of therapeutic antibodies and other protein therapeutics. Pursuant to this agreement, ITS granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide, sub-licensable commercial license to its technology for the development of our internal therapeutic programs. This agreement requires us to make licensing payments to ITS of up to $12.0 million over the five years following August 2016.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Selexis (2015): We entered into a commercial agreement with Selexis under which we were granted rights to manufacture and commercialize product candidates, including ZW25 and ZW49, using a proprietary Selexis cell line. Licensing terms include an annual license maintenance fee, and clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones based on sales thresholds.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing 
 We rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations to provide manufacturing, linker-toxin conjugation, and fill-finish services in order to generate all of the therapeutic antibody supply required for our non-clinical and clinical studies. To retain focus on our expertise in developing new product candidates, we do not currently plan to develop or operate in-house manufacturing capacity. Our bispecific therapeutic antibody candidates require standard manufacturing and chemistry manufacturing and control, or CMC, processes typical of those required for monoclonal antibody manufacturing. We therefore expect to continue to be able to develop product candidates that can be manufactured in a cost-effective fashion by our network of well-validated third-party contract manufacturing organizations. 
 Through our contract manufacturing organizations, we currently have sufficient supply of our product candidates to carry out ongoing and planned preclinical studies. We also have sufficient cGMP-grade supply of ZW25, together with planned additional manufacturing runs, to complete our Phase 1 clinical trial. cGMP manufacturing of ZW49 is ongoing and anticipated to be completed on time to supply materials for GLP toxicology study and Phase 1 clinical trial. We plan to identify redundant suppliers and manufacturing, toxin conjugation, and fill-finish services for all development products candidates prior to submission to the FDA. 
 Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 With respect to target discovery activities, competitors and other third parties, including academic and clinical researchers, may be able to access rare families and identify targets before we do. 
 Many of the companies against which we compete or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaboration arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, recruiting patients for clinical trials, and by acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 
31 
 
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and price, the effectiveness of alternative products, the level of competition and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products or therapies that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. 
 Our product candidates will compete with the therapies and currently marketed drugs discussed below. 
 

 | ZW25: ZW25 is intended to treat patients with solid tumors that express HER2, including breast cancer patients with tumors expressing low to intermediate levels of HER2. Approved HER2-targeted therapies include Roches Herceptin, Perjeta, and Kadcyla as well as Novartis Tykerb and Puma Biotechnologys Nerlynx, although none of these drugs are effective in treating tumors expressing low to intermediate levels of HER2. Currently, these patients may receive hormone therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy including combinations of anthracyclines, taxanes, capecitabine and cyclophosphamide. We believe ZW25 will be a more effective and better tolerated therapy. There are other non-HER2 targeting monoclonal antibodies on the market that may have activity on tumors expressing low to intermediate levels of HER2 including Mercks Keytruda, Bristol-Myer Squibbs Opdivo, Roches Tecentriq, Merck KGaAs Bavencio and AstraZenecas Imfinzi; however, none of these agents are currently approved in breast or ovarian cancer, and only Keytruda is approved in gastric cancer (albeit as third-line salvage therapy in patients that are PD-L1 positive). Since antibodies blocking PD-1/PD-L1 are relatively well-tolerated and have a different mechanism of action than ZW25, if approved in these indications, we believe PD-1/PD-L1 blockade could potentially be used in combination with ZW25 to achieve even higher response rates.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ZW49: ZW49 is intended to treat patients with HER2-expressing breast cancer or other solid tumors that have progressed on, are refractory to, or are not eligible to receive existing HER2-targeted therapies. Roches Kadcyla as well as combinations of Herceptin, Tykerb and capecitabine are some of the currently approved treatments. We believe that ZW49 could potentially be a more effective therapy than Kadcyla based on our comparisons in preclinical models.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA and corresponding regulatory authorities will ultimately review our clinical results and determine whether our product candidates are effective. No regulatory agency has made any such determination that any of our product candidates are effective for use by the general public for any indication. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our ADC product candidates are comprised of both a drug product and a biologic product, and will therefore be subject to regulation in the United States as combination products. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and would require approval of independent marketing applications by the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to an FDA center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination products primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our ADCs, we believe that the primary mode of action is attributable to the biologic component of the product. We believe our other product candidates will be regulated as therapeutic biologics, with the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, having primary jurisdiction over premarket development. 
 
32 
 
Biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. 
 U.S. Biological Products Development Process 
 The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as preclinical, laboratory tests and preclinical animal trials and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practices, or GLPs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDAs regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological products identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsors control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDAs regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. 
 
33 
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labelling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other trials, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsors initial receipt of the information. 
 The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. 
 
34 
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal trials, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days after an End-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which Orphan Drug Designation has been granted. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the products identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product candidate. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. 
 
35 
 
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the applicant interprets the same data. If the FDA decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological products safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 The FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 In the United States, Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has Orphan Drug Designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product candidates but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product, as defined by the FDA, or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitors product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. 
 The FDA Reauthorization Act, which was enacted in August 2017, requires, among other things, that certain orphan drugs for cancer be tested for children. The government has also increased focus on the potential misuse of the orphan drug approval process to increase the price of orphan drugs. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. 
 
36 
 
 Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects and reporting updated safety and efficacy information. 
 We also must comply with the FDAs advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the products approved labelling (known as off-label use), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. 
 Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsors own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed interchangeable by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study. 
 
37 
 
The BPCIA is complex and only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA are subject to significant uncertainty. 
 Canadian Review and Approval Process 
 In Canada, our biologic product candidates and our research and development activities are primarily regulated by the Food and Drugs Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, which are enforced by Health Canada (including its Biologics and Genetic Therapies Directorate). Health Canada regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring, marketing and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Drug approval laws require licensing of manufacturing facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products, government review and approval of experimental results prior to giving approval to sell drug products including biologic drug products. Regulators also typically require that rigorous and specific standards such as Good Manufacturing Practices, Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, and Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, are followed in the manufacture, testing and clinical development, respectively, of any drug product. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in Canada, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 The principal steps required for drug approval in Canada is as follows: 
 Preclinical Toxicology Studies 
 Non-clinical studies are conducted in vitro and in animals to evaluate pharmacokinetics, metabolism and possible toxic effects to provide evidence of the safety of the drug candidate prior to its administration to humans in clinical studies and throughout development. Such studies are conducted in accordance with applicable laws and GLP. 
Initiation of Human Testing 
 In Canada, the process of conducting clinical trials with a new drug cannot begin until we have submitted a Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, and the required number of days has lapsed without objection from Health Canada. Biological drugs carry additional risks, as compared to traditional small molecule drugs, associated with complexity and variability in manufacturing that can contribute to increased lot-to-lot variation of the final product, and with the potential for adventitious agents. Therefore, the content requirements for the quality information for biological drugs to be used in clinical trials are different from those for standard small molecule pharmaceutical drugs (for example, the inclusion of information on manufacturing facilities is required for biological drugs). In addition, it is necessary to have more stringent controls on the release of biologic drug lots used in authorized clinical trials. 
 Similar regulations apply in Canada to a CTA as to an IND in the United States. Once approved, two key factors influencing the rate of progression of clinical trials are the rate at which patients can be enrolled to participate in the research program and whether effective treatments are currently available for the disease that the drug is intended to treat. Patient enrollment is largely dependent upon the incidence and severity of the disease, the treatments available and the potential side effects of the drug to be tested and any restrictions for enrollment that may be imposed by regulatory agencies. 
 Clinical Trials 
 Similar regulations apply in Canada regarding clinical trials as in the United States. In Canada, Research Ethics Boards, or REBs, instead of IRBs, are used to review and approve clinical trial plans. Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCP, requirements, which include review and approval by REBs. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated and a statistical analysis plan. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, as discussed above in the context of government regulation in the United States. 
 
38 
 
The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into Canada are also subject to regulation by Health Canada relating to their labeling and distribution. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to Health Canada and the applicable REBs, and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, in Canada, Health Canada or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an REB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the REBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects, potential trial subjects and the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate. 
 New Drug Application 
 Upon successful completion of Phase 3 clinical trials, in Canada the company sponsoring a new drug then assembles all the preclinical and clinical data and other testing relating to the products pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls, and submits it to Health Canada as part of a New Drug Submission, or NDS. The NDS is then reviewed by Health Canada for approval to market the drug. 
 As part of the approval process, Health Canada will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. Health Canada will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMPa quality system regulating manufacturingis satisfactory and the NDS contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. In addition, before approving an NDS, Health Canada will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. 
 The testing and approval process for an NDS requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and may take several years to complete. Biologic drugs, such as our candidates, differ from standard small molecule drugs in that applicants must include more detailed chemistry and manufacturing information. This is necessary to help ensure the purity and quality of the product, for example to help ensure that it is not contaminated by an undesired microorganism. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Health Canada may not grant approval of an NDS on a timely basis, or at all. In Canada, NDSs are subject to user fees and these fees are typically increased annually to reflect inflation. 
 Even if Health Canada approves a product candidate, the relevant authority may limit the approved indications for use of the product candidate, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a black box warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drugs safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms. 
 Biologic products in particular are monitored post-approval by being placed on a lot release schedule tailored to their potential risk, manufacturing, testing and inspection history to date. With higher risk biologics, each lot is tested before being released for sale in Canada. Moderate risk biologics are periodically tested at the discretion of Health Canada while manufacturers of low risk biologics usually only need to contact Health Canada regarding lots being sold or for providing certification of complete and satisfactory testing. Products are carefully scrutinized before they are placed in any level of the lot release process, and at any time the testing regime for a biologic may be altered. 
 
39 
 
Health Canada may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements, notification, and regulatory authority review and approval. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling or regulatory notification may be required. 
 Subsequent Entry Biologics and Exclusivity 
 The term subsequent entry biologic, or SEB, is used by Health Canada to describe a biologic drug that enters the market subsequent to a version previously authorized in Canada and with demonstrated similarity to a reference biologic drug. Accordingly, a SEB (known internationally as a biosimilar) will in all instances be a subsequent entrant onto the Canadian market. 
 Based on Health Canada guidance documents, a SEB can rely in part on prior information regarding safety and efficacy that is deemed relevant due to the demonstration of similarity to the reference biologic drug and which influences the amount and type of original data required. Generic drugs are chemically derived products that are pharmaceutically equivalent to innovative drugs, whereas SEBs are products of a biologic nature that are similar to innovative biologics. According to Health Canada, it is not currently possible to demonstrate that two biologic drugs are pharmaceutically equivalent, and therefore the regulatory approval process for generics and SEBs is different: SEBs are approved using the standard NDS pathway with some allowances made for reduced safety and efficacy information set out in guidance documents, while generic drugs are approved using an abbreviated new drug submission pathway set in guidance law. In part because it continues to be set out only in guidance and not law, the pathway for receiving SEB approval is somewhat in flux and subject to some uncertainty. 
 As discussed above, all SEBs enter the market subsequent to a biologic drug product previously approved in Canada and to which the SEB is considered similar. As such, SEBs are subject to existing laws and regulations outlined in the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations and the Food and Drug Regulations, and related guidance documents. 
 Similar to the Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States, Canada has the Patented Medicines (NOC) Regulations which require a company that files a drug submission that references a patented product to address any relevant patents listed on the Patent Register prior to being able to receive approval from Health Canada. The Canadian regime is similar to the United States regime, but a number of distinctions do exist. 
 Like the United States, Canada also has data protection, but again differences exist between the two jurisdictions. For example, Canadas data protection applies to innovative drugs (i.e., a drug that contains a medicinal ingredient not previously approved in a drug by the Minister of Health and that is not a variation of a previously approved medicinal ingredient such as a salt, ester, enantiomer, solvate or polymorph) and, where it exists, lasts for eight years in most (but not all) circumstances. In general biologics can be considered innovative drugs but SEBs are not. 
 Additional Regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, provincial, state and federal U.S. and Canadian laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
 
40 
 
Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, or EU, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each countrys national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a countrys requirements, clinical study development may proceed. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, coverage, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, managed care plans, private health insurers, and other organizations. These third-party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Third-party payors may attempt to control costs by limiting coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication, and by limiting the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are often used as models by private payors and other governmental payors to develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. However, one third-party payors decision to cover a particular drug product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. 
 The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products to obtain third-party payor coverage, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and to operate profitably. 
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost effective by third-party payors, that coverage or an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that third-party payors reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.

Healthcare Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our future products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
 In March 2010, the PPACA was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed, or will significantly change, the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following: 
 

 | an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price, or AMP, for branded drugs or the difference between AMP and best price, whichever is greater. For generic drugs the rebate is 13%;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | extension of manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | requirement that applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information regarding certain payments and other transfers of value given to physicians and teaching hospitals, and any ownership or investment interest physicians, or their immediate family members, have in their company;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


 | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | establishment of a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, including recent tax legislation that removed the financial penalties for people who do not carry health insurance. There is still uncertainty whether the PPACA will undergo additional revisions, and we cannot predict the impact of any future modifications, and it is uncertain how any such proposals, if approved, would affect these provisions. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations. Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. 
 We expect that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs, once regulatory approval is obtained. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with fraud and abuse laws such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as amended, the federal False Claims Act, as amended, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. The term remuneration is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the PPACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs in at least some cases, and do not contain safe harbors. 
 
43 
 
The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. There are many potential bases for liability under the federal False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, improper promotion of off-label uses (i.e., uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drugs label), and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our future activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the federal False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. Also, HIPAA created several additional federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
 In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and its implementing regulations established uniform federal standards for certain covered entities (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included expansion of HIPAAs privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAAs privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
 Under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which was enacted as part of the PPACA, certain drug manufacturers are required to track and annually report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. There are also an increasing number of state sunshine laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. These laws may affect our future sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. 
 
44 
 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. We may also be subject to additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement with a governmental entity to resolve allegations that we have violated these laws. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-approval requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 As an early-stage biopharmaceutical company, we do not currently possess the commercial infrastructure that will be required to launch and market our product candidates. To date, we have not entered into co-promotion or out-licensing agreements with established pharmaceutical companies for any of our product candidates. To access the sales, marketing and distribution capacity required to market our drug candidates, we plan to selectively establish partnerships with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies having established commercial capabilities in relevant indications. The timing and nature of such agreements will be determined by market size and complexity, access to pre-commercial and commercial infrastructure and our resource availability for developing a commercial organization. For product candidates targeting patient populations that can be serviced by a small, specialized commercial effort, we may seek out co-development and co-promotion agreements granting commercialization rights to an established commercial partner in some jurisdictions while allowing us to build these capabilities in other jurisdictions. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 147 employees, including 145 full-time employees, 95 of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities and 56 of whom hold an M.D. or Ph.D. degree. 125 of our full-time employees are based in Vancouver, British Columbia and 20 in Seattle, Washington. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or covered by a collective bargaining arrangement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be excellent. 
Corporate Structure 
 We were incorporated on September 8, 2003 under the Canada Business Corporations Act, or CBCA, under the name Zymeworks Inc. On October 22, 2003, we were registered as an extra-provincial company under the Company Act (British Columbia), the predecessor to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia), or BCBCA. On May 2, 2017, we continued the Company to British Columbia under the BCBCA. 
 The following reflects our organizational structure. We have one wholly owned subsidiary located in Seattle, Washington named Zymeworks Biopharmaceuticals Inc. Effective as of January 1, 2017, we completed a short-form amalgamation with our other previously wholly owned subsidiary domiciled in British Columbia, Zymeworks Biochemistry Inc.
