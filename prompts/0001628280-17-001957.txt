Overview
We incorporated in Delaware in February 2001, and our mission is to empower people and organizations to connect, communicate and collaborate in order to improve the way work gets done. We believe that our products drive top line revenue growth and cost savings by unleashing creativity, driving innovation and improving productivity through increased involvement and collaboration within the enterprise, and through engagement with employees, customers and partners.
We provide products that we believe improve business results by enabling a more productive and effective workforce through enhanced communications and collaboration both inside and outside the enterprise. Organizations deploy our products to improve the level of engagement, the quality of interaction and the overall relationship they have with their employees, customers and partners. Our traditional enterprise software product offerings, based on the Jive platform (the "Jive Platform"), are provided to customers as cloud-based, hosted or on-premise solutions. Our products are primarily offered on a subscription basis and can be used for internal or external communities. We generate revenues from product subscription license fees as well as from professional service fees for strategic consulting, configuration, implementation and training.
Our software has been recognized as a leading platform by industry analysts. In 2016, Jive was ranked as a leader in The Forrester Wave: Enterprise Collaboration, Q4 2016 report, which analyzed the state of the market for collaboration software and evaluated nine of the most significant vendors. 
2

We sell our products primarily through a direct sales force, both domestically and internationally. As of December 31, 2016, we had 981 customers.
2016 Highlights and Recent Developments
In February 2016, Jive delivered an updated release of its “interactive intranet” employee community product and its external community products, including a redesign of our product portfolio and new optimized processes to engage employees, customers and partners. 
Also, in February 2016, we introduced Jive WorkHub offerings representing packaged solutions focused on distinct verticals and lines of business including, the healthcare vertical, employee engagement and customer engagement. These out-of-the-box packages were developed to provide an easy way for customers to quickly adopt solutions built to meet their specific needs.
In May 2016, the Company introduced the 2016 Realignment Plan intended to create a path to profitability for the Company and to re-balance staffing levels to better align them with the evolving needs of our business. 
In October 2016, Jive entered into a lease with Water Tower Fee Owner, LLC for approximately 12,500 square feet of office space in Campbell, California with occupancy beginning in March 2017. In October, the Company separately entered into an amendment to its office lease with TTC Partners, LLC for the Company’s existing corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, California that provides for an early termination of such lease in March 2017. 
In November 2016, Jive made the strategic decision to transition its cloud infrastructure to Amazon Web Services. The transition of our cloud infrastructure is intended to be completed by the end of 2017 and is anticipated to drive greater customer value by accelerating delivery of new cloud functionality. 
In December 2016, Jive received sponsorship from an existing customer for the Federal Risk and Authorization Program, or FedRAMP, “in process” certification program.
Jive Platform Offerings
As we have described above, we deliver products that allow companies to connect, communicate and collaborate more effectively with employees, customers and partners. Our products provide the innovation, creativity and ease of use found in consumer applications combined with the security, flexibility and scalability necessary for enterprise deployment. The Jive Platform product offerings are delivered in two key configurations, Jive Internal (Jive-n) for employee networks, and Jive External (Jive-x) as a platform for customer and partner communities. These products can be expanded by adding optional modules, as well as connectors and integrations into existing enterprise systems and applications. Our Jive Platform products can also be extended to integrate cloud and customer-built applications through published application programming interfaces (“APIs”) and software development kits ("SDKs").

We offer our customers the ability to configure our solutions to deliver the specific functionality and user experience they want for their end-users along with the ability to modify the look and feel of our solutions to conform to their branding or other requirements.

Recommendations
The Jive recommendation engine is an innovative user interface that makes it easy to track, consume, manage and filter critical business information, communications and actions. A key component is a highly tuned enterprise activity stream that enables users to rapidly access, discover and interact with conversations, content and decisions. Our noise filtering capability addresses the challenges of information overload, helping users focus on mission critical and timely information. Additionally, the recommendation engine draws on real-time intelligence derived from the enterprise work graph to predict and recommend content, people and groups to users, based upon employee roles, positions and previous communications.

Integration and Extension
The Jive Platform is a communication and collaboration hub, bringing together information and conversations from many different systems. In addition to the many integrations included with the Jive Platform, Jive provides extensive capabilities for integrating our platform with other systems. Jive provides rich developer APIs and tools that enable bi-directional exchange of content, conversation, streams and data between Jive and other systems. Many third-party developers have created commercial integrations that are available in the Jive Add-ons directory. Further, the APIs and developer tools are available for in-house IT teams to integrate and extend our platform based on company-specific requirements.
Jive Anywhere
Jive Anywhere enables users to import any content from a web browser into the Jive Platform. This feature automatically connects conversation, content and context within a user’s Jive network with any website or web application. Jive Anywhere helps users avoid complicated point-to-point integrations between their collaborative platform and other enterprise systems and websites by making it easy to discuss and share content with one click.
Product Modules and Advanced Features
Jive offers additional functionality in modules and advanced features built to integrate with the Jive Platform products.
Enterprise Integrations. Jive provides several pre-built integrations with common content management applications, communication systems and systems of record, including the following:

Gamification makes it easier to create custom missions and competitions to kickstart user participation and drive user behavior, such as encouraging sales reps to complete training or customer service agents to answer customer questions in a timely fashion.
Analytics. Jive Analytics provides detailed, easy-to-read metrics and reports for community managers, business leaders and individual users.
External Groups. Users can collaborate with their entire extended team, including those outside the firewall. Security and permissions controls let users specify who sees what, without exposing confidential information to people outside the company or outside the relationship.
Encryption at Rest. Jive Encryption at Rest provides a hardware-based security solution that’s non-disruptive, comprehensive and easy to use. The single-source solution increases overall compliance with industry and government regulations without compromising storage efficiency.

Enhanced Disaster Recovery. In the event of an extended interruption in hosting services, Jive makes every reasonable effort to restore customers’ instances as soon as possible. For customers with more stringent compliance requirements or for whom Jive is simply mission critical, we offer Enhanced Disaster Recovery services that include documented plans, recovery point and time objectives, as well as specific service level agreements (SLAs) if needed. 
Ideation. Our Ideation module involves employees, customers and partners in the process of capturing, refining and prioritizing innovative ideas. Once an idea is submitted, users can vote it up or down, and discuss ways to improve the idea. Those managing the ideation process can categorize ideas to keep participants informed of progress.
Jive Resonata. For our Jive-x Platform, Jive Resonata analyzes the activity in a Jive-x customer community and reveals the sentiments, behaviors and motivations that drive participation and satisfaction. It identifies a community’s champions and detractors, tracks trends and spots emerging problems.

Professional Services and Customer Support
Our professional services team provides a range of offerings including strategy consulting, project management, technical expertise, and education and training. Our team can lead the design, implementation and launch of the Jive Platform and seeks to ensure that our solution meets the design and implementation parameters established by our customers with clear, measurable business benefits. We also provide post-launch support and on-going assistance to encourage and facilitate adoption within the enterprise.
We offer training services to our customers and partners. We offer training either in-person or over the web and online educational classes. We also provide a variety of training videos and quick start guides that are available online. Our education offerings are targeted at training partners, users, community managers and system administrators.
Our global customer support organization provides both proactive and customer-initiated support. Assistance is available by email, telephone and through our online Jive community, called JiveWorks, built on our social business platform. Customers can track the status and relevant information relating to their queries in real-time and have access to a wide range of information sharing utilities that facilitate access to both internal and external community feedback.
Our support team is staffed with experienced support specialists and engineers who have experience with the software systems with which our products integrate. We engage in regular training and certification processes as new products and technologies are introduced.
Our basic deployment includes “Silver Level” support. Our customers may contract for increased levels of support (“Gold Level” or “Platinum Level”), which provide for higher required service levels for reduced response times, as well as additional support services.
Technology and Operations
Our product portfolio brings the Jive experience to a broad set of platforms and applications and is designed to bring powerful communication capabilities and valuable context to users, regardless of where or how they are working. Our platform can be accessed from mobile phones, tablets and desktop computers; as a browser, Microsoft Office or SharePoint plugin; and through a rich set of REST, JavaScript and Objective C APIs. System integrators, third-party vendors and customers leverage our APIs to extend, customize and integrate with our platform.

Our core application is written primarily in Java and is designed to run on both public and private cloud deployments. It runs on the Linux operating system and is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL. In our public cloud, we are developing and porting an increasing portion of our features to multi-tenant architectures. Through connectivity to our cloud, private cloud deployments can also access such functionality, which includes activity streams and mobile. The Jive Platform integrates with existing enterprise systems and can be extended with new functionality through the utilization of a broad set of APIs. These APIs facilitate the building of custom integrations to our platform.
In our cloud, hosted and on-premise offerings, our customers can customize our platform to meet their enterprise requirements for branding and security, through customer-specific domain names, SSL encryption and other mechanisms.
We host our cloud and hosted communities for hundreds of our customers and millions of end-users. We work with large data center vendors to provide the international foundation of our social business platform. Our enterprise-class hardware platforms provide high levels of performance, flexibility and security. We currently utilize multiple data center facilities located in North America and Europe. Each facility utilizes multiple network providers, as well as services to help ensure security, reliability, redundancy and performance. We maintain and operate additional facilities in geographically diverse locations for offsite backup storage and disaster recovery.
We recently made the decision to transition our cloud offering infrastructure to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and expect to substantially complete the transition of our cloud customers to AWS by the end of 2017. Data for customers with cloud offerings will be hosted either in AWS data centers in United States or in Europe.
Our architecture and security teams are based in our Palo Alto, California office, which will be moving to our new Campbell, California facility in the first quarter of 2017, and in Portland, Oregon, with our network operations center and deployment teams based in Portland, Oregon and the United Kingdom.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our platform primarily through our global direct sales organization. Our direct sales team is comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel who are organized by prospect company size and geographic regions, including the North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. We also work with channel partners, including resellers, implementation partners, leading global outsourcing vendors and system integrators domestically and internationally. As of December 31, 2016, we had 156 employees in sales and marketing and we had more than 60 Jive Alliance Partners, which create referrals and resell our platform worldwide.
We generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs. Our marketing programs target company executives both inside and outside of information technology organizations, senior business leaders and other technology professionals. Our principal marketing programs include:

• | use of our website to provide product and company information, as well as learning opportunities for potential customers;


• | regional field marketing events for customers and prospects;


• | in house and contracted sales development teams who prospect for new leads and respond to incoming leads to convert them into new sales opportunities;

• | sponsorships and participation in marketing programs in the broader Jive ecosystem.

In addition, we host a periodic user conference, called JiveWorld, where current and potential customers participate in a variety of programs designed to help drive business results through the use of our platform. This conference features a variety of prominent keynote and customer speakers, panelists and presentations focused on businesses of all sizes, across a wide range of industries and lines of business. Attendees also gain insight into our recent product releases and enhancements and participate in interactive sessions that give them the opportunity to express opinions on new features and functionality.

Customers
We generally sell our platform and related services through our global sales organization directly to businesses, government agencies and other enterprises. As of December 31, 2016, we had 981 Jive Platform customers in diverse industries, including consulting services, education, financial services, healthcare, life sciences, manufacturing, retail, telecommunications and technology. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our total revenues in 2016, 2015 or 2014.
The following table sets forth a representative list of a selection of our largest customers by industry category:

Financial Services | Healthcare | Retail 
The Bank of New York Mellon | Aetna | Adeo Services 
Credit Suisse | Humana | GAP 
Fidelity | Spectrum Health | lululemon athletica 
Liberty Mutual | Swedish Partners Medical Group | NBC Universal Media 
Societe Generale | United Health Group | Starwood Hotels and Resorts
Technology | Telecommunications | 
Adobe | Alcatel-Lucent | 
Cisco | Motorola Solutions | 
EMC Corporation | Sprint | 
Hitachi Data Systems | T-Mobile | 
McAfee | Verizon | 

Research and Development
We base a meaningful amount of our product development on the needs of our customers. We work closely with our user community to continually improve and enhance our platform through organic development and the acquisition of new products and features. We emphasize collaboration with customers throughout all areas of our organization in the development process. Our online Jive community, known as JiveWorks, is a collaborative workspace for customers to suggest and comment on new features and functionality. This input is utilized in many of our development plans and provides valuable customer insight that we use to establish the priorities of our engineering team. We also incorporate feedback from our employees, all of whom use our products and test alpha versions before each major release.
We also focus our research and development efforts on rapidly delivering new products and upgrades of our existing products to our customers. We leverage open source technology wherever appropriate and contribute many of the improvements we make back to the open source community. We maintain healthy code and adhere to sound engineering practices to ensure a fast pace of development. We have teams dedicated to developing and testing innovative new products and users' experiences, advancing our core architecture and improving the speed and completeness of our automated continuous integration pipeline.
As of December 31, 2016, we had 173 employees in research and development.
Competition
The overall market for social business platform solutions is rapidly evolving, highly competitive, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We currently compete with large, well-established multi-solution enterprise software vendors, such as Microsoft, IBM and salesforce.com, inc., enterprise software application providers which are adding social features to their existing applications and platforms, such as Facebook, and smaller specialized software vendors. Facebook recently launched Workplace by Facebook to provide an enterprise version of its social network service. Additionally, in December 2016, Microsoft Corporation acquired LinkedIn, Inc., in an effort to combine Microsoft's existing products and services with LinkedIn's professional networking capabilities. In January 2017, Slack introduced Slack Enterprise Grid, a new version of its collaboration application designed specifically for large-scale enterprises. Our primary competition for internal communities currently comes from established enterprise software companies that have greater name recognition, larger customer bases, much longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we have and are able to provide comprehensive business solutions that are broader in scope than the solution we offer. Additionally, we compete with smaller companies who may be able to adapt better to changing conditions in the market.
8

We expect that the competitive landscape will change as the market for social business platforms consolidates and matures.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:

• | total cost of ownership;


• | breadth and depth of product functionality;


• | brand awareness and reputation;


• | ease of deployment and use of solutions;


• | level of customization, configurability, security, scalability and reliability of solutions;


• | ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;


• | perceived return on investment through the use of social technologies;


• | size of customer base and level of user adoption; and


• | ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications.

We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. Notwithstanding the fact that some of our competitors offer the basic versions of their products for free or as low-cost additions to other software suites, we have demonstrated that customers are willing to pay for the business value that our platform delivers. Our ability to remain competitive will depend, to a great extent, upon our ongoing performance in the areas of product development and customer support.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, contractors and consultants, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We also rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, trade dress and domain name reservations to protect our intellectual property. We have continued to seek patent protections for our technology and processes. We pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. As of December 31, 2016, we had nine patent applications pending and 10 patents registered.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which our products and solutions are distributed. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming and the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete and harm our operating results.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 595 regular full-time employees, including 44 in hosting, 73 in support, 56 in professional services, 173 in research and development, 156 in sales and marketing and 93 in general and administrative roles. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Segments
We sell a single platform, have one business activity and there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results or plans for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, we have determined that we operate in a single reporting segment, software sales and services.
