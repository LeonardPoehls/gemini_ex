ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Introduction
 
We are a blank check company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 29, 2015. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
 
On June 28, 2017, we entered into an Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with JH Capital Group Holdings, LLC (“JH Capital”), Jacobsen Credit Holdings, LLC, NJK Holding LLC, Kravetz Capital Funding LLC to effect a business combination with JH Capital (the “JH Capital Business Combination”), a leading specialty finance company in the debt recovery industry. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Investment Agreement, at the closing (the “Closing”) of the JH Capital Business Combination, we will contribute cash to JH Capital in exchange for newly issued voting Class A Units of JH Capital. We will receive a number of Class A Units of JH Capital equal to the number of shares of our common stock outstanding at the Closing, after giving effect to the redemption of shares of common stock pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. At the Closing, we will file an amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which will, among other things, reclassify all of our outstanding common stock as Class A common stock, create a new class of our Class B common stock and change our name to “JH Capital Group Holdings, Inc.”
 
Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement is subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including the approval of the JH Capital Business Combination by our stockholders in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the completion of a redemption offer whereby we will be providing our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit in the trust account.
 
The Investment Agreement and related agreements are further described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by us on June 30, 2017, and the amendments to the Investment Agreement are described in the Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by us on November 9, 2017 and February 15, 2018. For additional information regarding JH Capital, the Investment Agreement and the JH Capital Business Combination, see the Preliminary Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed by the Company on February 14, 2018.
 
Other than as specifically discussed, this report does not assume the closing of the JH Capital Business Combination.
 
Our management team is led by Darrell Crate, Chairman of the Board, and Avshalom Kalichstein, Chief Executive Officer. Messrs. Crate and Kalichstein have an average of more than 24 years of financial services industry experience, and Mr. Crate brings to our team extensive capital markets and listed company experience, having served as chief financial officer of Affiliated Managers Group, Inc., a NYSE listed company, for 13 years.

On May 4, 2015, our sponsor purchased 4,312,500 founder shares, for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 or approximately $0.006 per share. On July 3, 2015, our sponsor transferred 20,000 founder shares to each of our independent directors at their original purchase price. On July 29, 2015, we effected a stock dividend of 0.2 shares for each outstanding share of common stock, resulting in our sponsor and officers and directors holding an aggregate of 5,175,000 founder shares. Up to 675,000 founder shares were subject to forfeiture by our initial stockholders (or their permitted transferees) depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option was exercised.
 
Our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-203975) was declared effective on July 29, 2015 and on August 4, 2015 we consummated our IPO of 20,000,000 of our units, including 2,000,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ partial exercise of their over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one share of our common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share of common stock. The public units were sold at a price of $10.00 per share, generating gross proceeds to us of $200,000,000. As a result of the expiration of the underwriters’ option to exercise the remaining portion of the over-allotment, our sponsor forfeited an aggregate of 175,000 founder shares. The sponsor, our independent directors and their permitted transferees, owned 20% of our issued and outstanding shares which was increased to approximately 25% (as discussed below).
 
On August 4, 2015, simultaneously with the consummation of our IPO, we consummated the private sale of 6,750,000 private placement warrants at a purchase price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds to us of $6,750,000. The private placement warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the public units in our IPO, except that so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) they will not be redeemable by us, (ii) they (including the common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination and (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis.
 
A total of $200,000,000 of the proceeds from our IPO and the private placement warrants were placed in a trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. These funds will not be released until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, although we may withdraw the interest earned on the funds held in our trust account to pay franchise and income taxes.
 
On September 17, 2015, we announced that the holders of our units may elect to separately trade the common stock and warrants included in the units commencing on or about September 21, 2015 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “EACQ” and “EACQW”, respectively. Those units not separated will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “EACQU.”
 
On March 17, 2016, we issued a convertible promissory note to our sponsor that provides for our sponsor to loan us up to $1,000,000 for ongoing expenses. On March 17, 2016, February 2, 2017, June 29, 2017, July 12, 2017, October 1, 2017 and December 4, 2017, we borrowed $15,000, $250,000, $75,000, $150,000, $30,000 and $75,000, respectively, pursuant to the convertible promissory note. Our sponsor is not obligated to loan us additional amounts pursuant to the convertible promissory note. The convertible promissory note is interest bearing at 5% per annum and is due and payable on March 31, 2018, which date will be extended if our stockholders approve an extension of the deadline by which we have to complete our initial business combination from March 31, 2018 to June 30, 2018 at the special meeting of our stockholders that will be held on March 29, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, the interest accrued is $19,371. At the option of our sponsor, any amounts outstanding under the convertible note may be converted into warrants to purchase shares of common stock at any time on or prior to the maturity date at a conversion price of $1.00 per warrant. Each warrant will entitle our sponsor to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. Each warrant will contain other terms identical to the terms contained in the private placement warrants.
 
On August 1, 2017, we held our annual meeting of stockholders and 23,415,152 of the outstanding 25,000,000 shares were voted in favor of the proposal to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which we had to consummate a business combination until December 15, 2017, to change the term of our directors from two years to one year, and to change the provision with respect to removal of directors to permit removal with or without cause by the affirmative vote of a majority of our stockholders and the proposal to amend the agreement with respect to the trust account to provide for the extension until December 15, 2017. In addition, our board of directors was reelected. The holders of 4,289,791 public shares of our common stock properly exercised their right to convert their shares into cash at a conversion price of approximately $10.02 per share.
 
On December 14, 2017, we held a special meeting of stockholders and 19,325,891 of the outstanding 20,710,209 shares were voted in favor of the proposal to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which we had to consummate a business combination until March 31, 2018, and the proposal to amend the agreement with respect to the trust account to provide for the extension until March 31, 2018. The holders of 687,597 public shares of our common stock properly exercised their right to convert their shares into cash at a conversion price of approximately $10.06 per share. In connection with the approval of this extension, JH Capital agreed to contribute to us as a loan of $0.03 for each public share that was not redeemed in connection with the December 14, 2017 special meeting, for each calendar month or portion thereof that is needed by Easterly to complete a business combination from December 15, 2017 until March 31, 2018, which amounts will be added to the trust account (the “Contributions”). On January 15, 2018 and February 15, 2018, we deposited the first and second Contributions into the trust account.
 
On December 28, 2017, we issued 888,000 warrants (the “Fortress Warrants”) to Fortress Credit Corp. (“Fortress”) in connection with a loan provided by Fortress to JHPDE Finance I, LLC, a subsidiary of JH Capital (the “Fortress Loan”). If the JH Capital Business Combination closes, the Fortress Warrants will each be exercisable to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at $11.50 per share, have a term of 5 years from the date of the closing of the JH Capital Business Combination and may only be exercisable as follows: 444,000 shares will be immediately exercisable, and the remaining 444,000 shares will become exercisable ratably with the funding of the first $100,000,000 under the Fortress Loan (e.g., 111,000 shares will become exercisable on the date on which the first $25,000,000 has been funded under the Fortress Loan). However, the Fortress Warrants may be exercised only on or after the date which is 30 days after the first date on which Easterly and JH Capital complete the JH Capital Business Combination.
 
On December 28, 2017, we entered into a Letter Agreement (the “December 28 Letter Agreement”) with JH Capital, Jacobsen Credit Holdings, LLC (“Jacobsen Holdings”), Kravetz Capital Funding LLC (“KCF” and, together with Jacobsen Holdings, the “Principal Members”) and NJK Holding LLC (“NJK Holding” and, together with KCF and Jacobsen Holdings, the “Founding Members”). Pursuant to the December 28 Letter Agreement, Jacobsen Holdings issued us a warrant, dated December 28, 2017 (the “Founding Member Warrants”), to acquire from Jacobsen Holdings 888,000 shares of our Class A common stock or Class B Units of JH Capital. The Founding Member Warrants will be exercisable at a price of $11.50 per share of our Class A common stock or Class B Unit of JH Capital, have a term of 5 years from the date of the closing of the JH Capital Business Combination and may be exercised only to the extent that the Fortress Warrant has been exercised. The Founding Member Warrants will first be exercisable for an amount of our Class A common stock equal to the number of shares of our Class A common stock acquired by Jacobsen Holdings and NJK Holding from the Sponsor pursuant to the Letter Agreement and thereafter for Class B Units of JH Capital owned by them.
 
On March 8, 2018, we filed a definitive proxy statement to hold a special meeting of our stockholders on March 29, 2018 for the purposes of extending the date by which we have to consummate a business combination from March 31, 2018 to June 30, 2018. If the extension is approved at this special meeting, JH Capital has agreed to continue to contribute to us as a loan of $0.03 for each public share that is not redeemed in connection with the special meeting, for each calendar month or portion thereof that is needed by us to complete a business combination from March 31, 2018 to June 30, 2018.

Business Strategy
 
We intend to employ a proactive acquisition strategy that will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region. We intend, however, to focus on companies operating in the financial services industry that exhibit some or all of the following characteristics, which we believe to be important in evaluating prospective targets for our initial business combination:

· | barriers to competitive entry; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------
· | a sustainable competitive advantage; 
· | a motivated and capable management team; and 
· | an attractive ability to grow cash flow or book value, as applicable.

 
Given the industry background and experience of our management team, we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on certain trends that are influencing strategic direction within the broader financial services sector. We believe that such trends have generated, and will continue to generate, an attractive environment for evaluating target businesses, including the following characteristics:
 

· | Long-term global demographic and macroeconomic trends, which will influence the direction of the retirement, asset management and insurance sectors. The number of U.S. persons over 65 years old as of the year 2015 is projected by the U.S. Census Bureau to double by the year 2060, and U.S. retirement assets have grown by a compound annual growth rate of 9.6% between the years 2009 to 2014. Aging populations, increased longevity and a decline in traditional employer-sponsored defined benefit pension schemes are placing enhanced emphasis on the private market to provide retirement and protection solutions to developed market populations. As of the year 2015, financial services represents 20% of U.S. GDP according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Federal Reserve estimates the total size of non-bank U.S. finance is $15 trillion, indicating the existence of a substantial market in non-bank financial services. In emerging markets, the preceding trends are further magnified by the substantial increase in wealth of large segments of the population, which is driving new demand for banking, insurance and wealth management products. We believe these demographic and macroeconomic factors create substantial opportunities for acquisition in a variety of industries and geographies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Convergence of technological solutions with financial products, distribution and user access. In the coming years and decades, technology will continue broadly to transform the nature of the financial services industry. This transformation impacts the types of products demanded by consumers, the ways in which customers acquire new products and the ways in which customers interact with current products. Recent examples include new electronic payment technologies. We believe that worldwide mobile payment usage has grown significantly since 2011. Other technology related trends include the increased outsourcing of non-core business functions, enhanced use of customer data, and the use of algorithm guided investing and mobile technology. We believe that financial services business models are primed for disruption by such technological advances, which should lead to substantial opportunities to acquire businesses that will benefit significantly from our management team’s deep industry experience.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ongoing global regulatory regime changes and reforms create a changing landscape for current market participants. Following the global financial crisis, enhanced scrutiny and regulation of banks and insurance providers have prompted financial services companies to review business portfolios and realign strategic direction, creating an opportunity for non-regulated firms to play a bigger role in the lending and lending-related services, insurance, finance, and financial technology industries. We believe that these structural changes to markets will continue to provide opportunities to acquire non-core businesses and to fill niches created as traditional market participants shift their focus.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We intend to target for acquisition businesses in which a combination of our relationships, experience and capital can be the catalyst to transform the business and accelerate its growth. Our universe of potential acquisition targets in the financial services industry includes, but is not limited to the following:

-


· | Insurance-related companies including: underwriters; brokerages; and insurance services providers including claims and loss adjustment firms; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Investment-related companies including: asset managers; brokerage and trading firms; and investment consultants; 
· | Diversified financial services companies including: banks; residential and commercial mortgage banking and servicing firms; and non-bank finance companies; and
· | Financial technology and services-related companies including: payments and processing firms and financial information providers 

 
Our acquisition selection process will leverage our team’s network of financial services industry, private equity sponsor and lending community relationships as well as relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment bankers, restructuring advisers, attorneys and accountants that we believe will provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. In addition, we intend to utilize the networks and industry experience of Messrs. Crate and Kalichstein and Easterly LLC in seeking a business combination. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and others at Easterly LLC have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships, primarily through the following means:
 

· | Experience in sourcing, acquiring, developing, growing, financing and selling financial services businesses; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Relationships with sellers, capital providers and management teams of target financial services businesses; and
· | Experience executing transactions through various market cycles and global financial market conditions. 

 
We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team provides us with an important source of acquisition opportunities. In addition, target business candidates may be also brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises.
 
Our sponsor provides support and advice to our management team in such areas as product development, marketing, client service, recruiting and operations, as well as in the pursuit of external growth through accretive, strategic acquisitions.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with this strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses in the financial services sector. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following criteria:

· | Financial condition and results of operation; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Growth potential; 
· | Brand recognition and potential; 
· | Experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;
· | Capital requirements; 
· | Competitive position; 
· | Barriers to entry; 
· | Stage of development of the products, processes or services; 
· | Existing distribution and potential for expansion;

-


· | Potential for additional add-on acquisitions; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services; 
· | Proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas; 
· | Impact of regulation on the business; 
· | Regulatory environment of the industry; 
· | Costs associated with effecting the business combination; 
· | Industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and
· | Competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes. 

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria deemed relevant by our management in effecting an initial business combination consistent with our business objective.
 
Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough and extensive due diligence review, which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews and inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that is made available to us.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event that we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or an accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
Members of our management team directly or indirectly own our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Each of our officers and directors do not currently, but may, in the future, have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity.
 
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination by March 31, 2018 (or June 30, 2018 if approved by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders). None of our officers or directors, other than Mr. Hauslein, has been involved with any blank check companies or special purpose acquisition corporations in the past.

Initial Business Combination
 
If we are able to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq, the Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We intend to fulfill the requirements of this Nasdaq rule even if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq at the relevant time. If our board is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination.
 
While we anticipated structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, we may, however as in the case of the JH Capital transaction, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.
 
Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets
 
We believe our management team’s significant operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring, financing and selling businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.
 
We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with important sources of proprietary acquisition opportunities or other opportunities in which a limited group of investors are invited to participate in the sale process. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.

If any of our executive officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our executive officers and directors do not currently, but may, in the future, have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.
 
Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
 
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively. Additionally, the risk of potential unknown liabilities, including those related to our securities transactions, may materially affect a target business’s analysis of us as an attractive business partner.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
 
Financial Position
 
With funds available for an initial business combination in the amount of approximately $144,208,413 as of December 31, 2017 assuming no further redemptions and after payment of $7,000,000 in deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.

Effecting our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations unless we consummate a business combination on or before March 31, 2018 (or June 30, 2018 if approved by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders). We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement warrants, our capital stock or a combination of these in effecting our initial business combination. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of our IPO and the private placement of warrants (less redemptions of public shares in August 2017 and December 2017) are intended to be applied generally toward effecting an initial business combination as described in our prospectus, the proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any more specific purposes. Our initial business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and the registration process required by Federal and state securities laws relating to the offering of securities.
 
We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account.
 
In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
 
Sources of Target Business
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources as a result of our management’s experience, execution history and ability to deploy capital. These sources include, but are not limited to, investment bankers, private investment funds and other members of our network of business relationships. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is), except that we have agreed to pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial support and administrative services. Other than pursuant to this agreement, none of our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder’s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated acquisition of such target by us. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination
 
If we are able to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq, the Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We intend to fulfill the requirements of this Nasdaq rule even if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq at the relevant time. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. There is no basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination.
 
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough and extensive due diligence review, which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information that is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention of engaging any such third parties. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and will reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination. We will not pay finder’s or consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.

Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

· | Subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination
 
We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.

Type of Transaction | Whether Stockholder Approval is Required
--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 


10
--

 

Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:
 

· | we issue common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common stock or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Permitted Purchases of our Securities
 
In the event we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which requires insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.
 
In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
 
The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
 

11
--

 

Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders Upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is approximately $10.07 per public share as of December 31, 2017. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

· | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 

12
--

 

In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
 
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

· | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. A final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote; however, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be mailed to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation.
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our IPO in favor of our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of a business combination.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
 
Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than 15% of the shares sold in our IPO, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares”. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our IPO, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against initial our initial business combination.

Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
 
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable on the redemption date at the time specified in the related notice.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
 
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.

--

 

If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until March 31, 2018 (or June 30, 2018 if approved by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders).
 
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination
 
We have only until March 31, 2018 (or June 30, 2018 if approved by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders) to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by March 31, 2018 or extend such deadline to June 30, 2018 if approved by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses, which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by March 31, 2018 (or June 30, 2018 if approved by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders).
 
Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by March 31, 2018 (or June 30, 2018 if approved by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders). However, if the initial stockholders acquire public shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by March 31, 2018 (or June 30, 2018 if approved by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders).
 
Our sponsor, and our executive officers and directors agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement with us, that they would not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we did not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock on the date of such approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or any other person and, in connection with the extension sought at our annual meeting of stockholders on August 1, 2017 and special meeting of stockholders on December 14, 2017, we complied with these redemption requirements.
 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from funds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay franchise and income taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. If we dissolve and liquidate, we do not expect there to be any funds held outside the trust account remaining for distribution. However, to the extent such funds remain, after payment or provision for payment of our debts and other liabilities, the holders of the common stock remaining after we redeem the public shares will be entitled to receive all our remaining assets available for distribution to our stockholders, ratably in proportion to the number of shares of common stock held by them.
 
If we are to expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest or additional amounts added to the trust account, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.

Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than the underwriters for the IPO and our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, Messrs. Cody, Crate and Kalichstein, managing principals of an affiliate of the sponsor have agreed, jointly and severally, that they will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then Messrs. Cody, Crate and Kalichstein will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that Messrs. Cody, Crate and Kalichstein would be able to satisfy those obligations. Messrs. Cody, Crate and Kalichstein will not be personally liable to pay our debts and obligations except as provided above. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets and Messrs. Cody, Crate and Kalichstein assert that they are unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations or that they have no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against Messrs. Cody, Crate and Kalichstein to enforce their indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Messrs. Cody, Crate and Kalichstein to enforce their indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per public share.
 
We seek to reduce the possibility that Messrs. Cody, Crate and Kalichstein will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than the underwriters for the IPO and our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Messrs. Cody, Crate and Kalichstein are also not liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to proceeds held outside of the trust account with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from the trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.

Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of the trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by March 31, 2018 (or June 30, 2018 if approved by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders) may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of the trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by March 31, 2018 (or June 30, 2018 if approved by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders) is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by March 31, 2018 (or June 30, 2018 if approved by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay franchise and income taxes and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following March 31, 2018 (or June 30, 2018 if approved by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders) and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than the underwriters in the IPO and independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account.
 
As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, the managing principals may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the managing principals will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached our fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 31, 2018 (or June 30, 2018 if approved by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination or if they redeem their respective shares in connection with a vote seeking to amend Section 9.2(d) of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation in a manner that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 31, 2018 (or June 30, 2018 if approved by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders). In no other circumstances does a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.


Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our IPO that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend Section 9.2(d) of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation in a manner that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 31, 2018 (or June 30, 2018 if approved by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders), we will provide public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

· | prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination; 
· | if our initial business combination is not consummated by March 31, 2018, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account to our public stockholders; and 
· | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination. 

 
These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by a majority of the shares of common stock voted by our stockholders at a duly held stockholders meeting.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

Facilities
 
 We currently maintain our executive offices at 375 Park Avenue, 21st Floor, New York, NY 10152. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee that we pay an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have three executive officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that Messrs. Crate and Kalichstein or any other members of our management team devote in any time period varies based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
We have registered our units, common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financing reporting standards, or IFRS. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or IFRS or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP or IFRS. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer that is not an “emerging growth company” as described below will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
