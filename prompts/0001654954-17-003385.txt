 ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
  OVERVIEW
 
  We are a provider of cybersecurity and business advisory services principally in regulatory risk mitigation. We help clients in diverse industries by providing full scale cybersecurity operations and solutions, risk mitigation services, compilation with complex regulations, and leverageable and integrated technology. We work with our customers to assess, design, and provide customized solutions and advisory services that are tailored to address each client’s particular requirements and needs. Our clients range in size from Fortune 100 companies to mid-sized and owner-managed businesses across a broad range of industries including local, state, and federal agencies.
 
  We were incorporated on January 5, 2000 as Continuum Group C Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada, and did not conduct business as such. On November 5, 2004, we consummated a share exchange agreement dated as of October 12, 2004, among us, Premier Alliance Group, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (‘‘North Carolina Premier’’), and the shareholders of North Carolina Premier. As a result, North Carolina Premier merged into us and our name was changed to Premier Alliance Group, Inc. North Carolina Premier had commenced operations in 1995 and was founded by a group of experienced consultants that specialized in technology and financial services. In November 2004, and as a result of the merger with North Carolina Premier, we became part of a publicly traded company. In 2011, we re-domiciled under the laws of the state of Delaware. We have grown significantly both organically and through strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. Significant acquisitions we have completed include root9B, LLC in November 2013 and IPSA International, Inc. in February 2015.
 
  In September 2014, we announced a shift in strategy to accelerate the differentiated capabilities of our wholly-owned cybersecurity subsidiary root9B, LLC, and to focus primarily on cybersecurity and regulatory risk mitigation. In connection with this strategic shift, we changed our name and OTCQB ticker symbol as part of a rebranding effort, to root9B Technologies, Inc. and RTNB.
 
  In December 2016, we amended our certificate of incorporation to (i) effect a one-for-fifteen (1:15) reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock (the “Reverse Split”), (ii) decreased the number of authorized shares of its common stock from 125,000,000 to 30,000,000, and (iii) changed the name of the Company to root9B Holdings, Inc. When the Reverse Split became effective, every fifteen shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock were automatically converted into one share of common stock. The number of outstanding shares of common stock was reduced from approximately 84.4 million shares to approximately 5.6 million shares. As required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 260-10-55-12, “Earnings per Share”, all share and per-share computations presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the new number of shares after the Reverse Split.

  As a result of implementing the Reverse Split, the stated capital on our balance sheet attributable to our common stock, which consists of the par value per share multiplied by the aggregate number of shares issued and outstanding, was reduced in proportion to the size of the reverse split. Correspondingly, our additional paid-in capital account, which consists of the difference between our stated capital and the aggregate amount paid to us upon issuance of all currently outstanding shares of our stock, was increased by the amount by which the stated capital was reduced. Our stockholders’ equity, in the aggregate, remained unchanged.
 
  We also announced our commitment to re-focus our business to that of a pure-play cybersecurity company based on the operations of our wholly-owned subsidiary root9B, LLC. In connection therewith we announced a series of initiatives including the divestiture and/or downsizing of our non-cybersecuirty assets: IPSA International (“IPSA”), Control Engineering, Inc. (“CEI”), and Business Advisory Solutions (“BAS”) and the relocation of our corporate headquarters from Charlotte, NC to Colorado Springs, CO, which is home to root9B, LLC.
 
  On December 21, 2016, we were approved for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and commenced trading under the symbol “RTNB” at the opening of trading on that date.
 
  We completed the sale of CEI on December 31, 2016 and are in the final stages of completing the sale of IPSA in the first half of 2017. Each of these entities met the criteria for recognition as a “discontinued operation” under the guidelines detailed in ASC 205-20 “Discontinued Operations” during the fourth quarter of 2016 and are presented as such in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
  
  Our team is made up of individuals that have deep experience and training as cybersecurity experts, analysts, technology and engineering specialists, business and project consultants. We have hired our experienced professionals from a wide variety of organizations and key industries, which include cybersecurity, financial services, utilities, life science, technology, government and healthcare.
 
  OUR SERVICES
 
  We are a provider of cybersecurity and business advisory services principally in regulatory risk mitigation. Our services and solutions target risk mitigation, assisting with compliance, and maximizing profits by addressing core areas for businesses, primarily cybersecurity.
 
 In 2016, we announced a strategic shift to evolve into a pure-play cybersecurity company. In August 2016, our Board of Directors approved the evaluation of the divestiture of IPSA and the remaining components of the Energy Solutions businesses. A plan to divest those business units was approved during the three months ended December 31, 2016. As IPSA and the remaining components of the Energy Solutions businesses are considered discontinued operations, during 2016 we provided our services through two operating segments: Cyber Solutions and Business Advisory Solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 50% of our revenue from continuing operations was generated from Cyber Solutions and 50% was generated from Business Advisory Solutions.
 
  For further financial information on our segment results, see “Part II—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 19 “Segment Information” under “Part II—Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

 Business Advisory Solutions
 
  IPSA previously operated as a component of our BAS segment and was referred to as the IPSA/BAS segment; however, it has been removed from BAS as a result of being classified as discontinued operations.
 
 IPSA specializes in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) operational, investigative and remediation services, AML risk advisory and consulting services, conducting high-end investigations with expertise in services ranging from complex financial crime and intellectual property issues to conducting anti-bribery investigations or due diligence on a potential partner or customer. Our IPSA/Business Advisory Solutions team focuses on delivering solutions in both regulatory compliance and risk mitigation. The group works to assist our customers with compliance by applying our expertise in various regulations and deploying processes and automation. Similarly, we have deep expertise in risk assessment and work with our customers to develop solutions and structures to evaluate and mitigate risk. A typical customer is an organization that has complex business processes, large amounts of data to manage, and faces change driven by regulatory or market environments, or strategic, growth and profitability initiatives. Key areas of focus include large, mandated regulatory efforts including complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), BASEL ACCORDS (for financial institutions), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act initiatives.
 
 FINANCINGS
 
  In December 2016, we amended our certificate of incorporation to effect a one-for-fifteen (1:15) reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock. All share and per-share computations presented reflect the new number of shares after the Reverse Split.
 2016 Financing Activity
 
 On January 26, 2016, we entered into securities purchase agreements with a group of accredited investors, pursuant to which we issued approximately 15,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $16.50 per share. In addition, we issued warrants to purchase up to approximately 3,800 shares of our common stock in the aggregate, at an exercise price of $22.50 per share (the “Warrants”). The Warrants have a term of five years and may be exercised at any time from or after the date of issuance and contain customary, structural anti-dilution protection (i.e., stock splits, dividends, etc.). Upon closing of this equity financing, we received proceeds of $250,000.
 
 On February 24, 2016, we received proceeds of $1,257,000 in connection with our offer to amend and exercise warrants. In connection with the offering, warrant holders elected to exercise a total of approximately 76,000 of their $16.875 warrants at a reduced exercise price of $16.50 per share. We issued new warrants to the participants to purchase approximately 19,000 shares of common stock with a term of five (5) years and have an exercise price per share equal to $22.50. We incurred fees of $105,000 relative to this transaction.
 
 On March 3, 2016, we agreed to replace the approximately 32,000, $22.50 warrants from the November 5, 2015, December 23, 2015 and January 26, 2016 financings with approximately 128,000 five year warrants at $16.50 per share. These are subject to our customary, structural anti-dilution protections (i.e. stock splits, dividends, etc.).
 
 On March 10, 2016, we entered securities purchase agreements with accredited investors, advisory clients of Wellington Management Company, LLP (“Wellington”) and the Dan Wachtler Family Trust pursuant to which we issued approximately 338,000 shares of common stock at the purchase price of $16.50 per share.  In addition, we issued warrants to purchase up to approximately 338,000 shares of our common stock in the aggregate, at an exercise price of $16.50 per share.  The warrants have a term of five years and may be exercised on a cashless basis. Per the terms of the agreement, other than Dan Wachtler Family Trust, these purchasers are deemed to be “Qualified Purchasers” and are subject to the full-ratchet and anti-dilution protections explained below. Upon closing of this equity financing, we received proceeds of $5,585,000.

 In the event, prior to March 10, 2021, we issue “Additional Stock” (as defined in the Qualified Purchasers Securities Purchase Agreement) for per share consideration that is less than the Exercise Price of the Qualified Purchaser warrants, then the exercise price of each Warrant shall be reduced concurrently with such issue, to match the per share price of the dilutive issuance. Additional Stock as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement excludes common stock issued for exercises of stock options and warrants, conversions of promissory notes, and certain other adjustments as defined in the agreement.
 
 Additionally, in the event, prior to March 10, 2018, we issue “Additional Stock” for a per share consideration of less than $16.50 resulting in a “Dilutive Issuance” as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement, we shall issue shares to the Qualified Purchasers, for no additional consideration, based on a formula defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement.
 
 Furthermore, in the event, prior to March 10, 2018, we issue “Additional Stock” (as defined in the Qualified Purchasers Warrant Agreement) the number of warrant shares shall be increased by the number of shares necessary to ensure that the “Ownership Percentage” immediately following the issuance of any such shares shall remain equal to the Ownership Percentage immediately prior to such issuance. Ownership Percentage is calculated as the approximately 338,000 warrant shares issued to Qualified Investors divided by approximately 9,436,000 fully diluted shares agreed upon at the issuance date. Additional stock per the Warrant Agreement excludes all of the same items described above and also excludes shares issued for a strategic investment between $10 million and $25 million.
 
 In April 2016, we entered a Note Extension Agreement with existing note holders who held Promissory Notes for $1,600,000 scheduled to mature on May 21, 2016, whereby the note holders agreed to extend the maturity date of the Promissory notes to May 21, 2017. As consideration for the extension, the note holders received 32,000 five year warrants with an exercise price of $16.50 per share.
  
 On August 22, 2016, our Chairman and CEO loaned the Company $500,000. We issued an unsecured, non-convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $500,000, bearing interest at 4% per annum payable on or before August 22, 2017. The Company used the proceeds to fund working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes.
 
 On August 29, 2016, the Qualified Purchasers agreed that any issuance of Additional Stock, as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement, will exclude any new common stock or warrant shares issued as part of the 2016 Q3 Convertible Debt financing, as discussed in Note 12 “Long-Term Debt.”
 
 Qualified Purchasers cannot exercise their warrants unless their beneficial ownership of outstanding common stock falls below 9.9%. As of the March 10, 2016 issuance date and December 31, 2016, the Qualified Purchasers beneficially owned approximately 14% and 13%, respectively, of our common stock, thus, the warrants are not exercisable. If the Qualified Purchasers ownership of outstanding common stock falls below 9.9%, they are permitted to exercise warrants only to the extent that their beneficial ownership reaches 9.9%.
 
 Aside from legal fees, we incurred $398,000 in fees, plus the issuance of 14,000 five year warrants, with an exercise price of $16.50 in connection with this financing transaction. This amount is not reflected in the proceeds above.
 
 In September 2016 we entered into an offering of Secured Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Notes”) with an aggregate principal amount of up to $10,000,000, along with warrants to purchase shares (the “Warrant Shares”) of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), representing fifty percent (50%) warrant coverage (the “Warrants”), to certain accredited investors (the “Investors”), in a private placement, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement (the “Agreement”) by and between us and each Investor. As of December 31, 2016 we completed the sale of Notes with a total amount of $5,771,000, along with Warrants to purchase approximately 240,000 shares of Common Stock. On March 24, 2017, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the Agreement which amended each of Notes and Warrants held by the Noteholders and requires the Company to comply with new financial covenants, including that the Company maintain a positive Working Capital (as defined in the Agreement) as of each month end and average cash on hand at least equal to the largest payroll during the preceding 90 days (subject to certain adjustments), and requires the Company to provide regular financial reports to the Noteholders. The Third Amendment amends the definition of conversion price of the Notes from $12.00 per share to $10.00 per share and reduces the per share price floor for any interest payments made in shares of common stock from $12.00 per share to $10.00 per share, and amends the exercise price of the Warrants from $12.00 per share to $10.00 per share. The Third Amendment also allowed us to issue additional Notes (as amended). Subsequent to the Third Amendment, we issued an aggregate principal amount equal to $2,250,000, along with Warrants (as amended) to purchase approximately 112,500 shares of Common Stock. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we issued an aggregate principal amount equal to $3,000,000. See Note 12 “Long-Term Debt” for additional information regarding the other amendments to the Agreement.

 On February 8, 2017, our Chairman and CEO loaned the Company an additional $245,000. We issued an unsecured, non-convertible, promissory note in the principal amount of $245,000, bearing interest at the rate of 4.0% per annum payable on or before February 9, 2018. The Company intends to use the proceeds to fund working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes.
  
 OUR STRATEGY
  
  Our business focus is to work with the top levels of corporations to address major initiatives that fall under cybersecurity, as well as governance, risk and compliance (GRC) areas. Within GRC, the key emphasis today is around risk related to cybersecurity. With our cyber group, root9b, LLC, we take a new approach to combatting cyber activity, using a full solution encompassing active adversary pursuit (HUNT), cybersecurity and intelligence training, operational support, and associated technology and tools. In 2015, we built the Adversary Pursuit Center (“APC”) operations center where we conduct and provide remote HUNT services to our customers, which, we believe, offers a competitive advantage. We believe a full spectrum solution is needed to mitigate risk associated with cyber threats. As noted above, we announced our commitment to re-focus our business to that of a pure-play cybersecurity company during the second half of 2016.
 
  Our customers include medium and large corporations, law firms, financial institutions and US and Non-US Government agencies.
  
  OUR COMPETITION
 
  The market for professional services and solutions is highly competitive. It is also highly fragmented, with many providers and no single competitor maintaining clear market leadership. Our competition varies by segment, type of service provided, and the customer to whom services are provided. Our competitors in cybersecurity include FireEye, IBM, Palo Alto Networks, Cisco and Symantec; and in the regulatory risk arena include Deloitte, PwC, Ernst & Young, Accenture and various local boutique consulting firms. Many of our competitors are larger and better financed than we are and have substantial marketplace reputations.
 CONTRACTS
 
  When servicing customers, we typically sign master contracts for a one to three year period. The contracts typically set rules of engagement and can include pricing guidelines. The contracts manage the relationship and are not indicators of guaranteed work. Individual contracts, Purchase Orders, or Statements of Work, are put in place (under the master agreement) for each consultant or team assigned to the client site and cover logistics of length of contract, billing information and deliverables for the particular assignment. In most cases, contracts can be terminated by either party by providing ten to thirty days’ advance notice. To date, we have received a significant portion of revenues from large sales to a small number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had no sales to individual customers that accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had sales to two individual customers (PNC Bank and Duke Energy) that accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to the two customers of $1,634,319 and $1,203,099 were recorded in the BAS segment. Our operating results may be harmed if we are not able to complete one or more substantial sales to any large customers or are unable to collect accounts receivable from any of the large customers in any future period.
 EMPLOYEES
 
 As of December 31, 2016, we employed a total of 154 persons on a full time basis. We believe our employee relations are good. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
 GOING CONCERN AND LIQUIDITY
 
 We had a net loss from continuing operations of $18,299,187 for the year ended December 31, 2016, our working capital decreased $13,097,074 to $3,714,617 during the year ended December 31, 2016, and $1,600,000 of our promissory notes are due on May 21, 2017.

 During 2016, we incurred substantial costs in our efforts to grow the Cyber Solutions business segment. We hired additional personnel, engaged in strategic marketing and brand-building efforts, built-out the APC and other new offices opened, incurred legal fees related to trademarks and copyrights, and engaged in extensive research and development projects to enhance the Orkos and Orion HUNT software platforms. These investments in the Cyber Solutions segment were made in anticipation of revenue growth during 2017, of which, there can be no assurance.
  
 We anticipate requiring additional capital to grow our Cyber Solutions business segment, fund operating expenses, and make principal and interest payments on our promissory note obligations.
  
 During 2016 and early 2017, we took steps to mitigate these factors by:
  
   1)
 Entering into various debt and equity financing arrangements described in the “Financings” section above.

 
   2)
 Selling our CEI subsidiary on December 31, 2016 and working to complete the aforementioned IPSA transaction during the first half of 2017. This transaction is expected to provide between $6 million and $10 million of financing over the next three years.

 
   3)
 Focusing 100% of our efforts on the growth of the Cyber Solutions contract pipeline.

 
 Despite the measures discussed above, our current levels of cash on hand, working capital and proceeds from the debt offerings in the first quarter of 2017 have not been sufficient to alleviate our liquidity issues and, as a result, management has determined additional capital is required in order to sustain operations for one year beyond the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.
  
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern for at least the next 12 months following the issuance of our financial statements and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
