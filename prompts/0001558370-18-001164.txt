     Overview
     We are a biopharmaceutical company and leader in developing targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer. We use drug conjugation technology to create novel therapeutics and companion imaging agents for personalized targeted therapies. Our agents actively target receptors that are over-expressed on diseased cells relative to healthy cells, such as prostate specific membrane antigen, or PSMA, in prostate cancer. This targeted approach is designed to safely enable the delivery of highly potent drug payloads. The companion imaging agents are designed to identify patients whose disease over-expresses the target of the therapy and who are therefore more likely to benefit from treatment.
 On September 29, 2017, we entered into a Development and License Agreement, or the License Agreement, with ABX advanced biochemical compounds – Biomedizinische Forschungsreagenzien GmbH, or ABX, pursuant to which we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize PSMA‑617 agents, including the drug candidate known as 177Lu-PSMA‑617, a radioligand therapeutic, or RLT. Under the terms of the License Agreement, we will be responsible for, and bear the future costs of, worldwide development and commercialization of PSMA‑617, which ABX will supply. As consideration for the exclusive license, on September 29, 2017, we made an upfront cash payment of approximately $11.9 million to ABX, consisting of $12.0 million less an immaterial expense reimbursement amount, and issued to ABX 2,000,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase, in the aggregate, 4,000,000 shares of our common stock. The License Agreement obligates us to pay ABX regulatory milestone payments of up to $25.0 million, sales milestone payments of up to $135.0 million, and tiered royalties based on percentages of net sales beginning in the mid-teens and not to exceed the mid-twenties.
 177Lu-PSMA‑617 in Prostate Cancer. Following a successful End of Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we finalized the phase 3 VISION trial design and registration plan for 177Lu-PSMA-617. The trial will include two interim assessments of efficacy, which could potentially lead to an early approval for 177Lu-PSMA-617. We intend to initiate, in the second quarter of 2018, the VISION trial, an international, prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized phase 3 study of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in up to 750 patients with progressive PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC, who have received at least one novel androgen axis drug, or NAAD, and at least one taxane regimen. For development in the U.S., we acquired an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application from the prior sponsor, RadioMedix, in December 2017. 177Lu-PSMA‑617 utilizes a high affinity targeting ligand to direct potent radiotherapy to prostate cancer cells. The specific targeting of this therapy comes from the “ligand” portion of the RLT, which is a small molecule designed to bind to PSMA, a protein highly expressed on the cell surface of most prostate cancer cells but absent on most normal cells. The PSMA targeting ligand in 177Lu-PSMA‑617 is chemically attached to a therapeutic radioactive atom called Lutetium‑177 (177Lu), which releases an energetic beta particle designed to precisely deliver cell-killing radiation to the site of disease. Unlike traditional external beam radiotherapy, 177Lu-PSMA‑617, which is administered as a systemic injection, has been designed to directly target multiple sites of PSMA-positive prostate cancer throughout the body, including the bone and soft tissue, while bypassing the PSMA-negative cells. Prior to treatment with 177Lu-PSMA‑617, the patient’s expression of PSMA can be determined using imaging technology, allowing for personalization of treatment so that the optimum course of therapy might be selected. As highlighted in roughly 20 peer reviewed publications of studies in the post-chemotherapy compassionate use setting, 177Lu-PSMA‑617 demonstrated a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, response (defined as greater than 50% decline from baseline) in 40% to 60% of patients, and a Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST, response rate in soft tissue disease of between 40% and 50%.
 At the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in September 2017, Dr. Michael Hofman of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, Australia presented the results of an open-label, single-arm, non-randomized pilot trial of 177Lu-PSMA‑617 in 30 mCRPC patients. Primary endpoints included safety and efficacy as defined by PSA response, quality of life, and imaging response. The results showed a 57% PSA response rate (>50% reduction) and 71% interim RECIST response rate in soft tissue lesions in patients who had previously failed such conventional therapies as docetaxel, cabazitaxel, enzalutamide and abiraterone. Median overall survival was 12.7 months. The drug was well-tolerated, with a grade 3 or higher hematoxicity attributable to 177Lu-PSMA‑617 occurring in five (17%) patients and no renal toxicity. Significantly improved quality of life scores and reduction in pain scores were recorded in 37% and 43%

of patients, respectively. This trial has subsequently been expanded to 50 patients from the original 30, with updated results expected to be presented at the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, meeting in June 2018.
     CAR T-Cell Therapy. We are also developing a unique therapeutic approach that involves the re-targeting of potent immune cells, called chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, or CAR T-cells, to fight cancer. CAR T-cell therapies may be characterized as either allogeneic CAR T-cells, which are those that are engineered using T-cells from a single donor that are utilized in multiple patients, or autologous CAR T-cells, which are those that are engineered using a patient’s own T-cells. Our program utilizes an autologous approach. Traditional CAR T-cell therapies rely on the activity and specificity of T-cells that have been engineered to recognize a single naturally expressed target that, ideally, is only present on cancer cells, with no cross-reactivity to or targeting of healthy tissues. Our alternative strategy relies on an adaptor-controlled CAR T-cell that expresses a high affinity for a molecule called fluorescein isothiocyanate, or FITC, which is not naturally present in the human body. The activity and specificity of these adaptor-controlled CAR T-cells is dependent upon the administration of our proprietary CAR T adaptor molecules, or CAMs, that, once administered, bridge the CAR T-cell to the targeted cancer cell. The CAM attracts the CAR T-cell to the site of disease, causing the anti-cancer immune response of a traditional CAR T-cell therapy. However, unlike existing CAR T-cell technologies, our unique CAM-dependent technology makes possible the engineering of a single universal CAR T-cell that can be used to treat a wide range of cancer types. This is accomplished through the use of multiple CAMs, each of which is designed to bind the FITC molecule to a specific cancer type. In addition to enabling the treatment of multiple cancer types with an adaptor-controlled CAR T-cell, this controlling adaptor molecule technology is also designed to facilitate novel control strategies intended to increase the safety of CAR T-cell therapy.
     In March 2017, we announced our collaboration with Seattle Children’s Research Institute, or SCRI, and Dr. Michael Jensen for the development of our technology in the CAR T-cell immunotherapy setting. The aim of the research collaboration is to join our CAM technology with the CAR T-cell immunotherapy research efforts at the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research at SCRI, to move these potentially enabling technologies more quickly to patients in the clinic. In October 2017, we announced that we are focusing our adaptor-controlled CAR T-cell program on a targeted effort to generate proof-of-concept data. Our CAM is targeted to the folate receptor which is overexpressed in osteosarcoma, among other solid tumors. Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer with a high unmet need for new treatment alternatives, usually occurring in children and young adults.  In collaboration with Dr. Jensen, our current strategy is to pursue an IND application in the United States to enroll osteosarcoma patients in a phase 1 trial. Pre-clinical evaluations have been completed, and clinical evaluation is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2018.
     We currently have no commercial products and we have not received regulatory approval for, nor have we generated commercial revenue from, any of our product candidates.
     Our Technology Platforms
     We use drug conjugation technology to create novel therapeutics and companion imaging agents for personalized targeted therapies. Our targeting technology now includes advancements in both RLTs as well as adaptor-controlled CAR T-cell therapy. 
     Radioligand therapy. We have expanded our technology platform to RLTs. In this modality, a high affinity cancer targeting ligand is attached to a therapeutic radioactive atom, such as lutetium-177 or actinium-225. Lutetium-177 is a beta particle, which is much smaller than an alpha particle but can travel further to deliver the radioactive doses to more cells than an alpha particle. Actinium-225 is an alpha particle, which is much larger and delivers higher doses than beta particles but has a much smaller range for targeting cells. See “Pipeline” for information about our lutetium-177 RLT and actinium-225 RLT clinical trials. Once injected into a patient, our RLTs target tumors while largely bypassing healthy cells. Once inside the tumor, the radioactive atoms release energetic particles to precisely deliver a lethal dose of radiation to the cancer cells with minimal side effects to surrounding healthy tissue. PSMA-617, which targets PSMA receptors on mCRPC, is our most advanced RLT.

 Rendering of PSMA-617 RLT: 
    
     We are developing 177Lu-PSMA-617, an RLT, to direct potent radiotherapy to prostate cancer cells. The specific targeting of this therapy comes from the “ligand” portion of the RLT, which is a small molecule designed to bind to PSMA, a protein highly expressed on the cell surface of most prostate cancer cells but absent on most normal cells. The PSMA targeting ligand in 177Lu-PSMA-617, is chemically attached to the therapeutic radioactive atom lutetium-177 which releases an energetic beta particle to precisely deliver cell killing radiation to the site of disease. Unlike traditional external beam radiotherapy, 177Lu-PSMA-617 is administered as a systemic injection where it can directly target multiple sites of PSMA-positive prostate cancer throughout the body, including the bone and soft tissue, while bypassing the PSMA-negative cells. The expression of PSMA prior to treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 can be determined using whole body PSMA-directed imaging, allowing for personalization of treatment so that the best course of therapy might be selected. Based upon the EC1169 phase 1 trial, which completed enrollment in October 2017 and which selected patients for PSMA positivity in mCRPC patients, along with Dr. Michael Hofman’s patient selection for PSMA positivity in the 177Lu-PSMA‑617 Australian trial, it is believed that approximately 80-85% of mCRPC patients have PSMA-positive lesions and no PSMA-negative progressing lesions.
     CAR T-cell therapy using our CAM technology. We have leveraged our targeting ligand conjugate technology platform to develop a novel therapeutic approach to CAR T-cell therapy by using specially engineered autologous CAR T-cells that bind a molecule called FITC. Since FITC is not naturally present in the human body, these CAR T-cells will only recognize and kill cancer cells following the administration of our proprietary CAMs. Each CAM is constructed with one FITC molecule together with a distinctive tumor-targeting molecule, or ligand, that can specifically bind to cancer cells. By administering our CAMs, a patient’s tumor is rapidly “painted” with the FITC molecule which then attracts, and bridges, the CAR T-cell to the cancer cell to potentially cause a powerful, localized, and controllable anti-cancer immune response. Unlike existing CAR T-cell technologies, which target a single protein on the cell surface (often CD19 on certain lymphomas and leukemias), our unique CAM-dependent approach makes possible the engineering of a single universal CAR T-cell that can be directed to target multiple proteins and 

 
  3

 
consequently treat various cancer types. This is accomplished by developing multiple CAMs, each one containing a distinctive cancer targeting ligand, but the same FITC molecule. By design, the controlled adaptor approach allows for novel control strategies to increase the safety of the potent immune response of CAR T-cell therapy. Therefore, our CAR T-cell therapy program offers three potentially distinct advantages over existing approved CAR T-cell therapies:

1. | Control: Provides the health-care provider a degree of control over the body’s immune response to the therapy, both with respect to safety/tolerability (control of cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity) and efficacy (dose titration, dose skip, dose maintain, rescue agent);
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Universal: Provides the potential for a single CAR T-cell to be targeted to multiple proteins on the cell surface, addressing heterogeneity of disease inherent in many malignancies; and
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Safety: Provides for T-cell response activation to sufficiently drive efficacy, but not to the point of causing T-Cell exhaustion.

     We own or have rights to issued patents or patent applications worldwide covering our core technology, therapeutic product candidates and companion imaging agents. We recently in-licensed a patent portfolio directed to PSMA-617 from ABX. Patent applications directed to PSMA-617 are pending in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions.

 Our Strategy
     Since our inception, we have been focused on the development of our targeting ligand conjugate technology candidates. In June 2017, we discontinued clinical development of EC1456, our second-generation folate-targeted product candidate, and narrowed the focus of our phase 1 clinical development of EC1169, a PSMA-targeted product candidate, to include only the cohort of taxane-exposed mCRPC patients, which completed enrollment in October 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we determined not to invest further resources in the development of EC1169 beyond the completion of the phase 1 taxane-exposed cohort. In addition, in June 2017, we reduced our workforce by approximately 40% to align resources to focus on our highest value opportunities while maintaining key capabilities. 
     On September 29, 2017, we entered into the License Agreement with ABX, and on October 2, 2017, we announced our plan to primarily focus our resources on the development of 177Lu-PSMA‑617 and on a targeted effort to generate proof-of-concept data for our adaptor-controlled CAR T-cell program, and to explore out-licensing opportunities for all other development programs, such as EC2629, our dual-targeted folate-pro pyrrolobenzodiazepine, or pro-PBD, DNA crosslinker drug.
     The principal components of our business strategy are to:
    
· | Develop 177Lu-PSMA-617 for mCRPC. Following a successful End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, we finalized the phase 3 VISION trial design for 177Lu-PSMA-617. The trial will include two interim assessments of efficacy, which could potentially lead to an early approval for 177Lu-PSMA-617. We intend to initiate the VISION trial in the second quarter of 2018 and will enroll up to 750 patients. For development in the U.S., we acquired an IND application from the prior sponsor, RadioMedix, in December 2017. Unlike traditional external beam radiotherapy, 177Lu-PSMA‑617, which is administered as a systemic injection, has been designed to directly target multiple sites of PSMA-positive prostate cancer throughout the body, including both the bone and soft tissue, while bypassing the PSMA-negative cells. Targeting both metastatic bone and soft tissue disease is potentially an important differentiating feature compared to the existing radiotherapy alternative in mCRPC which targets only bone disease. Prior to treatment with 177Lu-PSMA‑617, the patient’s expression of PSMA can be determined using imaging technology, allowing for personalization of treatment so that the optimum course of therapy might be selected. Based upon our EC1169 phase 1 trial, which selected patients for PSMA positivity, along with Dr. Michael Hofman’s patient selection for PSMA positivity in the 177Lu-PSMA‑617 Australian trial, we believe that approximately 80-85% of mCRPC patients have PSMA-positive lesions and no PSMA-negative progressing lesions.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop companion imaging agents for each of our therapies. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to create targeted therapies where individual patients are selected based on the use of non-invasive diagnostic tools. Our companion imaging agents may lower the risk of development of our product candidates by allowing us to select for our clinical trials only those patients whose disease over-expresses the receptor targeted by our product candidates. This benefit may, following any regulatory approval, extend to clinical

practice by giving physicians the information they need to prescribe our product candidates to patients who are most likely to respond to our therapy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Build commercial capabilities and partner to maximize the value of our product candidates. We have retained or acquired all worldwide commercial rights to our product candidates. If we obtain the required regulatory approvals to commercialize our oncology product candidates in the United States and Europe, we intend to do so through our own focused sales force that we would build in connection with such commercialization efforts, or by co-promoting these product candidates in collaboration with one or more larger pharmaceutical companies that have established capabilities in commercializing cancer therapies. Outside of the United States and Europe, we will consider partnering with established international pharmaceutical companies to maximize the value of our pipeline.

      Precision Medicine
 We believe the future of medicine includes not only safer and more effective drugs, but also the ability to identify the appropriate therapy for a particular patient. We are committed to this approach, which is commonly referred to as personalized medicine or precision medicine. Our technology allows us to create companion imaging agents intended for use with our therapeutics. 
     Receptor Targets. We are developing novel therapeutics and companion imaging agents to identify cancer disease receptor targets, including PSMA receptor targets. These receptors are over-expressed on diseased cells. Our targeted therapeutics and companion imaging agents bind to these receptors and are internalized through a process known as endocytosis. This approach seeks to deliver potent therapy to diseased cells, while minimizing the impact on healthy cells.
     Rendering of PSMA-617 RLT binding to PSMA receptors:
    
     Companion Imaging Agents. Companion imaging agents are available or can be created for our therapeutics, which are designed to target the same diseased cells as the therapeutic and is easily seen with widely available nuclear imaging equipment. The companion imaging agent allows for real-time, full-body assessment of the receptor target without requiring an invasive tissue biopsy. Using full-body imaging, the receptor expression can be measured in every tumor

and monitored throughout treatment. Potential key advantages of companion imaging agents over tissue-based samples include:
    
· | minimally invasive (not requiring biopsy);
--+-------------------------------------------


· | real-time assessment of tumor receptor expression (as opposed to analysis based on archived tissue);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater sensitivity as the companion imaging agent binds to all forms of the receptor (tissue sample analysis may understate receptor expression by not recognizing all forms of receptor);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater specificity (tissue sample analysis may overstate receptor expression); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | full-body evaluation (as opposed to samples of tumor which may or may not be indicative of all areas of disease).

      Pipeline
 We own or have licensed worldwide commercial rights to a radioligand therapy platform and an adaptor-controlled CAR T-cell therapy platform with the potential for treating cancer and selecting patients who would likely benefit from the treatment. Our current focus is on the development of 177Lu-PSMA‑617 and on a targeted effort to generate proof-of-concept data for our CAR T-cell program. We are exploring out-licensing opportunities for other development programs, such as EC2629. A summary of our pipeline, with targeted timelines shown in the dotted lines, is as follows:
    
     Radioligand therapy for the targeted treatment of prostate cancer
 Following a successful End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, we finalized the phase 3 VISION trial design for 177Lu-PSMA-617. The trial will include two interim assessments of efficacy, which could potentially lead to an early approval for 177Lu-PSMA-617. We intend to initiate the VISION trial, an international, prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized phase 3 study of 177Lu-PSMA-617, in the second quarter of 2018. VISION will enroll up to 750 patients with PSMA-positive scans, randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 177Lu-PSMA-617 and best supportive care alone or in combination with a NAAD (physician’s choice) versus best supportive care alone or in combination with a NAAD (physician’s choice). Best supportive care alternatives are palliative in nature. Patients treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 will receive 7.4 GBq intravenously every six weeks for a maximum of six cycles. After four cycles, patients will be assessed for evidence of response, residual disease and tolerance to 177Lu-PSMA-617. If the patient meets the criteria, the investigator may administer two additional cycles. Patients will be monitored throughout the 6-10 month treatment period for survival, disease progression and adverse events. The trial will be stratified by the physician’s choice of using 

 
  7

 
a NAAD or not, so the use of NAAD’s will be balanced between trial arms. The primary endpoint of the study will be overall survival, or OS. Secondary endpoints include radiographic progression free survival, overall response rate determined by RECIST criteria, and time to first symptomatic skeletal event. Interim efficacy analyses of OS will be conducted at 50% and 70% of the 489 targeted events. There has been extensive clinical experience with 177Lu-PSMA-617 in over 400 patients, the studies of which have shown consistent results in pre-treated patient populations that have been diagnosed with PSMA-positive disease. Enrollment of the trial is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2018 and is expected to be completed in 18-24 months. 
     On February 26, 2018, we also announced an agreement with ITM Isotopen Technologien München AG, or ITM, which will provide clinical supply of no-carrier-added lutetium for the manufacturing of 177Lu-PSMA-617 for the VISION trial.
     In addition, we entered into a three-party agreement in October 2017, with the University of Sydney, or the University, and ANZUP, a cooperative cancer trials group operating in Australia and New Zealand pursuing research in genito-urinary malignancies, in which ANZUP will sponsor and undertake jointly with the University a randomized phase 2 multi-center TheraP trial of 177Lu-PSMA-617 versus cabazitaxel in 200 mCRPC patients. Under the three-party agreement, we will provide the PSMA-617 precursor molecule and financial support for the trial. We will have access to data generated from the trial, which is a potentially important supportive trial for future regulatory submissions. The primary financial obligations of the trial, along with labeling PSMA-617 with Lutetium-177, will be the responsibility of the University and ANZUP. The TheraP trial commenced enrollment in the first quarter of 2018.
     Adaptor-Controlled CAR T-cell Immunotherapy in Cancer
 Our first CAR T-cell therapy clinical trial will be led by Dr. Michael Jensen at SCRI and will assess folate-receptor (FR)-positive osteosarcoma patients. We will use a high affinity CAR T-cell therapy design plus our folate FITC CAM, EC17. Patients will be selected based on the presence of folate receptor positive disease. Following administration of the FITC-targeted CAR T-cells, the protocol provides for intra-patient dose escalation of our tumor-targeting CAMs. Patients will be monitored following each CAM dose to assess immune response, providing for rapid feedback on activity and safety of the therapy. This innovative design is intended to gradually build the immune response, thereby allowing for the potential to maximize antitumor activity with the intent to avoid severe cytokine release syndrome as well as CAR T-cell exhaustion. Pre-clinical evaluations have been completed, and clinical evaluation is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2018.
 Competition
     The life sciences industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from many pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are researching and marketing products designed to address various types of cancer and other indications we treat or may treat in the future. We are currently developing cancer therapeutics that will compete with other drugs and therapies that currently exist or are being developed. Also, certain of our product candidates may be clinically developed not as an initial first line therapy but as a therapy for patients whose tumors have developed resistance to first line chemotherapy, which limits its potential addressable market. Products we may develop in the future are also likely to face competition from other drugs and therapies.
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and drug development resources than we do. Large biopharmaceutical companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biopharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated by our competition. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies currently being developed and a greater availability of capital investment in those fields. These companies may also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do. Some of the companies developing products which may compete with our product candidates include: Adaptimmune Therapeutics PLC; Affimed N.V.; AstraZeneca PLC; Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc.; Atridia Pty LTD;  Autolus Limited; Bayer AG; Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; BioNTech AG; Bluebird Bio Inc.; Cancer Targeted Technology LLC; Celgene Corporation; Cellectis S.A.; Celyad S.A.; Editas Medicine, Inc.; ESSA Pharma Inc.; Gilead Sciences, Inc.; GlaxoSmithKline plc; Immatics Biotechnologies GmbH; Immunocore Limited; Innocrin

In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research, the results of which may result in direct competition with our product candidates. For example, the German Center of Cancer Research and University Medical Center Heidelberg, the owners of the patent rights to PSMA‑617 (which have been exclusively licensed to ABX and, in turn, exclusively sublicensed to us under the License Agreement), may continue to engage in research relating to RLTs or other cancer therapies, which could result in competition for 177Lu-PSMA‑617 or other product candidates that we advance from PSMA‑617.
 In certain instances, the drugs which will compete with our product candidates are widely available or established, existing standards of care. To compete effectively with these drugs, our product candidates will need to demonstrate advantages that lead to improved clinical safety or efficacy compared to these competitive products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve competitive advantages versus alternative drugs or therapies. If our competitors’ market products are more effective, safer or less expensive than our product candidates or reach the market sooner than our product candidates, we may not achieve commercial success.
 We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:

· | our ability to design and successfully execute appropriate clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ability to recruit and enroll patients for our clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the results of our clinical trials and the efficacy and safety of our product candidates;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the speed at which we develop our product candidates;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | achieving and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to our business;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, including labeling;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adequate levels of reimbursement under private and governmental health insurance plans, including Medicare;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ability to protect intellectual property rights related to our product candidates;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ability to commercialize and market any of our product candidates that may receive regulatory approval;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ability to have any partners manufacture and sell commercial quantities of any approved product candidates to the market;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | acceptance of our product candidates by physicians, other healthcare providers and patients;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ability to maintain access to capital to fully fund our clinical programs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the cost of treatment in relation to alternative therapies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advances in existing technological approaches or the development of new or different approaches, potentially eliminating the advantages in our drug discovery process that we believe we derive 

 
  9

 
from our research approach and proprietary technologies. Also, because our research approach integrates many technologies, it may be difficult for us to stay abreast of the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively.
 Manufacturing
     To date, our product candidates have been manufactured in small quantities for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials by third-party manufacturers. If the FDA, or other regulatory agencies approve any of our product candidates for commercial sale, we expect that we would continue to rely, at least initially, on third-party manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of any approved product candidates. These manufacturers may not be able to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any approved product candidates in a timely or economic manner, or at all. Significant scale-up of manufacturing may require additional validation studies, which the regulatory agencies must review and approve. Additionally, any third-party manufacturer we retain to manufacture our product candidates on a commercial scale must pass a pre-approval inspection for conformance to the cGMP before we can obtain approval of our product candidates. If we are unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for a product candidate in conformance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, the regulatory approval or commercial launch of such products may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply.
 Our product candidates require precise, high quality manufacturing. Failure by our contract manufacturers to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in testing or delivery, cost overruns, or other problems that could seriously harm our business. Contract manufacturers may encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and assurance. These manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and non-U.S. authorities to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards; however, we do not have control over third-party manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards.
     Sales and Marketing
     Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring, developing and securing our technology, undertaking pre-clinical testing and clinical studies of our product candidates and engaging in research and development under collaboration agreements. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain full regulatory approval, formulate and manufacture commercial-scale products, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, it is difficult to predict our future success and the viability of any commercial programs that we may take forward.     Research and Development; Raw Materials 
     For information regarding the amount spent by us on company-sponsored research and development activities during each of the last three fiscal years, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein.
     We procure raw material components for our product candidates from a core group of principal suppliers. In order to meet our clinical trial needs, we are required to enter into agreements with third party manufacturing facilities for certain production needs and for fill and finish capabilities. On February 26, 2018, we announced an agreement with ITM, which will provide clinical supply of no-carrier-added lutetium for the manufacturing of 177Lu-PSMA-617 for the VISION trial.
     Employees
     In June 2017, we reduced our workforce by 40% to align resources to focus on our highest value opportunities while maintaining key capabilities. As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 44 full-time employees, 33 of whom were engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a 

 
  10

 
collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced a work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
     Government Regulation
     Government authorities in the United States (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.     United States Government Regulation
     In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and related regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the imposition of a clinical hold on trials by the FDA or an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.     The Investigational New Drug Process
     An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured before commencing clinical trials of any new drug candidate in humans in the U.S.
     The central focus of the initial IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold until any outstanding concerns or questions are resolved.
     Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical site’s IRB before the trials may be initiated. All participants in clinical trials must provide their informed consent in writing prior to their enrollment in the trial.
     The clinical investigation of an investigational drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of a clinical investigation are as follows:
    
· | Phase 1. Phase 1 involves the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on efficacy. During phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  11

 

scientifically valid phase 2 clinical trials. The total number of participants included in phase 1 clinical trials varies, but generally ranges from 20 to 80.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the efficacy of the investigational drug for a particular indication in patients with the disease or condition under study, and to further define safety, tolerability, and optimal dosage. Phase 2 clinical trials can be uncontrolled or controlled trials, and are closely monitored and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are typically well-controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting efficacy of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, safety, and effectiveness to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The decision to terminate development of an investigational drug may be made by either a health authority body such as the FDA or by us for various reasons. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB. This group provides a recommendation of whether or not a trial may move forward at pre-specified check points based on access that only the DSMB maintains to available data from the trial. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. We may decide to suspend or terminate development based on evolving business objectives and/or the competitive climate.
     In addition, there are requirements and industry guidelines that require the posting of ongoing clinical trials on public registries and the disclosure of designated clinical trial results and related payments to healthcare professionals.
     Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug information is submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application, or NDA, except under limited circumstances, requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
     The NDA Approval Process
     In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, an NDA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication to the FDA’s satisfaction. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent pre-clinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators.
     The FDA will initially review the NDA for completeness before it accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
    
 
  12

 

 Based on phase 3 clinical trial results submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant a priority review designation may be granted to a product by the FDA, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months. Priority review is given where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists, or a significant improvement compared to marketed products is possible. If criteria are not met for priority review, the standard FDA review period is ten months. The timing of the priority or standard review period begins after the initial 60 day decision regarding acceptability of the submission for filing and substantive review. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. Other designations, such as breakthrough or fast track designation, are also potentially available and can help expedite development and approval of investigational new drugs. 
     Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
     The testing and approval process for a drug requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and this process may take several years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our product candidates or companion imaging agents and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. Even if the FDA approves a product candidate or companion imaging agent, it may limit the approved indications for use or place other conditions on approval that could restrict commercial application, such as a requirement that we implement special risk management measures through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
     Post-Approval Regulation
     After regulatory approval, if any, of a drug product is obtained, we may be required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug. In addition, as a holder of an approved NDA, we would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and effectiveness information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to assure and preserve the drug product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record-keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

 Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation
     In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
     Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
     The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements.
     To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. This application is similar to the NDA in the United States, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures, and our product candidates and companion imaging agents fall under the centralized authorization procedure.
     The European Commission may grant conditional marketing authorization for a product that addresses an unmet medical need while additional development work is being completed. Conditional marketing authorization is subject to annual review, and such authorization may be limited or even withdrawn if subsequent development work is not satisfactory or fails to confirm the clinical benefit of the product.
     The European Commission implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Union. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the European Commission that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that: are derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering; contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; and are officially designated orphan medicines.
     Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
     For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the other applicable regulatory requirements.
     If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

 
  14

 

     Compliance
     During all phases of development (pre- and post-marketing), failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the following actions by the FDA or other regulatory authorities: imposition of a clinical hold on trials; refusal to approve pending applications; withdrawal of an approval; warning letters; product recalls; product seizures; total or partial suspension of production or distribution; product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products; injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
     We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections or inspections by other regulatory authorities may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s or other regulatory authorities’ policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
     Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
     Significant uncertainty exists as to the third-party coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Consolidation and integration among healthcare providers and health plans has increased their purchasing power and impacted reimbursement. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
     In 2003, the United States government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. Federal, state and local governments in the United States continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, and its amendment, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, were enacted in 2010. Since then, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted, including the Budget Control Act of 2011, which requires reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year from April 2013 through 2024 unless additional congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers. We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform 

 
  15

 
measures to be adopted in the future, which could limit payments or otherwise negatively impact reimbursement for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing.
     We also face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the PPACA, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. The repeal of PPACA’s individual mandate may reduce the number of insured patients in the U.S. and have an adverse impact on revenue received by healthcare providers. Further, the impact of de-regulation efforts on healthcare providers is uncertain. Shortly after taking office, President Trump began a series of initiatives to reduce government regulation.  Executive Order 13771 requires federal agencies to identify two existing regulations to be repealed whenever a new regulation is proposed (referred to as the “2-for-1” Executive Order).  The 2-for-1 Executive Order requires each federal agency to appoint a Regulatory Reform Officer and Regulatory Reform Task Forces to ensure that agencies effectively carry out these regulatory reform initiatives. At this point, it is unclear what the impact on regulation of reimbursement the 2-for-1 Executive Order or its results will have. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business.
     Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
     The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
     Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
     In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 and the PPACA, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Under the Veterans Health Care Act, or VHCA, drug companies are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Legislative changes purport to require that discounted prices be offered for certain U.S. Department of Defense purchases for its TRICARE program via a rebate system. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
    
 
  16

 

 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities or register their sales representatives, as well as prohibiting pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
     Patents and Proprietary Rights
     Because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products to market, biopharmaceutical companies have traditionally placed considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for significant new technologies, products and processes.
     Our success depends in part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our radioligand therapy and adaptor-controlled CAR T-cell platform technologies, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. As a matter of policy, we seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing and prosecuting United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology and our in-licensed assets, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
     We have filed patent applications directed to our two main areas of focus: anti-tumor therapeutics, including applications covering radiotherapy, and diagnostics; and adaptor-controlled CAR T-cell therapeutics and diagnostics, in many major developed markets around the world. 
     We have recently in-licensed an asset known as PSMA-617 from ABX.  The patent portfolio directed to PSMA-617 was filed in 2014 and thus, absent patent term adjustments or extensions, is set to expire in 2034. The patent applications directed to PSMA-617 are owned by the German Center of Cancer Research and University Medical Center Heidelberg, which have licensed those assets to ABX, which in turn has sublicensed those assets to us.
     The License Agreement with ABX can be terminated by either party if the other party becomes insolvent or commits a material breach of its obligations and, within 60 days following notice of such breach, fails to cure the breach (or, for breaches that cannot be cured within 60 days, fails to commence substantial remedial actions).  Any material breach that is specific to a particular country triggers termination rights only as to that country, provided that any material breach relating to any country designated as a “major market” is treated as a breach as to the entire world.  We have the right to terminate the License Agreement in our discretion following any event that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the commercial potential in the U.S. of any product covered by the license.  Absent such an event, however, our discretionary right to terminate the ABX license is conditioned upon our having met certain investment and diligence obligations and, under some circumstances, would result in acceleration of any unpaid development milestone payments. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Obligations and Commitments for a description of our payment obligations under the ABX license agreement.
     Based on research we fund at Purdue University, we have entered into three exclusive, worldwide in-licenses for a number of patents and patent applications owned by the Purdue Research Foundation related to select folate-targeted technology, select technology related to PSMA, and select technology related to other ligands. The folate-technology license was originally entered into on July 17, 1998 with an effective date as of December 21, 1995, and was restated on October 21, 1998. The PSMA license was entered into on March 1, 2010. The license to other technologies was entered 

 
  17

 
into in 2014 with an effective date of July 1, 2013. Under these three licenses, over 80 patents and published applications are licensed to us.
     We may terminate the Purdue Research Foundation licenses without cause with 60 days notice for the folate and PSMA licenses and three months notice for the license directed to other ligands. Purdue Research Foundation may terminate any of the licenses for material default by us which is not cured within 90 days notice, or upon 60 days notice, for the folate and PSMA licenses, in the event we fail to meet public demand for approved products covered by the licensed patents after a six month cure period following commercial introduction. The Purdue Research Foundation may terminate the license to other ligands if we fail to make a payment within 60 days of notice under the specific terms of the license. The folate and PSMA licenses also contain provisions allowing Purdue Research Foundation to terminate upon our bankruptcy. We have annual minimum royalty obligations to Purdue Research Foundation, as well as royalty obligations based on sales of products that are designed, developed or tested using the licensed technology, and milestone obligations based upon the achievement of specific scientific, clinical and regulatory milestones. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Obligations and Commitments for a description of our payment obligations under the license agreements with the Purdue Research Foundation.
     We collaborate with Purdue University on CAR T-cell therapy research and are thus co-owners on some patent applications with the Purdue Research Foundation.
     Most of our portfolio consists of intellectual property we exclusively license from ABX, Purdue Research Foundation or which we own ourselves. Generally, the intellectual property licensed from Purdue Research Foundation is early stage and relates to methods that were invented in the laboratory of Professor Philip Low. Internally, we typically develop these methods further and refine them to determine the commercial applicability. Additionally, these early-stage patents often provide us protection from competitors while we evaluate commercial possibilities of a specific program. For example, some of the patents we licensed from Purdue Research Foundation cover drug conjugates of PSMA.
     Due to the use of federal funds in the development of some folate-related technology, the U.S. government has the irrevocable, royalty-free, paid-up right to practice and have practiced certain patents throughout the world, should it choose to exercise such rights.
     Our development strategy also employs lifecycle management positions. For example, we explore the potential for filing patent applications claiming methods of treatment combining our molecules with other treatments. Such strategies may provide additional patent protection even after the expiration of composition of matter patent protection for our intellectual property. As a result, our general guiding strategy is to obtain patent coverage for innovations that show a clinical benefit to patients and an economic opportunity for us.
     In addition, in October 2007, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license with R&D Biopharmaceuticals to research, develop, and commercialize products containing conjugates of folate receptor targeting compounds and tubulysin compounds. In February 2011, this licensing agreement was assigned by R&D Biopharmaceuticals to Trientlgasse.
     The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent.
     The patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent.

 The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-U.S. jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products.
     While we pursue patent protection and enforcement of our product candidates and aspects of our technologies when appropriate, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position. To protect this competitive position, we regularly enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with third parties, including employees, independent contractors, suppliers and collaborators. Our employment policy requires each new employee to enter into an agreement containing provisions generally prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of us and providing that any invention conceived by an employee within the scope of his or her employment duties is our exclusive property. We have a similar policy with respect to independent contractors, generally requiring independent contractors to enter into an agreement containing provisions generally prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of us and providing that any invention conceived by an independent contractor within the scope of his or her services is our exclusive property, with the exception of contracts with universities and colleges that may be unable to make such assignments. Furthermore, our know-how that is accessed by third parties through collaborations and research and development contracts and through our relationships with scientific consultants is generally protected through confidentiality agreements with the appropriate parties. We cannot, however, assure you that these protective arrangements will be honored by third parties, including employees, independent contractors, suppliers and collaborators, or that these arrangements will effectively protect our rights relating to unpatented proprietary information, trade secrets and know-how. In addition, we cannot assure you that other parties will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our proprietary information and technologies.
     There can be no assurance that any of our patent applications or any that we in-license will result in granted patents. Additionally, there can be no assurance that our patents or any that we in-license (collectively “Patents”) will provide significant protection, competitive advantage or commercial benefit. The validity and enforceability of patents issued to biopharmaceutical companies has proven highly uncertain. For example, legal considerations surrounding the validity of patents in the fields of biopharmaceuticals are in transition, and we cannot assure you that the historical legal standards surrounding questions of validity will continue to be applied or that current defenses relating to issued Patents in these fields will be sufficient in the future. In addition, we cannot assure you as to the degree and range of protections any of our Patents, if issued, may afford us or whether Patents will be issued. For example, Patents which may issue to us may be subjected to further governmental review that may ultimately result in the reduction of their scope of protection, and pending Patent applications of ours or those that we in-license may have their requested breadth of protection significantly limited before being issued, if issued at all. Further, since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot assure you that we were the first creator of inventions covered by pending Patent applications of ours or those that we in-license, or that we, or the applicants for the assets we in-license, were the first to file patent applications for these inventions.
     Many biopharmaceutical companies and university and research institutions have filed patent applications or have received patents in our areas of product development. Many of these entities’ applications, patents and other intellectual property rights could prevent us from obtaining Patents or could call into question the validity of any of our Patents, if issued, or could otherwise adversely affect our ability to develop, manufacture or commercialize our product candidates. In addition, certain parts of our technology originated from third-party sources. These third-party sources include academic, government and other research laboratories, as well as the public domain. If the use of technology incorporated into or used to produce our product candidates is challenged, or if a conflicting patent issued to others is upheld in the courts or if a conflicting patent application filed by others is issued as a patent and is upheld, we may be unable to market one or more of our product candidates, or we may be required to obtain a license to market those product candidates. To contend with these possibilities, we may have to enter into license agreements in the future with third parties for technologies that may be useful or necessary for the manufacture or commercialization of some of our product candidates. In addition, we are routinely in discussions with academic and commercial entities that hold patents on technology or processes that we may find necessary in order to engage in some of our activities. However, we cannot 

 
  19

 
assure you that these licenses, or any others that we may be required to obtain to market our product candidates, will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that we will be able to develop alternative technologies if we cannot obtain required licenses.
     To protect our rights to any of our issued Patents and proprietary information, we may need to litigate against infringing third parties, or avail ourselves of the courts or participate in hearings to determine the scope and validity of those Patents or other proprietary rights. These types of proceedings are often costly and could be very time-consuming to us, and we cannot assure you that the deciding authorities will rule in our favor. An unfavorable decision could allow third parties to use our technology without being required to pay us licensing fees or may compel us to license needed technologies to avoid infringing third-party patent and proprietary rights, or even could result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our Patents or forfeiture of the rights associated with our Patents or pending Patent applications of ours or those that we in-license. Although we believe that we would have valid defenses to allegations that our current product candidates, production methods and other activities infringe the valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of any third parties, we cannot be certain that a third party will not challenge our position in the future. Even if some of these activities were found to infringe a third party’s patent rights, we may be found to be exempt from infringement under 35 U.S.C. §271(e) to the extent that these are found to be pre-commercialization activities related to our seeking regulatory approval for a product candidate. However, the scope of protection under 35 U.S.C. §271(e) is uncertain and we cannot assure you that any defense under 35 U.S.C. §271(e) would be successful. Further, the defense under 35 U.S.C. §271(e) is only available for pre-commercialization activities, and could not be used as a defense for sale and marketing of any of our product candidates. There has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, significant litigation in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries regarding patent and other intellectual property rights.
