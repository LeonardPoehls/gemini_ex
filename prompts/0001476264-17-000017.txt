Item 1. Business
General
The Company was organized in 2009 under the laws of Virginia to operate as a bank holding company and is headquartered in Reston, Virginia. The Company is the holding company for WashingtonFirst Bank, which operates 19 full-service banking offices throughout the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The Bank opened for business in April 2004 and is chartered by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Through the end of 2016, the FDIC served as its primary federal regulator. In January 2017, the Bank became a member of the Federal Reserve System and, as such, is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board going forward. With the acquisition of 1st Portfolio, Inc. in July 2015, the Company provides wealth management services with offices located in Fairfax, Virginia; and mortgage banking services through the Bank's wholly owned subsidiary, WashingtonFirst Mortgage which operates in two locations: Fairfax, Virginia and Rockville, Maryland. Wealth Advisors operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and WashingtonFirst Mortgage is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank.
WashingtonFirst’s growth strategy is to pursue organic growth as well as acquisition opportunities within its target market area of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The Company has completed two branch acquisitions, two whole-bank acquisitions, an FDIC-assisted acquisition, and the acquisition of a mortgage company and a wealth management company. Additionally, the Company has a demonstrated track record of consistent organic growth in assets and profitability since its inception by hiring and developing skilled personnel, and creating and maintaining a solid infrastructure to support continued business growth on a sound basis.
WashingtonFirst’s business strategy is to provide its customers with highly qualified personal and customized service utilizing effective technology solutions and delivery channels. The Bank’s marketing efforts are directed to prospective clients who value high quality service and who are, or have the potential to become, highly profitable. WashingtonFirst’s view of the financial services market is that community banks must be effective in providing quality, tailored services to their customers rather than competing with large national institutions on a head-to-head basis for broad-based consumer business.
Revenues are primarily derived from interest and fees received in connection with loans, deposits, and investments, as well as mortgage banking and wealth advisory fees. Major expenses include compensation and employee benefits, interest expense on deposits and borrowings, and operating expenses.
Products and Services
The Bank offers a comprehensive range of commercial banking products and services to small-to-medium sized businesses, not-for-profit organizations, professional service firms and individuals in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The Mortgage Company provides residential mortgage lending services to customers in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan and greater mid-Atlantic areas. Wealth Advisors specializes in assisting select affluent business owners, executives and families preserve and grow their wealth, providing comprehensive wealth management and business retirement plan services. More information on WashingtonFirst’s services is available on-line at www.wfbi.com.
Business and Consumer Lending
WashingtonFirst’s lending activities include commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, construction and development loans and consumer loans. Loans originated by the Bank are primarily classified as loans held for investment. Loans originated by the Mortgage Company are primarily classified as loans held for sale.
Lending activities are subject to lending limits imposed by federal and state law. While different limits apply in certain circumstances based on the type of loan, the Bank’s lending limit to any one borrower on loans that are not fully secured by readily marketable or other permissible collateral generally is equal to 15 percent of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank’s legal lending limit was $32.2 million. For loan amounts exceeding WashingtonFirst’s legal lending limits or internal lending policies, the Bank has established relationships with various correspondent banks to sell loan participations.
WashingtonFirst has an established credit policy that includes procedures for underwriting each type of loan and lending personnel have been assigned specific loan approval authorities based upon their experience. Loans in excess of an individual loan officer’s authority are presented to the OLC or ELC for approval. The OLC and ELC each meet weekly to facilitate a timely approval process for WashingtonFirst’s clients. Loans are approved based on the borrower’s capacity for credit, collateral and sources of repayment. Loans are actively monitored to detect any potential performance issues. WashingtonFirst manages its loans within the context of a risk grading system developed by management based upon extensive experience in administering loan portfolios in its market. Payment performance is carefully monitored for all loans. When loan repayment is dependent upon an operating business or investment real estate, periodic financial reports, site visits and select asset verification procedures are used to ensure that WashingtonFirst accurately rates the relative risk of its assets. Based upon criteria established by management and the Bank’s board 
6

of directors, the degree of monitoring is escalated or relaxed for any given borrower based upon WashingtonFirst’s assessment of the future repayment risk.
Acquisition, Development & Construction Loans. These loans generally fall into one of four types: first, loans to construct owner-occupied commercial buildings; second, loans to individuals that are ultimately used to acquire property and construct an owner-occupied residence; third, loans to builders for the purpose of acquiring property and constructing homes for sale to consumers; and fourth, loans to developers for the purpose of acquiring land to be developed into finished lots for the ultimate construction of residential or commercial buildings. Loans of these types are generally secured by the subject property within limits established by WashingtonFirst’s board of directors based upon an assessment of market conditions and updated from time to time. The loans typically carry recourse to principal borrowers. In addition to the repayment risk associated with loans to individuals and businesses, loans in this category carry construction completion risk. To address this additional risk, loans of this type are subject to additional administrative procedures designed to verify and ensure progress of the project in accordance with allocated funding, project specifications and time frames.
Commercial Real Estate Loans. These loans generally fall into one of three categories: loans supporting owner-occupied commercial property; loans supporting properties used by non-profit organizations such as trade associations, churches or charter schools where repayment is dependent upon the cash flow of the non-profit organizations; and loans supporting a commercial property leased to third parties for investment. Commercial real estate loans are secured by the subject property and underwritten to policy standards. Policy standards, approved by WashingtonFirst’s board of directors from time to time, set forth, among other considerations, loan to value limits, cash flow coverage ratios, and standards governing the general creditworthiness of the obligors. Loans secured by commercial real estate originated by the Bank are primarily classified as loans held for investment.
Residential Real Estate Loans. Through the Mortgage Company, WashingtonFirst offers a variety of competitive mortgage loan products to homeowners and investors of 1-4 family properties. Mortgage loans originated are generally sold in the secondary market through purchase agreements with institutional investors with servicing released. Loans in these categories are underwritten to standards within a traditional consumer framework that is periodically reviewed and updated by management and the board of directors, and includes such considerations as repayment source and capacity, collateral value, credit history, savings pattern, and stability. The Mortgage Company’s activities rely on insurance provided by HUD and the VA. In addition, the Mortgage Company underwrites mortgage loans in accordance with guidelines for programs under Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that make these loans marketable in the secondary market.
Commercial and Industrial Loans. These loans are to businesses or individuals for business purposes. Typically the loan proceeds are used to support working capital and the acquisition of fixed assets of an operating business or to refinance a loan payable to another financial institution that was originally made for a similar purpose. Each loan is underwritten based upon WashingtonFirst’s assessment of the obligor’s ability to generate operating cash flow in the future necessary to repay the loan. To address the risks associated with the uncertainties of future cash flow, these loans are generally secured by assets owned by the business or its principal shareholders and the principal shareholders are typically required to guarantee the loan.
Consumer Loans. Consumer loans are loans to individuals for a stated purpose such as to finance a car or boat, to refinance debt, or to fund general working capital needs. These loans are generally extended in a single disbursement and repaid over a specified period of time. Most loans are well secured with assets other than real estate, such as marketable securities or automobiles. In general, management discourages unsecured lending. Loans in this category are underwritten to standards within a traditional consumer framework that is periodically reviewed and updated by WashingtonFirst’s management and board of directors, and includes such considerations as repayment source and capacity, collateral value, credit history, savings pattern, and stability.
Deposit Services
Deposits are the primary source of funding for the Bank. The Bank offers an array of traditional banking products and services which are priced competitively. Deposit services include business and personal checking, NOW accounts, tiered savings and money market and time deposit accounts with varying maturity structures and customer options. A complete individual retirement account program is also available. The Bank also participates in the CDARS program which functions to assure full FDIC insurance for participating Bank customers.
Deposit services include cash management services such as electronic banking, sweep accounts, lockbox, account reconciliation services, merchant card depository, safe deposit boxes, remote deposit capture and ACH origination. After hour depository and ATM services are also available. In addition, the Bank offers a full range of on-line banking services for both personal and commercial accounts and has a mobile banking application for both.

Wealth Management
Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Wealth Advisors, the Company offers fee based investment advisory services to high net worth individuals, business owners and executives, and families to preserve and grow their wealth. In addition, the Company provides financial and retirement planning services. Custodial services are offered through third party contractual arrangements with Pershing Securities and Charles Schwab Securities. Wealth Advisors maintains offices in Fairfax, Virginia.
Employees
At December 31, 2016, WashingtonFirst had 253 employees, of which 178 were employees of the Bank, 69 were employees of the Mortgage Company, and 6 were employees of Wealth Advisors; compared to 220 employees of the Bank as of December 31, 2015. None of WashingtonFirst’s employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Management considers employee relations to be good. The Company provides employees with a comprehensive employee benefit program which includes group life, health and dental insurance, paid time off, sick leave, educational opportunities, a cash incentive plan, an equity award incentive plan for key employees, and a 401(k) plan with discretionary employer match.
Market Area and Competition
WashingtonFirst serves the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. With a population of more than 7 million, the region is the 5th largest market in the U.S. Our market area is economically diverse, well-educated, has one of the highest levels of household income in the nation, and has low unemployment relative to most other regions. Significant business sectors include federal and local government, professional and business services, education, health, leisure and hospitality, as well as non-profit trade associations, universities and major hospital systems. The Company experiences strong competition in all aspects of its business, competing with other banks and non-bank financial institutions (e.g., savings and loan associations, credit unions, small loan companies, finance companies, and mortgage companies) that offer similar services in its market area. Much of this competition comes from larger financial institutions headquartered outside the region, each of which has greater financial and other resources than WashingtonFirst and is able to conduct large advertising campaigns and offer incentives. To attract business in this competitive environment, WashingtonFirst offers a full array of competitively priced, traditional community bank products and services, and relies on personal contact by its officers and directors, local promotional activities, and the ability to provide personally tailored services to small businesses and professionals.
Regulation
Financial institutions and their holding companies are extensively regulated under federal and state law. Consequently, the growth and earnings performance of the Company and its subsidiaries can be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the statutes administered by, and the regulations and policies of, various governmental regulatory authorities including, but not limited to, the Bureau, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the SEC, HUD, certain state securities commissions, U.S. Treasury, as well as federal and state taxing authorities. The effect of such statutes, regulations and policies can be significant, and cannot be predicted with a high degree of certainty.
The following description summarizes some of the laws to which the Company and its subsidiaries are subject. References herein to applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries thereof, do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations. Any change in applicable law or regulations may have a material effect on the business of the Company and its subsidiaries.
WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc.
The Company is a bank holding company registered under the BHC Act and subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. The BHC Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. The Company is registered in Virginia with the Bureau under the financial institution holding company laws of Virginia and is subject to regulation and supervision by the Bureau. The Company is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, both as administered by the SEC. As a company with securities listed in the NASDAQ, it is subject to the rules of the NASDAQ for listed companies.
Generally, the Company is prohibited, with certain limited exceptions, from acquiring a direct or indirect interest in or control of more than 5.0 percent of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or financial or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiary banks, except the Company may engage in and may own shares of companies engaged in certain activities found by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In approving acquisitions by bank holding companies of companies engaged in banking- related activities or the addition of activities, the Federal Reserve considers a number of factors and weighs the expected benefits to the public (such as greater convenience, increased 
8

competition, or gains in efficiency) against the risks of possible adverse effects (such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices).
The GLB Act allows a bank holding company or other company to certify status as a financial holding company, which allows such company to engage in activities that are financial in nature, that are incidental to such activities, or are complementary to such activities. The GLB Act enumerates certain activities that are deemed financial in nature, such as underwriting insurance or acting as an insurance principal, agent or broker, underwriting, dealing in or making markets in securities, and engaging in merchant banking under certain restrictions. It also authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to determine by regulation what other activities are financial in nature, or incidental or complementary thereto. The GLB Act allows a wider array of companies to own banks, which could result in companies with resources substantially in excess of the Company's entering into competition with the Company and the Bank. The Company has not elected financial holding company status.
Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y, for example, generally requires a holding company to give the Federal Reserve prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10.0 percent or more of its consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. Depending upon the circumstances, the Federal Reserve could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.
The Federal Reserve has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations, and can assess civil money penalties for violation of laws, regulations or orders, for participation in an unsafe or unsound practice or breach of fiduciary duty.
Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends; Source of Strength. The Company is regarded as a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The principal source of the Company’s revenue is dividends received from the Bank. As described in more detail below, both state and federal law place limitations on the amount that banks may pay in dividends, which the Bank must adhere to when paying dividends to the Company. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income earned over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not pay cash dividends at levels that undermine the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. Given the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy in relation to the organization’s overall asset quality, level of current and prospective earnings, and composition, level and quality of capital. The guidance provides that the Company inform and consult with the Federal Reserve prior to declaring and paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in an adverse change to the Company’s capital structure. See Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Dividend Policy.”
Virginia state law also restricts dividends to shareholders of the Company. The Company’s shareholders are entitled to receive dividends if, as and when declared by the Company’s Board of Directors in accordance with Section 13.1-653 of the Code of Virginia. Generally, dividends may be paid out of surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.
Under Federal Reserve policy, a bank holding company has historically been required to act as a source of financial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act, codifies this policy as a statutory requirement. The Company is required to commit resources to support the Bank, and this obligation may arise at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. As discussed below, a bank holding company, in certain circumstances, could be required to guarantee the capital plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary.
In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the trustee will be deemed to have assumed and will be required to cure immediately any deficit under any commitment by the debtor holding company to any of the federal banking agencies to maintain the capital of the insured depository institution. Any claim for breach of such obligation will generally have priority over most other unsecured claims.
Anti-Tying Restrictions. Bank holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extensions of credit, to other non-banking services offered by a holding company or its affiliates.
Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act bars banking organizations, such as the Company, from engaging in proprietary trading and from sponsoring and investing in hedge funds and private equity funds, except as permitted under certain circumstances, pursuant to a provision commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule.” Under the Dodd-Frank Act, proprietary trading generally means trading by a banking entity or its affiliate for its trading account. The Volcker Rule restrictions apply to the Company and its subsidiaries.

Capital Adequacy Requirements. The Federal Reserve has adopted a system using risk-based capital guidelines under a two-tier capital framework to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies. Tier 1 capital generally consists of common shareholders’ equity, retained earnings, a limited amount of qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities and non-controlling interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain intangibles. Tier 2 capital generally consists of certain hybrid capital instruments and perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt securities and a limited amount of subordinated debt, qualifying preferred stock, loan loss allowance, and unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities.
Under the guidelines, specific categories of assets are assigned different risk weights, based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset. These risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a “risk-weighted” asset base. The guidelines require a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 percent (of which at least 4.0 percent is required to consist of Tier 1 capital elements). Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the Federal Reserve uses a leverage ratio as an additional tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies. The leverage ratio is a company’s Tier 1 capital divided by its average total consolidated assets. Certain highly rated bank holding companies may maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0 percent, but other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent.
Additional information on WashingtonFirst’s capital ratios may be found in Part II, Item 7 - “Management Discussion & Analysis” under the heading “Capital Resources” and in Part II, Item 8 - “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements”, and is incorporated herein by reference.
See “WashingtonFirst Bank” below for more specifics on capital requirements.
Basel III Capital Adequacy Requirements. In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation ("Basel III"). The regulations adopted by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies, when fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve and FDIC issued a final rule implementing Basel III capital requirements as well as certain other regulatory capital and other requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules apply to all insured depository institutions and bank holding companies with consolidated assets over $500 million, such as WashingtonFirst. In broad terms, the regulations increase the required quality and quantity of the capital base, reduce the range of instruments that count as capital and increase the risk-weighted asset assessment for certain types of activities. The Company and the Bank are obligated to maintain higher capital ratios as the new regulatory standards were phased in beginning on January 1, 2015. The Company remains well capitalized under Basel III.
The Company’s $25 million 6% fixed-to-floating subordinated notes due 2025 are intended to qualify for Tier II capital treatment under Basel III.
See “WashingtonFirst Bank” below for more specifics on Basel III.
Imposition of Liability for Undercapitalized Subsidiaries. Bank regulators are required to take “prompt corrective action” to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions whose capital declines below certain levels. In the event an institution becomes “undercapitalized,” it must submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary’s compliance with the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy.
The aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank is limited to the lesser of 5 percent of the institution’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to cause the institution to be adequately capitalized. The bank regulators have greater power in situations where an institution becomes significantly or critically undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. For example, a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior Federal Reserve approval of proposed dividends, or might be required to consent to a consolidation or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates.
Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies. The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank, if after such acquisition it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5 percent of the voting shares of such bank. In approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve is required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, and various competitive factors. Acquisitions by Virginia bank holding companies are also subject to the provisions of Virginia law.
Control Acquisitions. The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Any entity is required to obtain 
10

the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act before acquiring 25 percent (5 percent in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company) or more of a bank holding company’s or bank’s voting securities, or otherwise obtaining control or a controlling influence over the company or bank. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the regulations of the Federal Reserve, the acquisition of 10 percent or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control of a bank holding company. The statute and regulations set forth standards and certain presumptions concerning acquisition of control. Acquisitions of control are also subject to regulation by Virginia law.
In most circumstances, an entity that owns 25 percent or more of the total equity of a banking organization owns enough of the capital resources to have a controlling influence over such banking organization for purposes of the BHC Act. On September 22, 2008, the Federal Reserve issued a policy statement on equity investments in banks and bank holding companies. The key statutory limit restricting a non-controlling investor to 24.9 percent of voting securities for purposes of the BHC Act remains, but the policy statement loosens some restrictions on entities within this limit. The provisions of the policy statement generally allow the Federal Reserve to be able to conclude that an entity is not “controlling” if it does not own in excess of 15 percent of the voting power and 33 percent of the total equity of the bank holding company or bank. Depending on the nature of the overall investment and the capital structure of the banking organization, based on the policy statement the Federal Reserve will permit non-controlling investments in the form of voting and nonvoting shares that represent in the aggregate (i) less than one-third of the total equity of the banking organization (and less than one-third of any class of voting securities, assuming conversion of all convertible nonvoting securities held by the entity) and (ii) less than 15 percent of any class of voting securities of the organization.
WashingtonFirst Bank
During 2016, as a Virginia state non-member bank, the Bank was principally supervised, examined and regulated by the Bureau and the FDIC. Because the Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC, it is also subject to regulation pursuant to the FRA and FDIA. In January 2017, the Bank became a member of the FRB and will be regulated by the FRB going forward as the Bank’s primary federal regulator. The aspects of its business which are regulated under federal law include security requirements, reserve requirements, investments, transactions with affiliates, amounts it may lend to certain borrowers, business activities in which it may engage and minimum capital requirements. It is also subject to applicable provisions of Virginia law insofar as they do not conflict with and are not preempted by federal law, including laws relating to usury, various consumer and commercial loans and the operation of branch offices. Such supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the deposit insurance funds of the FDIC and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of WashingtonFirst’s shareholders or creditors. The following references to applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries which do not purport to be complete and which are qualified in their entirety by references to such statutes and regulations.
Equivalence to National Bank Powers. To the extent that the Virginia laws and regulations may have allowed state-chartered banks to engage in a broader range of activities than national banks, the FDICIA has operated to limit this authority. The FDICIA provides that no state bank or subsidiary thereof may engage as principal in any activity not permitted for national banks, unless the institution complies with applicable capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity poses no significant risk to the insurance fund. In general, statutory restrictions on the activities of banks are aimed at protecting the safety and soundness of depository institutions.
Branching. Virginia law provides that a Virginia-chartered bank can establish a branch anywhere in Virginia provided that the branch is approved in advance by The Bureau. The branch must also be approved by the bank’s primary federal regulator. Approval is based on a number of factors, including financial history, capital adequacy, earnings prospects, character of management, needs of the community and consistency with corporate powers. The Dodd-Frank Act permits insured state banks to engage in de novo interstate branching if the laws of the state where the new branch is to be established would permit the establishment of the branch if it were chartered by such state. Currently, the Bank operates branch offices in Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C.
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Transactions between the Bank and its non-banking affiliates, including WashingtonFirst and any of its future non-banking subsidiaries, are subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with that bank. In general, Section 23A imposes limits on the amount of such transactions, and also requires certain levels of collateral for loans to affiliated parties. It also limits the amount of advances to third parties which are collateralized by the securities or obligations of WashingtonFirst or its subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization. 
Affiliate transactions are also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which generally requires certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other non-affiliated persons. The Federal Reserve has also issued Regulation W, which codifies prior pronouncements under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and interpretive guidance with respect to affiliate transactions.
11

The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal shareholders and their related interests (collectively referred to in this section as “insiders”) contained in the FRA and Regulation O apply to all insured depository institutions and their subsidiaries. These restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests. In the aggregate, these loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus, and the FDIC may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions. The Dodd-Frank Act adds new requirements to bank transactions with insiders by requiring that credit exposure to derivatives and certain other transactions be treated as loans for the insider loan and general lending limits. 
Restrictions on Distribution of Subsidiary Bank Dividends and Assets. The Bank’s payment of dividends is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal and state banking laws, regulations and authorities. Dividends paid by the Bank have provided a substantial part of the Company’s operating funds and for the foreseeable future it is anticipated that dividends paid by the Bank to the Company will continue to be the Company’s principal source of operating funds. The Bank’s ability to pay dividends is subject to the restrictions previously described for the Company. In addition, capital adequacy requirements serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. Under federal law, the Bank cannot pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, the Bank will be “undercapitalized.” The FDIC may declare a dividend payment to be unsafe and unsound even though the Bank would continue to meet its capital requirements after the dividend.
Because the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, its right to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon the subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. In the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of the institution to its shareholders, including any depository institution holding company (such as WashingtonFirst) or any shareholder or creditor thereof.
Examinations. The Bank is subject to annual examinations by its primary federal regulator. These examinations review areas such as capital adequacy, reserves, loan portfolio quality and management, consumer and other compliance issues, investments and management practices. Based upon such an evaluation, bank regulators may revalue the assets of the institution and require that it establish specific reserves to compensate for the difference between the regulator-determined value and the book value of such assets. The Bureau also conducts examinations of state banks but may accept the results of a federal examination in lieu of conducting an independent examination. In addition, federal and state regulators may elect to conduct a joint examination.
In addition to these regular exams, an insured bank is required to furnish quarterly and annual reports to its primary federal regulator. Regulators may exercise cease and desist or other supervisory powers over an insured bank if its actions represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law. Further, any proposed addition of any individual to the board of directors of the Bank or the employment of any individual as a senior executive officer of the Bank, or the change in responsibility of such an officer, will be subject to 90 days prior written notice to its federal regulator if the Bank is not in compliance with the applicable minimum capital requirements, is otherwise a troubled institution or the regulators determines that such prior notice is appropriate for the Bank. The regulators then has the opportunity to disapprove any such appointment.
Audit Reports. Pursuant to Part 363 of the FDIC rules and regulations, insured institutions with total assets of $500.0 million or more must submit annual audit reports prepared by independent auditors to federal and state regulators. In some instances, the audit report of the institution’s holding company can be used to satisfy this requirement. Auditors must receive examination reports, supervisory agreements and reports of enforcement actions. For institutions with total assets of $1.0 billion or more, financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, management’s certifications concerning responsibility for the financial statements, internal controls and compliance with legal requirements designated by the Bank’s primary federal regulator, and an attestation by the auditor relating to the internal controls must be submitted. For institutions with total assets of more than $3.0 billion, independent auditors may be required to review quarterly financial statements. FDICIA requires that independent audit committees be formed, consisting of outside directors only. The committees of such institutions must include members with experience in banking or financial management, must have access to outside counsel, and must not include representatives of large customers. 
Change in Control. The Change in Bank Control Act and regulations promulgated by the FDIC require that, depending on the particular circumstances, notice must be furnished to the FDIC and not disapproved prior to any person or group of persons acquiring “control” of an insured bank, subject to exemptions for certain transactions. For purposes of the Change in Bank Control Act, control is conclusively presumed to exist if a person acquires the power to vote, directly or indirectly, 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the bank. In addition, the term includes the power to direct the management and policies of the bank. Control is rebuttably presumed to exist if a person acquires 10 percent or more but less than 25 percent of any class of voting securities and either the bank has registered securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, or no other person will own a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction. The regulations provide a procedure for challenging the rebuttable control presumption. Acquisitions of control are also subject to the provisions of Virginia law.

Capital Adequacy Requirements. Similar to the Federal Reserve’s requirements for bank holding companies, the FDIC has adopted regulations establishing minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of insured banks. The FDIC’s risk-based and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria. Banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios. The federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant. Regulatory guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.
The FDIC’s regulations require insured banks to have and maintain a “Tier 1 risk-based capital” ratio of at least 4.0 percent and a “total risk-based capital” ratio of at least 8.0 percent of total risk-adjusted assets. Assets are adjusted under the risk-based guidelines to take into account different risk characteristics, with the categories ranging from zero percent (requiring no risk-based capital) for assets such as cash, to 100 percent for the bulk of assets which are typically held by a bank holding company, including certain multi-family residential and commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans and consumer loans. Residential first mortgage loans on one to four family residential real estate and certain seasoned multi-family residential real estate loans, which are not 90 days or more past due or nonperforming and which have been made in accordance with prudent underwriting standards are assigned a 50% level in the risk-weighing system, as are certain privately-issued mortgage-backed securities representing indirect ownership of such loans. Off-balance sheet items also are adjusted to take into account certain risk characteristics. Total risk-based capital represents the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, as those terms are defined in the regulations.
The FDIC also requires insured banks to meet a minimum “leverage ratio” of Tier 1 capital to total assets of not less than 3.0 percent for a bank that is not anticipating or experiencing significant growth and is highly rated (i.e., has a composite rating of 1 on a scale of 1 to 5). Banks that the FDIC determines are anticipating or experiencing significant growth or that are not highly rated must meet a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 percent.
Basel III Capital Requirements. Basel III became applicable to the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015. The Basel III final capital framework, among other things, (i) introduced as a new capital measure "CET1", (ii) specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and "Additional Tier 1 capital" instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) defined CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expanded the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations. 
When fully phased in by January 1, 2019, Basel III will require banks to maintain: (i) as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.5%; (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, or 8.5%; (iii) a minimum ratio of Total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0% plus the capital conservation buffer, or 10.5%; and (iv) as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter).
Basel III also provides for a "countercyclical capital buffer," generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk that would be a CET1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% when fully implemented. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) may face constraints on their ability to pay dividends, effect equity repurchases and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers, which constraints vary based on the amount of the shortfall. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, and will increase each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
The Basel III framework provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. 
As part of the definition of CET1 capital, Basel III includes a requirement that banking institutions include the amount of AOCI (consisting primarily of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, which are not required to be treated as other-than-temporary impairment, net of tax) in calculating regulatory capital, unless the institution makes a one-time opt-out election from this provision in connection with the filing of its first regulatory reports after applicability of Basel III to that institution. Basel III also proposes a 4% minimum leverage ratio. The Company and Bank elected to exclude AOCI in calculating regulatory capital.
Basel III also makes changes to the manner of calculating risk-weighted assets. New methodologies for determining risk-weighted assets in the general capital rules are included, including revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation, and a greater recognition of financial collateral and a wider range of eligible guarantors. These also include risk-weighting of equity exposures and past due loans; and higher (greater than 100%) risk-weighting for certain commercial real estate exposures that have higher credit risk profiles, 
13

including higher loan to value and equity components. In particular, loans categorized as loans HVCRE loans are required to be assigned a 150% risk-weighting, and require additional capital support. HVCRE loans are defined to include any credit facility that finances or has financed the acquisition, development or construction of real property, unless it finances 1-4 family residential properties; certain community development investments; agricultural land used or usable for, and whose value is based on, agricultural use; or commercial real estate projects in which: (i) the LTV is less than the applicable maximum supervisory LTV ratio established by the bank regulatory agencies; (ii) the borrower has contributed cash or unencumbered readily marketable assets, or has paid development expenses out of pocket, equal to at least 15% of the appraised "as completed" value; (iii) the borrower contributes its 15% before the bank advances any funds; and (iv) the capital contributed by the borrower, and any funds internally generated by the project, are contractually required to remain in the project until the facility is converted to permanent financing, sold or paid in full. 
Overall, the Company believes that implementation of Basel III has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's or the Bank's capital ratios, earnings, shareholder's equity, or its ability to pay dividends, effect stock repurchases or pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. See Part II, Item 7., “Capital Resources.”
Prompt Corrective Action. Under Section 38 of the FDIA, each federal banking agency is required to implement a system of prompt corrective action for institutions which it regulates. The federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement the system of prompt corrective action established by Section 38 of the FDIA. Basel III integrates the new capital requirements into the prompt corrective action category definitions. The following capital requirements apply to the Company for purposes of Section 38.

Capital Category | Total Risk-BasedCapital Ratio | Tier 1 Risk-BasedCapital Ratio | Common EquityTier 1 Capital Ratio | Leverage Ratio | Tangible Equity to Assets | Supplemental Leverage Ratio
Well Capitalized | 10% or greater | 8% or greater | 6.5% or greater | 5% or greater | n/a | n/a 
Adequately Capitalized | 8% or greater | 6% or greater | 4.5% or greater | 4% or greater | n/a | 3% or greater 
Undercapitalized | Less than 8% | Less than 6% | Less than 4.5% | Less than 4% | n/a | Less than 3% 
Significantly Undercapitalized | Less than 6% | Less than 4% | Less than 3% | Less than 3% | n/a | n/a 
Critically Undercapitalized | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | Less than 2% | n/a 

Based on the most recent notification from the FDIC, the Bank was classified as “well capitalized” for purposes of the FDIC’s prompt corrective action regulations.
An institution generally must file a written capital restoration plan which meets specified requirements with an appropriate federal banking agency within 45 days of the date the institution receives notice or is deemed to have notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. A federal banking agency must provide the institution with written notice of approval or disapproval within 60 days after receiving a capital restoration plan, subject to extensions by the applicable agency. 
An institution which is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guaranty by each company that controls the institution. Such guaranty shall be limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5.0% of the institution's total assets at the time the institution was notified or deemed to have notice that it was undercapitalized or (ii) the amount necessary at such time to restore the relevant capital measures of the institution to the levels required for the institution to be classified as adequately capitalized. Such a guaranty shall expire after the federal banking agency notifies the institution that it has remained adequately capitalized for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. An institution which fails to submit a written capital restoration plan within the requisite period, including any required performance guaranty, or fails in any material respect to implement a capital restoration plan, shall be subject to the restrictions in Section 38 of the FDIA which are applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions. 
A "critically undercapitalized institution" is to be placed in conservatorship or receivership within 90 days unless the FDIC formally determines that forbearance from such action would better protect the deposit insurance fund. Unless the FDIC or other appropriate federal banking regulatory agency makes specific further findings and certifies that the institution is viable and is not expected to fail, an institution that remains critically undercapitalized on average during the fourth calendar quarter after the date it becomes critically undercapitalized must be placed in receivership. The general rule is that the FDIC will be appointed as receiver within 90 days after a bank becomes critically undercapitalized unless extremely good cause is shown and an extension is agreed to by the federal regulators. In general, good cause is defined as capital, which has been raised and is imminently available for infusion into the Bank except for certain technical requirements, which may delay the infusion for a period of time beyond the 90 day time period. 
Immediately upon becoming undercapitalized, an institution shall become subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the FDIA, which (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that the appropriate federal banking agency monitor the 
14

condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institution's assets; and (v) require prior approval of certain expansion proposals. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the deposit insurance fund, subject in certain cases to specified procedures. These discretionary supervisory actions include: requiring the institution to raise additional capital; restricting transactions with affiliates; requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser; and any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate. These and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions. 
Additionally, under Section 11(c)(5) of the FDIA, a conservator or receiver may be appointed for an institution where: (i) an institution's obligations exceed its assets; (ii) there is substantial dissipation of the institution's assets or earnings as a result of any violation of law or any unsafe or unsound practice; (iii) the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition; (iv) there is a willful violation of a cease-and-desist order; (v) the institution is unable to pay its obligations in the ordinary course of business; (vi) losses or threatened losses deplete all or substantially all of an institution's capital, and there is no reasonable prospect of becoming "adequately capitalized" without assistance; (vii) there is any violation of law or unsafe or unsound practice or condition that is likely to cause insolvency or substantial dissipation of assets or earnings, weaken the institution's condition, or otherwise seriously prejudice the interests of depositors or the insurance fund; (viii) an institution ceases to be insured; (ix) the institution is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect that it will become adequately capitalized, fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so, or fails to submit or materially implement a capital restoration plan; or (x) the institution is critically undercapitalized or otherwise has substantially insufficient capital. 
Deposit Insurance Assessments. The Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC through the DIF, to the extent provided by law, and the Bank must pay assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance protection. The FDIC maintains the DIF by designating a required reserve ratio. If the reserve ratio falls below the designated level, the FDIC must adopt a restoration plan that provides that the DIF will return to an acceptable level generally within five years. The designated reserve ratio is currently set at 2.0 percent. The FDIC has the discretion to price deposit insurance according to the risk for all insured institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio. The DIF reserve ratio is maintained by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium based upon statutory factors. Under its current regulations, the FDIC imposes assessments for deposit insurance according to a depository institution’s ranking in one of four risk categories based upon supervisory and capital evaluations. The assessment rate for an individual institution is determined according to a formula based on a combination of weighted average CAMELS component ratings, financial ratios and, for institutions that have long-term debt ratings, the average ratings of its long-term debt. The assessment base is determined using average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity rather than using adjusted domestic deposits. Current assessment rates, calculated on the revised assessment base, generally range from 2.5 to 9 basis points for Risk Category I institutions, 9 to 24 basis points for Risk Category II institutions, 18 to 33 basis points for Risk Category III institutions, and 30 to 45 basis points for Risk Category IV institutions. For large institutions (generally those with total assets of $10 billion or more), which does not include the Bank, the initial base assessment rate ranges from 5 to 35 basis points on an annualized basis. After the effect of potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could range from 2.5 to 45 basis points on an annualized basis. Assessment rates for large institutions are calculated using a scorecard that combines CAMELS ratings and certain forward-looking financial measures to assess the risk a large institution poses to the DIF.
Enforcement Powers. The FDIC and the other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory agreements could subject WashingtonFirst or the Bank, as well as officers, directors and other institution-affiliated parties of these organizations, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties. In addition to the grounds discussed above under “–Corrective Measures for Capital Deficiencies,” the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the FDIC (or the FDIC may appoint itself, under certain circumstances) as conservator or receiver for a banking institution if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist, including, without limitation, the fact that the banking institution is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized, fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so, fails to submit a timely and acceptable capital restoration plan or materially fails to implement an accepted capital restoration plan. The Bureau also has broad enforcement powers over the Bank, including the power to impose orders, remove officers and directors, impose fines and appoint supervisors and conservators.
Brokered Deposit Restrictions. Adequately capitalized institutions cannot accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the FDIC, and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on any deposits. Undercapitalized institutions may not accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposits. As previously noted, the Bank is categorized as “well capitalized.”
Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations. The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100 percent or more of total capital, or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-owner occupied, non-farm residential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300 percent or more of total capital and 
15

the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50 percent or more during the prior 36 months. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. The Bank has a high concentration of real estate loans and has implemented heightened risk management practices to monitor and control its exposure. Such risk management practices include but are not limited to: the establishment of an active credit quality process, detailed reporting and analysis, stress testing of the loan portfolio, and a robust credit workout process.
Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA and the corresponding regulations are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service area, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks. These regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. Federal banking agencies are required to make public a rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA. In the case of a bank holding company, the CRA performance record of the banks involved in the transaction are reviewed in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with any other bank holding company. An unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction. As of its most recent exam, the Bank’s compliance with CRA was rated “satisfactory.”
Consumer Laws and Regulations. In addition to the laws and regulations discussed herein, the Bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers. The Bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations.
Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Legislation. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA Patriot Act substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA Patriot Act requires financial institutions to prohibit correspondent accounts with foreign shell banks, establish an anti-money laundering program that includes employee training and an independent audit, follow minimum standards for identifying customers and maintaining records of the identification information and make regular comparisons of customers against agency lists of suspected terrorists, their organizations and money launderers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the “OFAC” rules based on their administration by OFAC. The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.
Privacy. WashingtonFirst and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous privacy-related laws and their implementing regulations. For example, the GLB Act imposes requirements on financial institutions with respect to customer privacy. The GLB Act generally prohibits disclosure of customer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the customer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to customers annually, and are required to comply with state law if it is more protective of customer privacy than the GLB Act.
Dodd-Frank Act. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act regulatory reform legislation became law. This law broadly affects the financial services industry by implementing changes to the financial regulatory landscape aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector, including provisions that, among other things, enhance prudential standards for banks and bank holding companies inclusive of capital, leverage, liquidity, concentration and exposure measures. In addition, traditional bank regulatory principles such as restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders were enhanced. The Dodd-Frank Act also contains reforms of consumer mortgage lending practices and creates the CFPB which is granted broad authority over consumer financial practices of 
16

banks and others. WashingtonFirst is not subject to regulation by the CFPB, as it has supervisory authority over depository institutions with total assets of $10.0 billion or greater. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the CFPB’s focus on consumer regulation and the risks posed by financial products will ultimately impact institutions such as WashingtonFirst. 
It is expected as the specific new or incremental requirements applicable to WashingtonFirst become effective that the costs and difficulties of remaining compliant with all such requirements will increase. Provisions in the legislation that affect deposit insurance assessments and payment of interest on demand deposits could increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate. A number of aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are still subject to rule making and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on WashingtonFirst, its customers or the financial industry more generally.
Incentive Compensation. Federal bank regulators issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation programs of financial institutions do not undermine the safety and soundness of banking organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. On April 14, 2011, federal bank regulators published a proposed interagency rule to implement certain incentive compensation requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the proposed rule, financial institutions must prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk-taking that are deemed excessive or that may lead to material losses. The agencies recently revised the proposed rule and it has not yet been finalized, however, the interagency guidance remains in place.
The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as WashingtonFirst, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
WashingtonFirst Mortgage
Mortgage Company activities are subject to the rules and regulations of, and examination by HUD, FHA, VA and various state regulatory authorities with respect to originating, processing and selling mortgage loans.  Those rules and regulations, among other things, establish standards for loan origination, prohibit discrimination, provide for inspections and appraisals of property, require credit reports on prospective borrowers and, in some cases, restrict certain loan features, and fix maximum interest rates and fees.  In addition to other federal laws, mortgage origination activities are subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, TILA, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, RESPA, and Home Ownership Equity Protection Act, and the regulations promulgated under these acts, including the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rules issued by the CFPB.  These laws prohibit discrimination, require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit and settlement costs, limit payment for settlement services to the reasonable value of the services rendered and require the maintenance and disclosure of information regarding the disposition of mortgage applications based on race, gender, geographical distribution and income level.
Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Rule. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued a final rule on January 10, 2013 (effective on January 10, 2014), amending Regulation Z as implemented by the TILA, requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers' ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision: (i) current or reasonably expected income or assets; (ii) current employment status; (iii) the monthly payment on the covered transaction; (iv) the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan; (v) the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations; (vi) current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; (vii) the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and (viii) credit history. Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate "qualified mortgages," which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a "qualified mortgage" is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. Qualified mortgages that are "higher-priced" (e.g. sub-prime loans) garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not "higher-priced" (e.g. prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance. 
Mortgage Loan Originator Compensation. Previously existing regulations concerning the compensation of mortgage loan originators have been amended. As a result of these amendments, mortgage loan originators may not receive compensation based on a mortgage 
17

transaction’s terms or conditions other than the amount of credit extended under the mortgage loan. Further, the new standards limit the total points and fees that a bank and/or a broker may charge on conforming and jumbo loans to 3% of the total loan amount. Mortgage loan originators may receive compensation from a consumer or from a lender, but not both. These rules contain requirements designed to prohibit mortgage loan originators from “steering” consumers to loans that provide mortgage loan originators with greater compensation. In addition, the rules contain other requirements concerning recordkeeping.
Mortgage Loan Servicing. The CFPB implemented servicing rules requiring servicers meet certain benchmarks for loan servicing and customer service in general. Servicers must provide periodic billing statements and certain required notices and acknowledgments, promptly credit borrowers’ accounts for payments received and promptly investigate complaints by borrowers and are required to take additional steps before purchasing insurance to protect the lender’s interest in the property. These servicing rules also call for additional notice, review and timing requirements with respect to delinquent borrowers.
Wealth Advisors
Investment Adviser Regulation. Wealth Advisors is subject to regulation under federal and state securities laws. Wealth Advisors is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Advisers Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary, record keeping, operational, and disclosure obligations. Wealth Advisors is also subject to regulation under the securities laws of certain states. The foregoing laws and regulations generally grant the supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict Wealth Advisors, a subsidiary of the Company, from conducting its business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed in the event of noncompliance include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on business activities for specified periods of time, revocations as an investment adviser and/or other registrations, and other fines.
