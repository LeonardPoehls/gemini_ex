TARGET CUSTOMER 
 Our target customer is a woman who is both style conscious and value seeking. She is typically married and college educated. She may be multi-cultural, works at least part-time in a professional position and has above-average household income. 
MERCHANDISING, PURCHASING AND PRICING 
 Our fashion assortment is driven primarily by seasonal fashion trends and a focus on name brand and designer merchandise complemented by a select program of private label and proprietary/exclusive merchandise. During 2017, approximately nine percent of our sales were from private label or proprietary/exclusive merchandise. 
 Our merchants purchase products from approximately 1,100 vendors. One of our vendors accounted for approximately seven percent of our total purchases during 2017. We buy a majority of our merchandise at the same time and from many of the same manufacturers as traditional department/specialty stores, however we generally do not require the same level of front and back-end vendor concessions, such as advertising allowances, return privileges and markdown allowances, which are common and significant in the department store industry. As a result, we believe that our buyers are able to negotiate more favorable upfront pricing terms from our vendors. We also purchase merchandise opportunistically when we believe a combination of the product and the price makes it a compelling addition to our assortment. In both instances, we pass our savings on to our customers through everyday low pricing targeted to be competitive with off-price retail chains.

Commissions from this leased department are included in Net sales reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

LOCATIONS AND STORE APPEARANCE 
 On February 3, 2018, we operated 293 stores in 31 states and an e-commerce retail selling site. Our stores are located in the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, Texas and the Southwest. We are most fully concentrated in the Southeast and Texas where 191 of our stores are located. Most locations are in neighborhood, community and regional shopping centers frequented by a more affluent customer. Our optimal co-tenants within these shopping centers cater to a similar target customer and include highly-frequented retail formats such as other apparel retailers, higher-end grocers and restaurants. All Stein Mart locations, including the corporate headquarters and distribution centers, are leased. 
 We selectively seek additional store locations that strengthen our portfolio in current as well as new markets. We utilize regional tenant representative brokers to help us identify potential sites for new or relocated stores. New and relocated store decisions are supported by independent sales forecasts, and are approved by a real estate committee made up of senior-level executives. 
 Our typical new store is approximately 32,000 gross square feet. They have a racetrack design, conveniently centralized check-out and individual dressing rooms. We display merchandise in lifestyle groupings of apparel and accessories, which we believe enables our customers to locate desired merchandise in a manner that encourages multiple purchases. We seek to create excitement in our stores through the continual flow of fashion merchandise, targeted sales promotions, store layout, merchandise presentation and the quality, value and depth of our merchandise assortment. 
 E-COMMERCE
We sell merchandise offerings on our website at www.steinmart.com. The website allows customers to make online purchases of many of the same products offered in our stores along with some exclusive online products. The website also provides information for customers regarding store locations, brands, products and selected sales promotion activity. Visitors to our website may apply for our credit card, sign up to be Preferred Customers, sign up for email notifications and purchase gift cards. E-commerce sales amounted to approximately 2.9 percent, 2.1 percent and 1.7 percent of our total sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our e-commerce software and warehouse distribution are managed by two third-party providers and, in some cases, our vendors ship directly to customers on our behalf. 
 CUSTOMER SERVICE 
 Our stores offer many services typically found in better department or specialty stores, such as merchandise locator services, a Preferred Customer program, co-branded and private label credit card programs and electronic gift cards. Each store is staffed with a number of sales associates to provide on-demand customer service. 
 MARKETING 
 Our marketing efforts are focused on deepening our relationship with our best customers in order to increase our share of her spending as well as seeking new customers. We engage in periodic market research, including customer surveys, to identify how best to reach each of these audiences and, in consultation with our outside advertising, media planning and direct-marketing agencies, we adjust our marketing focus accordingly. 
 Our advertising communicates brand-name fashion at a value price. We utilize a combination of full-color newspaper inserts, direct mail, newspaper run of press advertising and email to distribute our sales promotion messages. To reach a

 broader audience, increase brand awareness and drive promotional events, we use both television and radio advertising. We utilize digital media, primarily paid search, paid social, affiliate marketing and display advertising to increase brand awareness and drive traffic to our e-commerce site. We also use social networking sites, including Facebook, Twitter and various blogs. 
 Our Preferred Customer Card Program is an important marketing tool. Preferred Customer Card Program customers receive direct mail promoting key events, members-only shopping days, birthday discounts and special email announcements. This program provides useful database information regarding customer preferences, habits and advertising receptivity. All Stein Mart Credit Card holders are members of our Preferred Customer Card Program. 
 STEIN MART CREDIT CARDS 
 Stein Mart has both co-branded MasterCard and Private Label Credit Cards (together Stein Mart Credit Cards) available for our customers based on credit approvals. These cards are issued by our business partner, Synchrony Financial (Synchrony), who bears all credit risk associated with the cards. Synchrony provides us certain direct financial benefits based on sales on the cards and other factors. 
 As mentioned above, Stein Mart Credit Card holders receive advance notice of sales events and special promotional offers including Extra Savings Events which occur periodically throughout the year and provide incremental savings on purchases made with the Stein Mart Credit Card during these events. Stein Mart Credit Card holders also participate in the credit card rewards program, which provides for an incentive in the form of reward certificates based on their cumulative points earned for purchases made on the Stein Mart Credit Cards. 
 We launched a new program in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 with improved benefits built around our new Elite Stein Mart Credit Cards, which are given to our customers who charge more than $500 on their Stein Mart Credit Cards in a year. Under the new program, all Stein Mart Credit Cards now receive points and Elite card holders will receive double points on all purchases, which accumulate until a reward certificate is earned. Elite card holders also receive free shipping on purchases made at www.steinmart.com.
The program is designed to increase customer loyalty and sales as studies have shown that store-branded card holders spend 35 percent more than non-card holders. We also believe that the enhanced program will continue to grow our Stein Mart Credit Card penetration which gives us improved economics. 
 COMPETITION 
 We operate in an intensely competitive retail industry. Our primary competitors for both our stores and e-commerce are department and specialty stores, as well as conventional off-price retail chains. From our customers perspective, we believe that we differentiate ourselves from department and specialty stores with our (i) lower initial pricing, (ii) convenient locations in shopping centers and (iii) assortments that are more selective than department stores and more varied than specialty stores. We also believe that we differentiate ourselves from typical off-price retail chains by offering (i) primarily current season first-quality merchandise carried by better department or specialty stores, (ii) a stronger merchandising statement, consistently offering more depth of color and size in individual stock-keeping units, (iii) merchandise presentation and customer service more comparable to upscale retailers and (iv) competitive price levels. 
DISTRIBUTION 
 Our logistics network consists of consolidation centers (CCs) located in the Atlanta, Los Angeles and New Jersey areas, and store distribution centers (SDCs) located in the Atlanta, Dallas and Los Angeles areas. Approximately 55 percent of the vendor shipments are aggregated at the CCs and then shipped to the SDCs with the remaining 45 percent moving directly from vendors to SDCs. The SDCs receive, check and prepare the merchandise to ensure it is floor ready for our stores. The SDCs are automated and virtually all of our vendors are electronic data interchange (EDI) capable so we are able to cross-dock a high percentage of our receipts. Store deliveries are made by contract carriers once or twice a week, depending on location and store volume. The New Jersey CC is the only facility managed by a third-party logistics provider. 
EMPLOYEES 
 As of February 3, 2018, our workforce consisted of approximately 10,200 employees (equivalent to 5,400 40-hour employees). Each of our stores employs an average of 33 persons. The number of employees fluctuates during the year based on the particular selling season. We have no employees subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are generally good.

SEASONALITY 
 Our business is seasonal in nature. Sales and profitability are historically higher in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year, which include the spring and holiday seasons. 
TRADEMARKS 
 We own the federally registered trademark Stein Mart®, together with a number of other marks used in conjunction with our private label merchandise program. We believe that our trademarks are important, but, with the exception of Stein Mart®, not critical to our merchandising strategy.
