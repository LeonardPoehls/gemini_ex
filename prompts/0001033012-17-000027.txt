ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Where we say "we," "us," "our," the "Company" or "Flagstar," we usually mean Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. However, in some cases, a reference to "we," "us," "our," the "Company" or "Flagstar" will include our wholly-owned subsidiary Flagstar Bank, FSB (the "Bank").
General
We are a Michigan-based savings and loan holding company founded in 1993. Our business is primarily conducted through our principal subsidiary, the Bank, a federally chartered stock savings bank founded in 1987. Based on our assets at December 31, 2016, we are one of the largest banks headquartered in Michigan, providing commercial, small business, and consumer banking services. At December 31, 2016, we had 2,886 full-time equivalent employees inclusive of account executives and loan officers. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol "FBC." We are considered a controlled company for NYSE purposes, because MP Thrift Investments, L.P. held approximately 62.6 percent of our common stock as of December 31, 2016.
Our banking network emphasizes the delivery of a complete set of banking and mortgage products and services and we distinguish ourselves by crafting specialized solutions for our customers, local delivery, customer service and product pricing. At December 31, 2016, we operated 99 full services banking branches throughout Michigan's major markets where we offer full set of banking products to consumer, commercial, and government customers within those markets. 
We have a unique, relationship-based business model of a leading Michigan-based bank leveraging a national mortgage business which, itself, leverages the bank. We believe our strong position and focus on service creates a significant competitive advantage in the markets in which we compete. The disciplined management team we have assembled is focused on developing substantial and attractive growth opportunities that generate profitable operations with significant operating leverage. We believe our lower risk profile and strong capital level positions us to better exploit the opportunities that our business model yields and deliver attractive shareholder returns over the long term.
We are a national mortgage originator and utilize multiple origination channels including correspondent, broker, distributed retail, and direct to consumer. We also service and subservice mortgage loans for others on a fee for service basis and may also collect ancillary fees, such as late fees and earn income through the use of noninterest bearing escrow deposits. These escrow deposit accounts and amounts received from servicing loans generate company controlled deposits which offer a stable, low cost, long-term source of funding.
Operating Segments
Our operations are conducted through four operating segments: Community Banking, Mortgage Originations, Mortgage Servicing, and Other. For financial information and additional details regarding each of these operating segments, please see MD&A â€“ Operating Segments and Note 23 - Segment Information, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Community Banking
Our Community Banking segment, services consumer, governmental and commercial customers in the major Michigan markets we serve. We also serve home builders, correspondents, and commercial customers on a national level. We are focused on using capital and liquidity generated from the mortgage business to expand our community banking relationships and build enduring net interest margin revenue and fee income.
Our commercial customers are from a broad range of industries including financial, insurance, service, manufacturing, and distribution. We offer financial products to these customers for use in their normal business operations and financing of working capital needs, equipment purchases and other capital investments. Additionally, our commercial real estate division supports income producing real estate properties. These loans are made to finance properties such as owner-occupied, retail, office, multi-family apartment buildings, industrial buildings, and residential developments which are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale, or refinance of the property.

In 2016, we launched a national home builder finance program to grow our balance sheet, increase commercial deposits and develop incremental revenue through our retail purchase mortgage channel and we expanded our product offerings by entering the equipment finance and leasing market. 
Mortgage Origination
We utilize multiple production channels to originate or acquire mortgage loans on a national scale to generate high returns on equity capital. This helps grow the servicing business and provides stable, low cost funding for the community bank. We continue to leverage technology to streamline the mortgage origination process, thereby bringing service and convenience to borrowers and correspondents. We also continue to make available to our customers various web-based tools that facilitate the mortgage loan process through each of our production channels. We will continue to seek new ways to expand our relationships with borrowers and correspondents to provide the necessary capital and liquidity to grow mortgage servicing and the community bank.
Correspondent. In the correspondent channels, an unaffiliated bank or mortgage company completes the loan paperwork and also funds the loan at closing. After the bank or mortgage company has funded the transaction, we purchase the loan at an agreed upon price. We perform a full review of each loan, whether purchased in bulk or not, purchasing only those loans that were originated in accordance with our underwriting guidelines. Correspondents apply to the Bank and may be approved for delegated underwriting authority. Delegate correspondents assume the risks associated with the underwriting of the loan and earn more on loans sold compared to non-delegated correspondents. Non-delegated correspondents earn commissions and administrative fees for closing and funding loans which are then underwritten by the Bank. We have active correspondent relationships with 739 companies located in all 50 states.
Broker. In a broker transaction, an unaffiliated mortgage broker completes several steps of the loan origination process including the loan paperwork, but the loans are underwritten by us on a loan-level basis to our underwriting standards and we fund and close the loan in the Bank's name, thereby becoming the lender of record. Currently, we have active broker relationships with 615 mortgage brokers located in all 50 states.
Retail. In our retail channel, loans are originated through our nationwide network of stand-alone home loan centers. At December 31, 2016, we maintained 41 retail locations in 21 states. In a direct-to-consumer lending transaction, loans are originated through our Community Banking segment banking centers and from a national direct-to-consumer call center, both of which, may leverage our existing customer relationships. When loans are originated on a retail basis, most aspects of the lending process are completed internally, including the origination documentation (inclusive of customer disclosures), as well as the funding of the transactions. Our centralized loan processing provides efficiencies and allows lending sales staff to focus on business development.
The majority of our total loan originations during the year ended December 31, 2016 represented mortgage loans that were collateralized by residential first mortgages on single-family residences and were eligible for sale to the Agencies. In addition, we originate or purchase residential first mortgage loans, other consumer loans, and commercial loans for our HFI loan portfolios. Our revenues include noninterest income from sales of residential first mortgages to the Agencies, net interest income, and revenue from servicing of loans for others. 
Our mortgage origination segment provides us with a large number of customer relationships through our servicing of loans sold to the Agencies and those loans we retain. These relationships, along with our banking customer relationships, provide us an opportunity to cross-sell a full line of consumer financial products which include mortgage refinancing, HELOC, and other consumer loans.
We primarily utilize borrowings from the FHLB to fund our mortgage loans held for sale and our warehouse lending portfolio. The FHLB provides funding on a fully collateralized basis to us. Our borrowing capacity with the FHLB is a function of the amount of eligible collateral pledged, which includes residential first mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, commercial real estate loans. 
Competition
We face substantial competition in attracting deposits and making loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from other savings banks, commercial banks and credit unions in our local market areas. Money market funds and full-service securities brokerage firms also compete with us for these funds and, in recent years, many financial institutions have competed for deposits through the Internet. We compete for deposits by offering a broad range of high quality customized 
6

banking services at a large number of convenient locations where our customers are served at a desk rather than in a teller line. We also compete by offering competitive interest rates on our deposit products.
From a lending perspective, there are a large number of institutions offering mortgage loans, consumer loans and commercial loans, including many mortgage lenders that operate on a national scale, as well as local savings banks, commercial banks, and other lenders. With respect to those products that we offer, we compete by offering competitive interest rates, fees, and other loan terms, banking products and services and by offering efficient and rapid service.
Subsidiaries
At December 31, 2016, our corporate legal structure consisted of the Bank and its wholly-owned subsidiaries along with our wholly-owned non-bank subsidiaries and captive insurance company through which we conduct other non-material business or which are inactive. The Bank and its wholly owned subsidiaries comprised 99.5 percent of our total assets at December 31, 2016. Currently, we also own nine statutory trusts that are not consolidated with our operations. For additional information, see Notes 1, 7 and 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Regulation and Supervision
We, the Bank and the products and services we offer, are subject to regulation under state and federal laws. Regulatory reform and enhanced supervisory requirements have had and could continue to have an impact on how we conduct business. As a result, we continually assess the impact of regulatory changes and implement policies, processes and controls required to comply with new regulations.
Changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies, cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results. For more information, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, herein.
Consent Orders and Supervisory Agreements
Consent Order with OCC.    On December 19, 2016, the OCC terminated its Consent Order with the Bank which had been in effect since October 23, 2012. Since entering into the Consent Order, the Bank implemented and adopted, what we believe are, industry best practices related to, among other things, regulatory compliance, enterprise risk management, capital and liquidity. 
Supervisory Agreement. We are also subject to a Supervisory Agreement with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the "Supervisory Agreement"), dated January 27, 2010. A failure to comply with the Supervisory Agreement could result in the initiation of further enforcement action by the Federal Reserve, including the imposition of further operating restrictions, and could result in additional enforcement actions against the Company. The Company has taken actions which it believes are appropriate to comply with and intends to maintain compliance with all of the requirements of the Supervisory Agreement. For further information and a complete description of all of the terms of the Supervisory Agreement, please refer to the copy of the Supervisory Agreement filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 28, 2010 and included as an exhibit to this filing.
Consent Order with CFPB. On September 29, 2014, the Bank entered into a Consent Order with the CFPB. The Consent Order relates to alleged violations of federal consumer financial laws arising from the Bankâ€™s residential first mortgage loan loss mitigation practices and default servicing operations dating back to 2011. Under the terms of the Consent Order, the Bank has paid $28 million for borrower remediation and $10 million in civil money penalties. The settlement does not involve any admission of wrongdoing on the part of the Bank or its employees, directors, officers, or agents.
Holding Company Regulation
The Company is a savings and loan holding company regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the "Federal Reserve") and the SEC.
Acquisition, Activities and Change in Control. We are a unitary savings and loan holding company, as defined by federal banking law, as is our controlling stockholder, MP Thrift. We may only conduct, or acquire control of companies engaged in, activities permissible for a savings and loan holding company pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act and relevant regulations. Without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve, neither we, nor MP Thrift may: (i) acquire control of another savings association or holding company thereof, or acquire all or substantially 
7

all of the assets thereof; or (ii) acquire or retain, with certain exceptions, more than 5 percent of the voting shares of a non-subsidiary savings association or a non-subsidiary savings and loan holding company. We are prohibited from acquiring control of a depository institution that is not federally insured or retaining control of a savings association subsidiary for more than one year after the date that such subsidiary becomes uninsured. Similarly, we may not be acquired by a bank holding company, or any company, unless the Federal Reserve approves such transaction. In addition, the GLBA generally restricts a company from acquiring us if that company is engaged directly or indirectly in activities that are not permissible for a savings and loan holding company or financial holding company.
Limitation on Capital Distributions. Under the Supervisory Agreement, we may not declare or pay any cash dividends or other capital distributions or purchase, repurchase, or redeem, or commit to purchase, repurchase, or redeem any equity stock without the prior written non-objection of the Federal Reserve. The Company does not currently pay dividends on capital stock.
Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and/or sponsoring certain "covered funds," including hedge funds and private equity funds. The statutory provision is commonly called the "Volcker Rule." Pursuant to the requirements of the Volcker Rule, we have established a standard compliance program based on the size and complexity of our operations.

Basel III Capital Requirements. The Bank and the holding company are currently subject to the regulatory capital framework and guidelines reached by Basel III as adopted by the OCC and Federal Reserve. The OCC and Federal Reserve have risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to measure capital adequacy with regard to a banking organizationâ€™s balance sheet, including off-balance sheet exposures such as unused portions of loan commitments, letters of credit, and recourse arrangements. 
The Bank and Bank Holding Company have been subject to the capital requirements of the Basel III rules since January 1, 2015. Basel III replaces the framework established by the 1988 capital accord ("Basel I") of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. For additional information, see Note 20 - Regulatory Matters.
Stress Testing Requirements. The U.S. federal banking agencies, including the OCC and the Federal Reserve, issued final rules implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that require banking organizations, including savings associations and savings and loan holding companies, with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion to conduct annual company-run stress tests, report the results to their primary federal regulator and the Federal Reserve and publish a summary of the results. Each Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test ("DFAST") must be conducted using certain scenarios (baseline, adverse and severely adverse), which the OCC and Federal Reserve will publish by February 15 of each year. Banking organizations are required to use the scenarios to calculate, for each quarter-end within a nine-quarter planning horizon, the impact of such scenarios on revenues, losses, loan loss reserves and regulatory capital levels and ratios, taking into account all relevant exposures and activities. The rules also require each banking organization to establish and maintain a system of controls, oversight and documentation, including policies and procedures, designed to ensure that the DFAST procedures used by the banking organization are effective in meeting the requirements of the rules.
Durbin Amendment. The Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act alters the competitive structure of the debit card payment processing industry and caps debit card interchange fees for banks with over $10 billion in assets. The final rule establishes standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions. Under the final rule, the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction will be the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. The impact of this amendment was approximately $2 million in for year ended December 31, 2016 and is estimated to be $4 million on an annual basis.
Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the Federal Reserveâ€™s "source of strength" doctrine and extended it to savings and loan holding companies. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the prudential regulatory agencies are required to promulgate joint rules requiring bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength for any depository institution subsidiary by maintaining the ability to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event that it suffers financial distress.
Banking Regulation
We must comply with a wide variety of banking, consumer protection and securities laws, regulations and supervisory expectations and are regulated by multiple regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

FDIC Insurance and Assessment. The FDIC insures the deposits of the Bank and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government through the DIF. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing each financial institution an insurance premium. The FDIC defined deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution is equal to the average consolidated total assets during the assessment period, minus average tangible equity.
Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC implemented a new surcharge on large bank participants with more than $10 billion in assets and simultaneously reduced the base assessment rates. The new surcharge and lower assessment are not expected to have a material impact on our earnings.
All FDIC-insured financial institutions must pay an annual assessment to provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation ("FICO bonds"), a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the Federal Housing Finance Board. 
Affiliate Transaction Restrictions. The Bank is subject to the affiliate and insider transaction rules applicable to member banks of the Federal Reserve as well as additional limitations imposed by the OCC. These provisions prohibit or limit the Bank from extending credit to, or entering into certain transactions with principal stockholders, directors and executive officers of the banking institution and certain of its affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed further restrictions on transactions with certain affiliates and extension of credit to executive officers, directors and principal stockholders.
Limitation on Capital Distributions. The OCC regulates all capital distributions made by the Bank, directly or indirectly, to the holding company, including dividend payments. As a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, the Bank must file a notice and receive approval from the OCC at least 30 days prior to each proposed capital distribution before declaring any dividends. Additionally, the Bank may not pay dividends to the Bancorp if, after paying those dividends, the Bank would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk-based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements. Payment of dividends by the Bank also may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the OCC if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice.
Loans to One Borrower. Under the Home Owners Loan Act ("HOLA"), savings associations are generally subject to the national bank limits on loans to one borrower. Generally, savings associations may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15 percent of the institutionâ€™s unimpaired capital and surplus (as defined by HOLA). Additional amounts may be loaned if such loans or extensions of credit are secured by readily-marketable collateral, but in no case may they be in excess of an additional 10 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus. The Bank has established an internal lending threshold that is more conservative than the limits required by HOLA and has a defined tracking and reporting process to monitor lending levels of concentration. 
CFPB and Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations
The Bank is subject to a number of federal consumer protection laws and regulations. These include, among others, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, electronic funds transfer laws, redlining laws, predatory lending laws, laws prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, or sale of consumer financial products or    services, and the Gramm Leach Bliley Act regarding customer privacy and data security.

In addition to supervision by the OCC, the Bank is also subject to supervision by the CFPB, which has responsibility    for enforcing the principal federal consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity    Act, and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Truth in Savings Act, among others, for institutions that have assets in    excess of $10 billion. Much of the CFPBâ€™s regulatory efforts have addressed mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards,    and appraisal and escrow standards. These laws include the Homeowners Protection Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,    the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act, and the Real    Estate Settlement Procedures Act.
Incentive Compensation
The U.S. bank regulatory agencies issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of U.S. banks do not undermine the safety and soundness of such banks by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The U.S. bank regulatory agencies review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of U.S. banks that are not "large, complex banking organizations." These 
9

reviews are tailored to each bank based on the scope and complexity of the bankâ€™s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. 
Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering
The Bank is subject to the BSA and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act. The BSA requires all financial institutions to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes various record keeping and reporting requirements such as cash transaction and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence requirements. The Bank is also required to comply with U.S. Treasuryâ€™s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, individuals, entities and others.
