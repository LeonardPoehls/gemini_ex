Item 1. Business.
 
We are a diversified energy limited partnership formed in Delaware that is focused on coal and energy related assets and activities, including energy infrastructure investments. We produce, process and sell high quality coal of various steam and metallurgical grades from multiple coal producing basins in the United States. We market our steam coal primarily to electric utility companies as fuel for their steam powered generators. Customers for our metallurgical coal are primarily steel and coke producers who use our coal to produce coke, which is used as a raw material in the steel manufacturing process. Our business includes investments in joint ventures to provide for the transportation of hydrocarbons and drilling support services in the Utica Shale region. We have also invested in joint ventures that provide sand for fracking operations to drillers in the Utica Shale region and other oil and natural gas basins in the United States.
 
We have a geographically diverse asset base with coal reserves located in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Western Bituminous region. As of December 31, 2016, we controlled an estimated 256.9 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves, consisting of an estimated 203.5 million tons of steam coal and an estimated 53.4 million tons of metallurgical coal. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we controlled an estimated 196.5 million tons of non-reserve coal deposits. Both our estimated proven and probable coal reserves and non-reserve coal deposits as of December 31, 2016 decreased when compared to the estimated tons and deposits reported as of December 31, 2015 due to the sale of our Elk Horn coal leasing business in August 2016. As part of the recent audits of our coal reserves and deposits performed by Marshall Miller & Associates, Inc., this outside expert performed an independent pro forma economic analysis using industry-accepted guidelines and this was used, in part, to classify tonnage as either proven and probable coal reserves or non-reserve coal deposits, based on current market conditions.
 
We operate underground and surface mines located in Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Utah. The number of mines that we operate will vary from time to time depending on a number of factors, including the existing demand for and price of coal, depletion of economically recoverable reserves and availability of experienced labor. In the third quarter of 2015, we temporarily idled a majority of our Central Appalachia operations due to ongoing weak coal market conditions for met and steam coal produced from this region. We resumed mining operations at all of our Central Appalachia operations in 2016 to fulfill customer contracts that we secured for 2016 and 2017.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we produced and sold approximately 3.3 million tons of coal.
 
Our principal business strategy is to safely, efficiently and profitably produce and sell both steam and metallurgical coal from our diverse asset base in order to resume, and, over time, increase our quarterly cash distributions. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to expand and diversify our operations through strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition of long-term, cash generating natural resource assets. We believe that such assets will allow us to grow our cash available for distribution and enhance stability of our cash flow.

Current Liquidity and Outlook
 
As of December 31, 2016, our available liquidity was $13.0 million, including cash on hand of $0.1 million and $12.9 million available under our amended and restated credit agreement. On May 13, 2016, we entered into a fifth amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) of our amended and restated agreement that initially extended the term of the senior secured credit facility to July 31, 2017. Per the Fifth Amendment, the term of the credit facility automatically extended to December 31, 2017 when the revolving credit commitments were reduced to $55 million or less as of December 31, 2016. The Fifth Amendment also immediately reduced the revolving credit commitments under the credit facility to a maximum of $75 million and maintains the amount available for letters of credit at $30 million. As of December 31, 2016, we met the requirements to extend the maturity date of the credit facility to December 31, 2017. In December 2016, we entered into a seventh amendment of our amended and restated credit agreement (the “Seventh Amendment”). The Seventh Amendment immediately reduces the revolving credit commitments by $11.0 million and provides for additional revolving credit commitment reductions of $2.0 million each on June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017. The Seventh Amendment further reduces the revolving credit commitments over time on a dollar-for-dollar basis for the net cash proceeds received from any asset sales after the Seventh Amendment date once the aggregate net cash proceeds received exceeds $2.0 million. For more information about our amended and restated credit agreement, please read “Part 1, Item 1— Recent Developments-Amendments to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.”
 
Since the current maturity date of our credit facility is December 31, 2017, we are unable to demonstrate that we have sufficient liquidity to operate our business over the next twelve months from the date of filing our Annual Report on Form 10-K and thus substantial doubt is raised about our ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, our independent registered public accounting firm has included an emphasis paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. The presence of the going concern emphasis paragraph in our auditors’ report may have an adverse impact on our relationship with third parties with whom we do business, including our customers, vendors, lenders and employees, making it difficult to raise additional debt or equity financing to the extent needed and conduct normal operations. As a result, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected.
 
Since our credit facility has an expiration date of December 2017, we determined that our credit facility debt liability of $10.0 million at December 31, 2016 should be classified as a current liability on our consolidated statements of financial position. The classification of our credit facility balance as a current liability raises substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. We are considering alternative financing options that could result in a new long-term credit facility. However, we may be unable to complete such a transaction on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to extend the expiration date of our credit facility, we will have to secure alternative financing to replace our credit facility by the expiration date of December 2017 in order to continue our business operations. If we are unable to extend the expiration date of our credit facility or secure a replacement facility, we will lose a primary source of liquidity, and we may not be able to generate adequate cash flow from operations to fund our business, including amounts that may become due under our credit facility. Furthermore, although met coal prices and demand have improved in recent months, if weak demand and low prices for steam coal persist and if met coal prices and demand weaken, we may not be able to continue to give the required representations or meet all of the covenants and restrictions included in our credit facility. If we violate any of the covenants or restrictions in our amended and restated credit agreement, including the maximum leverage ratio, some or all of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable, and our lenders’ commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. If we are unable to give a required representation or we violate a covenant or restriction, then we will need a waiver from our lenders in order to continue to borrow under our amended and restated credit agreement. Although we believe our lenders loans are well secured under the terms of our amended and restated credit agreement, there is no assurance that the lenders would agree to any such waiver. Failure to obtain financing or to generate sufficient cash flow from operations could cause us to further curtail our operations and reduce our spending and to alter our business plan. We may also be required to consider other options, such as selling additional assets or merger opportunities, and depending on the urgency of our liquidity constraints, we may be required to pursue such an option at an inopportune time. If we are not able to fund our liquidity requirements for the next twelve months, we may not be able to continue as a going concern. For more information about our liquidity and our credit facility, please read “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
 
We continue to take measures, including the suspension of cash distributions on our common and subordinated units and cost and productivity improvements, to enhance and preserve our liquidity so that we can fund our ongoing operations and necessary capital expenditures and meet our financial commitments and debt service obligations.

Recent Developments
 
Sale of our General Partner by Wexford 
 
On January 21, 2016 and March 17, 2016, Royal Energy Resources, Inc. (“Royal”) acquired from Wexford Capital LP (“Wexford Capital” and together with certain of its affiliates and principals, “Wexford”) all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of our general partner, 676,912 of our issued and outstanding common units and 945,525 issued and outstanding subordinated units. Royal is a publicly traded company listed on the OTC market (OTCQB: ROYE) and is focused on the acquisition of coal, natural gas and renewable energy assets that are profitable at current distressed prices. Immediately subsequent to the consummation of the transaction, the following members of the board of directors of our general partner tendered their resignations effective immediately: Mark Zand, Philip Braunstein, Ken Rubin, Arthur Amron, Douglas Lambert and Mark Plaumann. As the owner of our general partner, Royal has the right to appoint the members of the board of directors of our general partner and so appointed the following individuals as new directors to fill the vacancies resulting from the resignations: William Tuorto, Ronald Phillips, Michael Thompson, Ian Ganzer (who subsequently resigned in September 2016), Douglas Holsted, Brian Hughs and David Hanig.
 
On March 21, 2016, we and Royal entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which we issued 6,000,000 of our common units to Royal in a private placement at $1.50 per common unit for an aggregate purchase price of $9.0 million. Royal paid us $2.0 million in cash and delivered a promissory note payable to us in the amount of $7.0 million (the “Rhino Promissory Note”). On May 13, 2016 and September 30, 2016, Royal paid us $3.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, on the promissory note. The final installment on the promissory note of $2.0 million was due on or before December 31, 2016. However, on December 30, 2016, we modified the Securities Purchase Agreement with Royal to extend the due date of the final $2.0 million payment to December 31, 2018. Please read “—Letter Agreement Regarding Rhino Promissory Note and Weston Promissory Note.” In the event the disinterested members of the board of directors of our general partner determine that we do not need the capital that would be provided by the final installment, we have the option to rescind Royal’s purchase of 1,333,333 common units and the applicable installment will not be payable (each, a “Rescission Right”). If we fail to exercise a Rescission Right, we have the option to repurchase 1,333,333 of our common units at $3.00 per common unit from Royal (each, a “Repurchase Option”). The Repurchase Option terminates on December 31, 2017. Royal’s obligation to pay any installment of the promissory note is subject to certain conditions, including that we have entered into an agreement to extend the amended and restated credit agreement, as amended, to a date no sooner than December 31, 2017. In the event such conditions are not satisfied as of the installment due date, Royal has the right to cancel the remaining unpaid balance of the promissory note in exchange for the surrender of such number of common units equal to the principal balance of the promissory note divided by $1.50.
 
Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, on March 21, 2016, we and Royal entered into a registration rights agreement. The registration rights agreement grants Royal piggyback registration rights under certain circumstances with respect to the common units issued to Royal pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement.
 
Option Agreement
 
On December 30, 2016, we entered into an option agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with Royal, Rhino Resources Partners Holdings, LLC (“Rhino Holdings”), an entity wholly owned by certain investment partnerships managed by Yorktown Partners LLC (“Yorktown”), and our general partner. Upon execution of the Option Agreement, we received an option (the “Call Option”) from Rhino Holdings to acquire substantially all of the outstanding common stock of Armstrong Energy, Inc. (“Armstrong Energy”) that is owned by investment partnerships managed by Yorktown, representing approximately 97% of the outstanding common stock of Armstrong Energy. Armstrong Energy, Inc. is a coal producing company with approximately 554 million tons of proven and probable reserves and six mines located in the Illinois Basin in western Kentucky as of September 30, 2016. The Option Agreement stipulates that we can exercise the Call Option no earlier than January 1, 2018 and no later than December 31, 2019. In exchange for Rhino Holdings granting us the Call Option, we issued 5.0 million common units, representing limited partner interests in us (the “Call Option Premium Units”) to Rhino Holdings upon the execution of the Option Agreement. The Option Agreement stipulates we can exercise the Call Option and purchase the common stock of Armstrong Energy in exchange for a number of common units to be issued to Rhino Holdings, which when added with the Call Option Premium Units, will result in Rhino Holdings owning 51% of the fully diluted common units of us. The purchase of Armstrong Energy through the exercise of the Call Option would also require Royal to transfer a 51% ownership interest in our general partner to Rhino Holdings. Our ability to exercise the Call Option is conditioned upon (i) sixty (60) days having passed since the entry by Armstrong Energy into an agreement with its bondholders to restructure its bonds and (ii) the amendment of our revolving credit facility to permit the acquisition of Armstrong Energy.
 
The Option Agreement also contains an option (the “Put Option”) granted by us to Rhino Holdings whereby Rhino Holdings has the right, but not the obligation, to cause us to purchase substantially all of the outstanding common stock of Armstrong Energy from Rhino Holdings under the same terms and conditions discussed above for the Call Option. The exercise of the Put Option is dependent upon (i) the entry by Armstrong Energy into an agreement with its bondholders to restructure its bonds and (ii) the termination and repayment of any outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility.

The Option Agreement contains customary covenants, representations and warranties and indemnification obligations for losses arising from the inaccuracy of representations or warranties or breaches of covenants contained in the Option Agreement, the Seventh Amendment (defined below) and the GP Amendment (defined below). Upon the request by Rhino Holdings, we will also enter into a registration rights agreement that provides Rhino Holdings with the right to demand two shelf registration statements and registration statements on Form S-1, as well as piggyback registration rights for as long as Rhino Holdings owns at least 10% of the outstanding common units.
 
Pursuant to the Option Agreement, the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of our general partner was amended (“GP Amendment”). Pursuant to the GP Amendment, Mr. Bryan H. Lawrence was appointed to the board of directors of our general partner as a designee of Rhino Holdings and Rhino Holdings has the right to appoint an additional independent director. Rhino Holdings has the right to appoint two members to the board of our general partner for as long as it continues to own 20% of the common units on an undiluted basis. The GP Amendment also provided Rhino Holdings with the authority to consent to any delegation of authority to any committee of the board of our general partner. Upon the exercise of the Call Option or the Put Option, the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of or general partner, as amended, will be further amended to provide that Royal and Rhino Holdings will each have the ability to appoint three directors and that the remaining director will be the chief executive officer of our general partner unless agreed otherwise.
 
The Option Agreement superseded and terminated the equity exchange agreement entered into on September 30, 2016 by and among Royal, Rhino Holdings, an entity wholly owned by certain investment partnerships managed by Yorktown, and our general partner.
 
Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement
 
On December 30, 2016, we entered into a Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement (the “Preferred Unit Agreement”) with Weston Energy LLC (“Weston”), an entity wholly owned by certain investment partnerships managed by Yorktown, and Royal. Under the Preferred Unit Agreement, Weston and Royal agreed to purchase 1,300,000 and 200,000, respectively, of Series A preferred units representing limited partner interests in us at a price of $10.00 per Series A preferred unit. The Series A preferred units have the preferences, rights and obligations set forth in our Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, which is described below. In exchange for the Series A preferred units, Weston and Royal paid cash of $11.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, to us and Weston assigned to us a $2.0 million note receivable from Royal originally dated September 30, 2016 (the “Weston Promissory Note”). Please read “—Letter Agreement Regarding Rhino Promissory Note and Weston Promissory Note.”
 
The Preferred Unit Agreement contains customary representations, warrants and covenants, which include among other things, that, for as long as the Series A preferred units are outstanding, we will cause CAM Mining, LLC, one of our subsidiaries, (“CAM Mining”) to conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and use reasonable best efforts to maintain and preserve intact its current organization, business and franchise and to preserve the rights, franchises, goodwill and relationships of its employees, customers, lenders, suppliers, regulators and others having business relationships with CAM Mining.
 
The Preferred Unit Agreement stipulates that upon the request of the holder of the majority of our common units following their conversion from Series A preferred units, as outlined in our partnership agreement, we will enter into a registration rights agreement with such holder. Such majority holder has the right to demand two shelf registration statements and registration statements on Form S-1, as well as piggyback registration rights.
 
On January 27, 2017, Royal sold 100,000 of its Series A preferred units to Weston and its other 100,000 Series A preferred units to another third party.

Letter Agreement Regarding Rhino Promissory Note and Weston Promissory Note
 
On December 30, 2016, we entered into a letter agreement with Royal whereby the maturity dates of the Weston Promissory Note and the final installment payment of the Rhino Promissory Note were extended to December 31, 2018. The letter agreement further provides that the aggregate $4.0 million balance of the Weston Promissory Note and Rhino Promissory Note may be converted at Royal’s option into a number of shares of Royal’s common stock equal to the outstanding balance multiplied by seventy-five percent (75%) of the volume-weighted average closing price of Royal’s common stock for the 90 days preceding the date of conversion (“Royal VWAP”), subject to a minimum Royal VWAP of $3.50 and a maximum Royal VWAP of $7.50.
Fourth Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement of Limited Partnership 
 
On December 30, 2016, our general partner amended our partnership agreement to create, authorize and issue the Series A preferred units. The Series A preferred units are a new class of equity security that rank senior to all classes or series of our equity securities with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation. The holders of the Series A preferred units shall be entitled to receive annual distributions equal to the greater of (i) 50% of the CAM Mining free cash flow (as defined below) and (ii) an amount equal to the number of outstanding Series A preferred units multiplied by $0.80. “CAM Mining free cash flow” is defined in our partnership agreement as (i) the total revenue of our Central Appalachia business segment, minus (ii) the cost of operations (exclusive of depreciation, depletion and amortization) for our Central Appalachia business segment, minus (iii) an amount equal to $6.50, multiplied by the aggregate number of met coal and steam coal tons sold by us from our Central Appalachia business segment. If we fail to pay any or all of the distributions in respect of the Series A preferred units, such deficiency will accrue until paid in full and we will not be permitted to pay any distributions on our partnership interests that rank junior to the Series A preferred units, including our common units. The Series A preferred units will be liquidated in accordance with their capital accounts and upon liquidation will be entitled to distributions of property and cash in accordance with the balances of their capital accounts prior to such distributions to equity securities that rank junior to the Series A preferred units.
 
The Series A preferred units will vote on an as-converted basis with the common units, and we will be restricted from taking certain actions without the consent of the holders of a majority of the Series A preferred units, including: (i) the issuance of additional Series A preferred units, or securities that rank senior or equal to the Series A preferred units; (ii) the sale or transfer of CAM Mining or a material portion of its assets; (iii) the repurchase of common units, or the issuance of rights or warrants to holders of common units entitling them to purchase common units at less than fair market value; (iv) consummation of a spin off; (v) the incurrence, assumption or guaranty indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of $50.0 million except indebtedness relating to entities or assets that are acquired by us or our affiliates that is in existence at the time of such acquisition or (vi) the modification of CAM Mining’s accounting principles or the financial or operational reporting principles of our Central Appalachia business segment, subject to certain exceptions.
 
Elk Horn Coal Leasing Disposition
 
In August 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our Elk Horn coal leasing company to a third party for total cash consideration of $12.0 million. We received $10.5 million in cash consideration upon the closing of the Elk Horn transaction and the remaining $1.5 million of consideration will be paid in ten equal monthly installments of $150,000 on the 20th of each calendar month beginning on September 20, 2016. Elk Horn is a coal leasing company located in eastern Kentucky that provided us with coal royalty revenues from coal properties owned by Elk Horn and leased to third-party operators. As of December 31, 2015, Elk Horn controlled approximately 100 million tons of proven and probable steam coal reserves. During the second quarter of 2016, we evaluated the Elk Horn assets for potential impairment based upon the initial purchase price offered by the buyer and the continued deterioration of the Central Appalachia steam coal markets that had adversely affected Elk Horn’s financial results. Our impairment analysis determined that a potential impairment existed since the carrying amount of the Elk Horn long-lived asset group exceeded the cash flows that would be generated from the purchase price offered from the buyer. Based on a market approach used to estimate the fair value of the Elk Horn long-lived asset group, we recorded total asset impairment charges of approximately $118.7 million related to coal properties as of June 30, 2016. The disposal of the Elk Horn assets and liabilities in August 2016 resulted in an additional loss of $1.2 million. The total loss of $119.9 million from the Elk Horn disposal is recorded as discontinued operations along with the previous operating results of Elk Horn that have been reclassified for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Amended and Restated Credit Agreement Amendments
 
On March 17, 2016, our operating company, as borrower, and we and certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) of our amended and restated credit agreement. The Fourth Amendment amended the definition of change of control in the amended and restated credit agreement to permit Royal to purchase the membership interests of our general partner.
 
On May 13, 2016, we entered into the Fifth Amendment of the amended and restated credit agreement , which extended the term to July 31, 2017.
 
In July 2016, we entered into a sixth amendment (the “Sixth Amendment”) of our amended and restated senior secured credit facility that permitted the sale of Elk Horn that was discussed earlier.
 
In December, 2016, we entered into the Seventh Amendment of our amended and restated credit agreement. The Seventh Amendment allows for the Series A preferred units discussed above. The Seventh Amendment immediately reduces the revolving credit commitments by $11.0 million and provides for additional revolving credit commitment reductions of $2.0 million each on June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017. A condition precedent to the effectiveness of the Seventh Amendment was the receipt of the $13.0 million of cash proceeds received by us from the issuance of the Series A preferred units discussed above, which was used to repay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Per the Seventh Amendment, the receipt of $13.0 million cash proceeds fulfills the required Royal equity contributions as outlined in the previous amendments to our credit agreement. (Please see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Amended and Restated Credit Agreement” for further details on the debt amendments).
 
Delisting of Common Units from NYSE
 
On December 17, 2015, the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) notified us that the NYSE had determined to commence proceedings to delist our common units from the NYSE as a result of our failure to comply with the continued listing standard set forth in Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual to maintain an average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period of at least $15 million for our common units. The NYSE also suspended the trading of our common units at the close of trading on December 17, 2015.
 
On January 4, 2016, we filed an appeal with the NYSE to review the suspension and delisting determination of our common units. The NYSE held a hearing regarding our appeal on April 20, 2016 and affirmed its prior decision to delist our common units.
 
On April 27, 2016, the NYSE filed with the SEC a notification of removal from listing and registration on Form 25 to delist our common units and terminate the registration of our common units under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The delisting became effective on May 9, 2016. Our common units trade on the OTCQB Marketplace under the ticker symbol “RHNO.”
 
We are exploring the possibility of listing our common units on the NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”), pending our capability to meet the NASDAQ initial listing standards.
 
Reverse Unit Split
 
On April 18, 2016, we completed a 1-for-10 reverse split on our common units and subordinated units. Pursuant to the reverse split, common unitholders received one common unit for every 10 common units owned on April 18, 2016 and subordinated unitholders received one subordinated unit for every 10 subordinated units owned on April 18, 2016. Any fractional units resulting from the reverse unit split were rounded to the nearest whole unit. The reverse unit split was intended to increase the market price per unit of our common units in order to comply with the NYSE’s continued listing standards.
Distribution Suspension
 
Beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2015 and continuing through the quarter ended December 31, 2016, we have suspended the cash distribution on our common units. For each of the quarters ended September 30, 2014, December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015, we announced cash distributions per common unit at levels lower than the minimum quarterly distribution. We have not paid any distribution on our subordinated units for any quarter after the quarter ended March 31, 2012. The distribution suspension and prior reductions were the result of prolonged weakness in the coal markets, which has continued to adversely affect our cash flow.

-


Pursuant to our partnership agreement, our common units accrue arrearages every quarter when the distribution level is below the minimum level of $4.45 per unit. Since our distributions for the quarters ended September 30, 2014, December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 were below the minimum level and we altogether suspended the distribution beginning with the quarters ended June 30, 2015 through December 31, 2016, we have accumulated arrearages at December 31, 2016 related to the common unit distribution of approximately $207.4 million.
 
History
 
Our predecessor was formed in April 2003 by Wexford Capital. We were formed in April 2010 to own and control the coal properties and related assets owned by Rhino Energy LLC. On October 5, 2010, we completed our IPO. Our common units were originally listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “RNO”. Please read “—Recent Developments—Delisting of Common Units from NYSE.” In connection with the IPO, Wexford contributed their membership interests in Rhino Energy LLC to us, and in exchange we issued subordinated units representing limited partner interests in us and common units to Wexford and issued incentive distribution rights to our general partner. In March 2016, Royal acquired our general partner and a majority limited partner interest in us from Wexford. Please read “—Recent Developments— Sale of our General Partner by Wexford.”
 
Since the formation of our predecessor in April 2003, we have completed numerous coal asset acquisitions with a total purchase price of approximately $357.5 million. Through these acquisitions and coal lease transactions, we have substantially increased our proven and probable coal reserves and non-reserve coal deposits. In addition, we have successfully grown our production through internal development projects. In addition to our coal acquisitions, in 2011 we began to invest in oil and natural gas assets and operations.
 
We are managed by the board of directors and executive officers of our general partner. Our operations are conducted through, and our operating assets are owned by, our wholly owned subsidiary, Rhino Energy LLC, and its subsidiaries.
 
Coal Operations
 
Mining and Leasing Operations
 
As of December 31, 2016, we operated two mining complexes located in Central Appalachia (Tug River and Rob Fork). In August 2016 we completed the sale of our Elk Horn coal leasing operation and in December 2015, we completed the sale of our Central Appalachia Deane mining complex (see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further information). In the third quarter of 2015, we temporarily idled a majority of our Central Appalachia operations due to ongoing weak coal market conditions for met and steam coal produced from this region. We resumed mining operations at all of our Central Appalachia operations in 2016 to fulfill customer contracts that we secured for 2016 and 2017.
 
In addition, we operated two mining complexes located in Northern Appalachia (Hopedale and Sands Hill). In the Western Bituminous region, we operated one mining complex located in Emery and Carbon Counties, Utah (Castle Valley). During 2014, we developed a new mining complex in the Illinois Basin, our Riveredge mine at our Pennyrile mining complex, which began production in mid-2014. The Pennyrile complex consists of one underground mine, a preparation plant and river loadout facility.
 
We define a mining complex as a central location for processing raw coal and loading coal into railroad cars, barges or trucks for shipment to customers. These mining complexes include seven active preparation plants and/or loadouts, each of which receive, blend, process and ship coal that is produced from one or more of our active surface and underground mines. All of the preparation plants are modern plants that have both coarse and fine coal cleaning circuits.

Our surface mines include area mining and contour mining. These operations use truck and wheel loader equipment fleets along with large production tractors and shovels. Our underground mines utilize the room and pillar mining method. These operations generally consist of one or more single or dual continuous miner sections which are made up of the continuous miner, shuttle cars, roof bolters, feeder and other support equipment. We currently own most of the equipment utilized in our mining operations. We employ preventive maintenance and rebuild programs to ensure that our equipment is modern and well-maintained. The rebuild programs are performed either by an on-site shop or by third-party manufacturers.
 
The following table summarizes our mining complexes and production by region as of December 31, 2016.

Central Appalachia. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we operated two mining complexes located in Central Appalachia consisting of one active underground mine and three surface mines. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the mines at our Tug River and Rob Fork mining complexes produced an aggregate of approximately 0.4 million tons of steam coal and an estimated 0.3 million tons of metallurgical coal.
 
Tug River Mining Complex. Our Tug River mining complex is located in Kentucky and West Virginia bordering the Tug River. This complex produces coal from two company operated surface mines, which includes one high-wall mining unit. Coal production from these operations is delivered to the Tug Fork preparation plant for processing and then transported by truck to the Jamboree rail loadout for blending and shipping. Coal suitable for direct-ship to customers is delivered by truck directly to the Jamboree rail loadout from the mine sites. The Tug Fork plant is a modern, 350 tons per hour preparation plant utilizing heavy media circuitry that is capable of cleaning coarse and fine coal size fractions. The Jamboree loadout is located on the Norfolk Southern Railroad and is a modern unit train, batch weigh loadout. This mining complex produced approximately 0.3 million tons of steam coal and approximately 0.1 million tons of metallurgical coal for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Rob Fork Mining Complex. Our Rob Fork mining complex is located in eastern Kentucky and produces coal from one company-operated surface mine and one company-operated underground mine. The Rob Fork mining complex is located on the CSX Railroad and consists of a modern preparation plant utilizing heavy media circuitry that is capable of cleaning coarse and fine coal size fractions and a unit train loadout with batch weighing equipment. The mining complex has significant blending capabilities allowing the blending of raw coals with washed coals to meet a wide variety of customers’ needs. The Rob Fork mining complex produced approximately 0.1 million tons of steam coal and 0.2 million tons of metallurgical coal for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
Northern Appalachia. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we operated two mining complexes located in Northern Appalachia consisting of one company-operated underground mine and two company-operated surface mines. Coal mining at our Sands Hill complex are planned to cease during the second quarter of 2017 as market conditions for coal from this complex have continued to be weak. We will continue our limestone aggregate business at the Sands Hill complex for the next twelve to eighteen months as we have enough limestone inventory to process and sell for this time period. For the year ended December 31, 2016, these mines produced an aggregate of approximately 0.4 million tons of steam coal.
 
Hopedale Mining Complex. The Hopedale mining complex includes an underground mine located in Hopedale, Ohio approximately five miles northeast of Cadiz, Ohio. Coal produced from the Hopedale mine is first cleaned at our Nelms preparation plant located on the Ohio Central Railroad and the Wheeling & Lake Erie Railroad and then shipped by train or truck to our customers. The infrastructure includes a full-service loadout facility. This underground mining operation produced approximately 0.3 million tons of steam coal for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
Sands Hill Mining Complex. We currently operate one surface mine at our Sands Hill mining complex, located near Hamden, Ohio, and we permanently idled the second surface mine at this complex during the second half of 2016. The infrastructure includes a preparation plant along with a river front barge and dock facility on the Ohio River. The Sands Hill mining complex produced approximately 0.1 million tons of steam coal and approximately 0.4 million tons of limestone aggregate for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
Western Bituminous Region. We operate one mining complex in the Western Bituminous region that produces coal from an underground mine located in Emery and Carbon Counties, Utah. We also had one underground mine located in the Western Bituminous region in Colorado (McClane Canyon) that was permanently idled at the end of 2013.
 
Castle Valley Mining Complex. Our Castle Valley mining complex includes one underground mine located in Emery and Carbon Counties, Utah and include coal reserves and non-reserve coal deposits, underground mining equipment and infrastructure, an overland belt conveyor system, a loading facility and support facilities. We produced approximately 0.9 million tons of steam coal from one underground mine at this complex for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
Illinois Basin. In May 2012, we completed the purchase of certain rights to coal leases and surface property that is contiguous to the Green River and located in Daviess and McLean counties in western Kentucky where we constructed a new underground mining complex. The property is fully permitted and provides us with access to Illinois Basin coal that is adjacent to a navigable waterway, which could allow for exports to non-U.S. customers. During 2014, we completed the initial construction of a new underground mining operation on this property. Production began in late May 2014 and the first barge shipments of coal departed from this facility in early July 2014. We have sales contracts with local electric utility customers and we have other potential customers that we believe could lead to additional long-term sales agreements if we can successfully expand our production capacity at this operation.
 
Pennyrile Mining Complex. In mid-2014, we completed the initial construction of a new underground mining operation on the purchased property, referred to as our Pennyrile mining complex, which includes one underground mine, a preparation plant and river loadout facility. Production from this underground mine began in mid-2014 and we produced approximately 1.3 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2016. We believe the possibility exists to expand production up to 2.0 million tons per year with further development of the mine at the Pennyrile complex.

Other Non-Mining Operations
 
In addition to our mining operations, we operate several subsidiaries which provide auxiliary services for our coal mining operations. Rhino Trucking provides our southeastern Ohio coal operations with reliable transportation to our customers where rail is not available. Rhino Services is responsible for mine-related construction, site and roadway maintenance and post-mining reclamation. Through Rhino Services, we plan and monitor each phase of our mining projects as well as the post-mining reclamation efforts. We also perform the majority of our drilling and blasting activities at our company-operated surface mines in-house rather than contracting to a third party.
Other Natural Resource Assets
 
Oil and Natural Gas
 
In addition to our coal operations, we have invested in oil and natural gas assets and operations.
 
In September 2014, we made an initial investment of $5.0 million in a new joint venture, Sturgeon Acquisitions LLC (“Sturgeon”), with affiliates of Wexford Capital and Gulfport Energy (“Gulfport”). Sturgeon subsequently acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests of certain limited liability companies located in Wisconsin that provide frac sand for oil and natural gas drillers in the United States. We account for the investment in this joint venture and results of operations under the equity method. We recorded our proportionate portion of the operating (losses)/gains for this investment during 2016 and 2015 of approximately ($0.2) million and $0.3 million, respectively.
 
In November 2014, we contributed our investment interest in a joint venture, Muskie Proppant LLC (“Muskie”) with affiliates of Wexford Capital that was formed to provide sand for fracking operations to drillers in the Utica Shale Region and other oil and natural gas basins in the United States to Mammoth Energy Partners LP (“Mammoth”) in return for a limited partner interest in Mammoth. Mammoth was formed to provide services to companies, which engage in the exploration and development of North American onshore unconventional oil and natural gas reserves. Mammoth provides services that include completion and production services, contract land and directional drilling services and remote accommodation services. The non-cash transaction was a contribution of our investment interest in the Muskie entity for an investment interest in Mammoth. Thus, we determined that the non-cash exchange of our ownership interest in Muskie did not result in any gain or loss. As of December 31, 2015, we recorded our investment in Mammoth of $1.9 million as a long-term asset, which we recorded as a cost method investment based upon our ownership percentage. In October 2016, we contributed our limited partner interests in Mammoth to Mammoth Energy Services, Inc. (“Mammoth Inc.”) in exchange for 234,300 shares of common stock of Mammoth Inc. The common stock of Mammoth Inc. began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market in October 2016 under the ticker symbol TUSK and we sold 1,953 shares during the initial public offering of Mammoth Inc. and received proceeds of approximately $27,000. Our remaining shares of Mammoth Inc. are subject to a 180 day lock-up period from the date of Mammoth Inc.’s initial public offering. As of December 31, 2016, we recorded a fair market value adjustment of $1.6 million for the available-for-sale investment, which was recorded in other comprehensive income. We have included our investment in Mammoth and our prior investment in Muskie in our Other category for segment reporting purposes.
 
Limestone
 
Incidental to our coal mining process, we mine limestone from reserves located at our Sands Hill mining complex and sell it as aggregate to various construction companies and road builders that are located in close proximity to the mining complex when market conditions are favorable. We believe that our production of limestone provides us with an additional source of revenues at low incremental capital cost for the next twelve to eighteen months.
Coal Customers
 
General
 
Our primary customers for our steam coal are electric utilities, and the metallurgical coal we produce is sold primarily to domestic and international steel producers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 90.0% of our coal sales tons consisted of steam coal and approximately 10.0% consisted of metallurgical coal. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 83.0% of our coal sales tons that we produced were sold to electric utilities. The majority of our electric utility customers purchase coal for terms of one to three years, but we also supply coal on a spot basis for some of our customers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we derived approximately 87.4% of our total coal revenues from sales to our ten largest customers, with affiliates of our top three customers accounting for approximately 48.5% of our coal revenues for that period: PPL Corporation (26.2%); PacificCorp Energy (12.2%); and Big Rivers (10.1%). Incidental to our coal mining process, we mine limestone and sell it as aggregate to various construction companies and road builders that are located in close proximity to our Sands Hill mining complex.

Coal Supply Contracts
 
For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 90% and 84%, respectively, of our aggregate coal tons sold were sold through supply contracts. We expect to continue selling a significant portion of our coal under supply contracts. As of December 31, 2016, we had commitments under supply contracts to deliver annually scheduled base quantities as follows:

Year | Tons (in thousands) | | Number of customers
-----+---------------------+-------+--------------------
2017 | | 3,669 | | 14
2018 | | 701 | | 5 

 
Some of the contracts have sales price adjustment provisions, subject to certain limitations and adjustments, based on a variety of factors and indices.
 
Quality and volumes for the coal are stipulated in coal supply contracts, and in some instances buyers have the option to vary annual or monthly volumes. Most of our coal supply contracts contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal within certain ranges for specific coal characteristics such as heat content, sulfur, ash, hardness and ash fusion temperature. Failure to meet these specifications can result in economic penalties, suspension or cancellation of shipments or termination of the contracts. Some of our contracts specify approved locations from which coal may be sourced. Some of our contracts set out mechanisms for temporary reductions or delays in coal volumes in the event of a force majeure, including events such as strikes, adverse mining conditions, mine closures, or serious transportation problems that affect us or unanticipated plant outages that may affect the buyers.
 
The terms of our coal supply contracts result from competitive bidding procedures and extensive negotiations with customers. As a result, the terms of these contracts, including price adjustment features, price re-opener terms, coal quality requirements, quantity parameters, permitted sources of supply, future regulatory changes, extension options, force majeure, termination and assignment provisions, vary significantly by customer.
 
Transportation
 
We ship coal to our customers by rail, truck or barge. The majority of our coal is transported to customers by either the CSX Railroad or the Norfolk Southern Railroad in eastern Kentucky and by the Ohio Central Railroad or the Wheeling & Lake Erie Railroad in Ohio. In addition, in southeastern Ohio, we use our own trucking operations to transport coal to our customers where rail is not available. We use third-party trucking to transport coal to our customers in Utah. For our Pennyrile complex in western Kentucky, coal is transported to our customers via barge from our river loadout on the Green River located on our Pennyrile mining complex. In addition, coal from certain of our Central Appalachia and southern Ohio mines is located within economical trucking distance to the Big Sandy River and/or the Ohio River and can be transported by barge. It is customary for customers to pay the transportation costs to their location.
 
We believe that we have good relationships with rail carriers, barge companies and truck companies due, in part, to our modern coal-loading facilities at our loadouts and the working relationships and experience of our transportation and distribution employees.
 
Suppliers
 
Principal supplies used in our business include diesel fuel, explosives, maintenance and repair parts and services, roof control and support items, tires, conveyance structures, ventilation supplies and lubricants. We use third-party suppliers for a significant portion of our equipment rebuilds and repairs, drilling services and construction.
 
We have a centralized sourcing group for major supplier contract negotiation and administration, for the negotiation and purchase of major capital goods and to support the mining and coal preparation plants. We are not dependent on any one supplier in any region. We promote competition between suppliers and seek to develop relationships with those suppliers whose focus is on lowering our costs. We seek suppliers who identify and concentrate on implementing continuous improvement opportunities within their area of expertise.

Competition
 
The coal industry is highly competitive. There are numerous large and small producers in all coal producing regions of the United States and we compete with many of these producers. Our main competitors include Alliance Resource Partners LP, Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., Arch Coal, Inc., Booth Energy Group, Murray Energy Corporation, Foresight Energy LP, Westmoreland Resource Partners, LP and Bowie Resource Partners LLC.
 
The most important factors on which we compete are coal price, coal quality and characteristics, transportation costs and the reliability of supply. Demand for coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our coal are closely linked to coal consumption patterns of the domestic electric generation industry and international consumers. These coal consumption patterns are influenced by factors beyond our control, including demand for electricity, which is significantly dependent upon economic activity and summer and winter temperatures in the United States, government regulation, technological developments and the location, availability, quality and price of competing sources of fuel such as natural gas, oil and nuclear, and alternative energy sources such as hydroelectric power and wind power.
 
Regulation and Laws
 
Our operations are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities on matters such as:
 

● | employee health and safety; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | governmental approvals and other authorizations such as mine permits, as well as other licensing requirements; 
● | air quality standards; 
● | water quality standards; 
● | storage, treatment, use and disposal of petroleum products and other hazardous substances; 
● | plant and wildlife protection; 
● | reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed; 
● | the discharge of materials into the environment, including waterways or wetlands; 
● | storage and handling of explosives; 
● | wetlands protection; 
● | surface subsidence from underground mining; 
● | the effects, if any, that mining has on groundwater quality and availability; and 
● | legislatively mandated benefits for current and retired coal miners. 

 
In addition, many of our customers are subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impacts associated with the combustion or other use of coal, which could affect demand for our coal. The possibility exists that new laws or regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, may be adopted that may have a significant impact on our mining operations, oil and natural gas investments, or our customers’ ability to use coal. Moreover, environmental citizen groups frequently challenge coal mining, terminal construction, and other related projects.
 
We are committed to conducting mining operations in compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. However, because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements, violations during mining operations occur from time to time. Violations, including violations of any permit or approval, can result in substantial civil and in severe cases, criminal fines and penalties, including revocation or suspension of mining permits. None of the violations to date have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition.

While it is not possible to quantify the costs of compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, those costs have been and are expected to continue to be significant. Nonetheless, capital expenditures for environmental matters have not been material in recent years. We have accrued for the present value of estimated cost of reclamation and mine closings, including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary. The accruals for reclamation and mine closing costs are based upon permit requirements and the costs and timing of reclamation and mine closing procedures. Although management believes it has made adequate provisions for all expected reclamation and other costs associated with mine closures, future operating results would be adversely affected if we later determined these accruals to be insufficient. Compliance with these laws and regulations has substantially increased the cost of coal mining for all domestic coal producers. Most of the statutes discussed below apply to exploration and development activities associated with our oil and natural gas investments as well, and therefore we do not present a separate discussion of statutes related to those activities.
 
Mining Permits and Approvals
 
Numerous governmental permits or approvals are required for coal mining operations. When we apply for these permits and approvals, we are often required to assess the effect or impact that any proposed production of coal may have upon the environment. Final guidance released by the CEQ regarding climate change considerations in the NEPA analyses may increase the likelihood of future challenges to the NEPA documents prepared for actions requiring federal approval. The permit application requirements may be costly and time consuming, and may delay or prevent commencement or continuation of mining operations in certain locations. In addition, these permits and approvals can result in the imposition of numerous restrictions on the time, place and manner in which coal mining operations are conducted. Future laws and regulations may emphasize more heavily the protection of the environment and, as a consequence, our activities may be more closely regulated. Laws and regulations, as well as future interpretations or enforcement of existing laws and regulations, may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs, or delays, interruptions or terminations of operations, the extent of any of which cannot be predicted. For example, in January 2016, the federal Bureau of Land Management announced a moratorium on new coal leases for federal lands. The moratorium does not affect existing leases. In addition, the permitting process for certain mining operations can extend over several years, and can be subject to judicial challenge, including by the public. Some required mining permits are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain in a timely manner, or at all. We may experience difficulty and/or delay in obtaining mining permits in the future.
 
Regulations provide that a mining permit can be refused or revoked if the permit applicant or permittee owns or controls, directly or indirectly through other entities, mining operations which have outstanding environmental violations. Although, like other coal companies, we have been cited for violations in the ordinary course of business, we have never had a permit suspended or revoked because of any violation, and the penalties assessed for these violations have not been material.
 
Before commencing mining on a particular property, we must obtain mining permits and approvals by state regulatory authorities of a reclamation plan for restoring, upon the completion of mining, the mined property to its approximate prior condition, productive use or other permitted condition.
 
Mine Health and Safety Laws
 
Stringent safety and health standards have been in effect since the adoption of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”), and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, significantly expanded the enforcement of health and safety standards and imposed comprehensive safety and health standards on numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, blasting, the equipment used in mining operations and other matters. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) monitors compliance with these laws and regulations. In addition, the states where we operate also have state programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement. Federal and state safety and health regulations affecting the coal industry are complex, rigorous and comprehensive, and have a significant effect on our operating costs.
 
The Mine Act is a strict liability statute that requires mandatory inspections of surface and underground coal mines and requires the issuance of enforcement action when it is believed that a standard has been violated. A penalty is required to be imposed for each cited violation. Negligence and gravity assessments result in a cumulative enforcement scheme that may result in the issuance of an order requiring the immediate withdrawal of miners from the mine or shutting down a mine or any section of a mine or any piece of mine equipment. The Mine Act contains criminal liability provisions. For example, criminal liability may be imposed for corporate operators who knowingly or willfully authorize, order or carry out violations. The Mine Act also provides that civil and criminal penalties may be assessed against individual agents, officers and directors who knowingly authorize, order or carry out violations.

We have developed a health and safety management system that, among other things, includes training regarding worker health and safety requirements including those arising under federal and state laws that apply to our mines. In addition, our health and safety management system tracks the performance of each operational facility in meeting the requirements of safety laws and company safety policies. As an example of the resources we allocate to health and safety matters, our safety management system includes a company-wide safety director and local safety directors who oversee safety and compliance at operations on a day-to-day basis. We continually monitor the performance of our safety management system and from time-to-time modify that system to address findings or reflect new requirements or for other reasons. We have even integrated safety matters into our compensation and retention decisions. For instance, our bonus program includes a meaningful evaluation of each eligible employee’s role in complying with, fostering and furthering our safety policies.
 
We evaluate a variety of safety-related metrics to assess the adequacy and performance of our safety management system. For example, we monitor and track performance in areas such as “accidents, reportable accidents, lost time accidents and the lost-time accident frequency rate” and a number of others. Each of these metrics provides insights and perspectives into various aspects of our safety systems and performance at particular locations or mines generally and, among other things, can indicate where improvements are needed or further evaluation is warranted with regard to the system or its implementation. An important part of this evaluation is to assess our performance relative to certain national benchmarks.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2016 our average MSHA violations per inspection day was 0.25 as compared to the most recent national average of 0.67 violations per inspection day for coal mining activity as reported by MSHA, or 62.69% below this national average.
 
Mining accidents in the last several years in West Virginia, Kentucky and Utah have received national attention and instigated responses at the state and national levels that have resulted in increased scrutiny of current safety practices and procedures at all mining operations, particularly underground mining operations. For example, in 2014, MSHA adopted a final rule to lower miners’ exposure to respirable coal mine dust. The rule had a phased implementation schedule. The second phase of the rule went into effect in February 2016, and requires increased sampling frequency and the use of continuous personal dust monitors. In August 2016, the third and final phase of the rule became effective, reducing the overall respirable dust standard in coal mines from 2.0 to 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter of air. Additionally, in September 2015, MSHA issued a proposed rule requiring the installation of proximity detection systems on coal hauling machines and scoops. Proximity detection is a technology that uses electronic sensors to detect motion and the distance between a miner and a machine. These systems provide audible and visual warnings, and automatically stop moving machines when miners are in the machines’ path. These and other new safety rules could result in increased compliance costs on our operations.
 
In addition, more stringent mine safety laws and regulations promulgated by these states and the federal government have included increased sanctions for non-compliance. For example, in 2006, the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, or MINER Act, was enacted. The MINER Act significantly amended the Mine Act, requiring improvements in mine safety practices, increasing criminal penalties and establishing a maximum civil penalty for non-compliance, and expanding the scope of federal oversight, inspection and enforcement activities. Since passage of the MINER Act in 2006, enforcement scrutiny has increased, including more inspection hours at mine sites, increased numbers of inspections and increased issuance of the number and the severity of enforcement actions and related penalties. For example, in July 2014, MSHA proposed a rule that revises its civil penalty assessment provisions and how regulators should approach calculating penalties, which, in some instances, could result in increased civil penalty assessments for medium and larger mine operators and contractors by 300 to 1,000 percent. MSHA proposed some revisions to the original proposed rule in February 2015, but, to date, has not taken any further action. Other states have proposed or passed similar bills, resolutions or regulations addressing enhanced mine safety practices and increased fines and penalties. Moreover, workplace accidents, such as the April 5, 2010, Upper Big Branch Mine incident, have resulted in more inspection hours at mine sites, increased number of inspections and increased issuance of the number and severity of enforcement actions and the passage of new laws and regulations. These trends are likely to continue.
 
Indeed, in 2013, MSHA began implementing its recently released Pattern of Violation (“POV”) regulations under the Mine Act. Under this regulation, MSHA eliminated the ninety (90) day window to take corrective action and engage in mitigation efforts for mine operators who met certain initial POV screening criteria. Additionally, MSHA will make POV determinations based upon enforcement actions as issued, rather than enforcement actions that have been rendered final following the opportunity for administrative or judicial review. After a mine operator has been placed on POV status, MSHA will thereafter issue an order withdrawing miners from the area affected by any enforcement action designated by MSHA as posing a significant and substantial, or S&S, hazard to the health and/or safety of miners. Further, once designated as a POV mine, a mine operator can be removed from POV status only upon: (1) a complete inspection of the entire mine with no S&S enforcement actions issued by MSHA; or (2) no POV-related withdrawal orders being issued by MSHA within ninety (90) days of the mine operator being placed on POV status. Although it remains to be seen how these new regulations will ultimately affect production at our mines, they are consistent with the trend of more stringent enforcement.

From time to time, certain portions of individual mines have been required to suspend or shut down operations temporarily in order to address a compliance requirement or because of an accident. For instance, MSHA issues orders pursuant to Section 103(k) that, among other things, call for operations in the area of the mine at issue to suspend operations until compliance is restored. Likewise, if an accident occurs within a mine, the MSHA requirements call for all operations in that area to be suspended until the circumstance leading to the accident has been resolved. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (as in earlier years), we received such orders from government agencies and have experienced accidents within our mines requiring the suspension or shutdown of operations in those particular areas until the circumstances leading to the accident have been resolved. While the violations or other circumstances that caused such an accident were being addressed, other areas of the mine could and did remain operational. These circumstances did not require us to suspend operations on a mine-wide level or otherwise entail material financial or operational consequences for us. Any suspension of operations at any one of our locations that may occur in the future may have material financial or operational consequences for us.
 
It is our practice to contest notices of violations in cases in which we believe we have a good faith defense to the alleged violation or the proposed penalty and/or other legitimate grounds to challenge the alleged violation or the proposed penalty. We exercise substantial efforts toward achieving compliance at our mines. For example, we have further increased our focus with regard to health and safety at all of our mines. These efforts include hiring additional skilled personnel, providing training programs, hosting quarterly safety meetings with MSHA personnel and making capital expenditures in consultation with MSHA aimed at increasing mine safety. We believe that these efforts have contributed, and continue to contribute, positively to safety and compliance at our mines. In “Part 1, Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosure” and in Exhibit 95.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we provide additional details on how we monitor safety performance and MSHA compliance, as well as provide the mine safety disclosures required pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
 
Black Lung Laws
 
Under the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, as amended in 1981, coal mine operators must make payments of black lung benefits to current and former coal miners with black lung disease, some survivors of a miner who dies from this disease, and to fund a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants who last worked in the industry prior to January 1, 1970. To help fund these benefits, a tax is levied on production of $1.10 per ton for underground-mined coal and $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, but not to exceed 4.4% of the applicable sales price. This excise tax does not apply to coal that is exported outside of the United States. In 2016, we recorded approximately $3.0 million of expense related to this excise tax.
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes significant changes to the federal black lung program including an automatic survivor benefit paid upon the death of a miner with an awarded black lung claim and establishes a rebuttable presumption with regard to pneumoconiosis among miners with 15 or more years of coal mine employment that are totally disabled by a respiratory condition. These changes could have a material impact on our costs expended in association with the federal black lung program. We may also be liable under state laws for black lung claims that are covered through either insurance policies or state programs.
 
Workers’ Compensation
 
We are required to compensate employees for work-related injuries under various state workers’ compensation laws. The states in which we operate consider changes in workers’ compensation laws from time to time. Our costs will vary based on the number of accidents that occur at our mines and other facilities, and our costs of addressing these claims. We are insured under the Ohio State Workers Compensation Program for our operations in Ohio. Our remaining operations, including Central Appalachia and the Western Bituminous region, are insured through Rockwood Casualty Insurance Company.

Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (“SMCRA”)
 
SMCRA establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining, including the surface effects of underground coal mining. SMCRA requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and upon completion of mining activities. In conjunction with mining the property, we reclaim and restore the mined areas by grading, shaping and preparing the soil for seeding. Upon completion of mining, reclamation generally is completed by seeding with grasses or planting trees for a variety of uses, as specified in the approved reclamation plan. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations relating to reclamation.
 
SMCRA and similar state statutes require, among other things, that mined property be restored in accordance with specified standards and approved reclamation plans. The act requires that we restore the surface to approximate the original contours as soon as practicable upon the completion of surface mining operations. The mine operator must submit a bond or otherwise secure the performance of these reclamation obligations. Mine operators can also be responsible for replacing certain water supplies damaged by mining operations and repairing or compensating for damage to certain structures occurring on the surface as a result of mine subsidence, a consequence of long-wall mining and possibly other mining operations. In addition, the Abandoned Mine Lands Program, which is part of SMCRA, imposes a tax on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are used to restore mines closed prior to SMCRA’s adoption in 1977. The maximum tax for the period from October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2021, has been decreased to 28 cents per ton on surface mined coal and 12 cents per ton on underground mined coal. However, this fee is subject to change. The President’s Budget for Fiscal Year 2017 proposes to restore fees on coal production to pre-2006 levels in order to fund the reclamation of abandoned mines. If enacted into law, this proposal would increase the fees on surface mining to $0.35 per ton and increase the fees on underground mining to $0.15 per ton. Given the market for coal, it is unlikely that coal mining companies would be able to recover all of these fees from their customers. As of December 31, 2016, we had accrued approximately $23.3 million for the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing, including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary. In addition, states from time to time have increased and may continue to increase their fees and taxes to fund reclamation of orphaned mine sites and abandoned mine drainage control on a statewide basis.
 
After a mine application is submitted, public notice or advertisement of the proposed permit action is required, which is followed by a public comment period. It is not uncommon for a SMCRA mine permit application to take over two years to prepare and review, depending on the size and complexity of the mine, and another two years or even longer for the permit to be issued. The variability in time frame required to prepare the application and issue the permit can be attributed primarily to the various regulatory authorities’ discretion in the handling of comments and objections relating to the project received from the general public and other agencies. Also, it is not uncommon for a permit to be delayed as a result of judicial challenges related to the specific permit or another related company’s permit.
 
Federal laws and regulations also provide that a mining permit or modification can be delayed, refused or revoked if owners of specific percentages of ownership interests or controllers (i.e., officers and directors or other entities) of the applicant have, or are affiliated with another entity that has outstanding violations of SMCRA or state or tribal programs authorized by SMCRA. This condition is often referred to as being “permit blocked” under the federal Applicant Violator Systems, or AVS. Thus, non-compliance with SMCRA can provide the bases to deny the issuance of new mining permits or modifications of existing mining permits, although we know of no basis by which we would be (and we are not now) permit-blocked.
 
In addition, a February 2014 decision by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia invalidated the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement’s (“OSM”) 2008 Stream Buffer Zone Rule, which prohibited mining disturbances within 100 feet of streams, subject to various exemptions. In December 2016, the OSM published the final Stream Protection Rule, which, among other things, would require operators to test and monitor conditions of streams they might impact before, during and after mining. The final rule took effect in January 2017 and would have required mine operators to collect additional baseline data about the site of the proposed mining operation and adjacent areas; imposed additional surface and groundwater monitoring requirements; enacted specific requirements for the protection or restoration of perennial and intermittent streams; and imposed additional bonding and financial assurance requirements. However, in February 2017, both the House and the Senate passed measures to revoke the Stream Protection Rule under the Congressional Review Act (“CRA”), which gives Congress the ability to repeal regulations promulgated in the last 60 days of the congressional session. President Trump signed the resolution on February 16, 2017 and, pursuant to the CRA, the Stream Protection Rule “shall have no force or effect” and OSM cannot promulgate a substantially similar rule absent future legislation. Whether Congress will enact future legislation to require a new Stream Protection Rule remains uncertain. A new Stream Protection Rule, or other new SMCRA regulations, could result in additional material costs, obligations, and restrictions associated with our operations.

Surety Bonds
 
Federal and state laws require a mine operator to secure the performance of its reclamation obligations required under SMCRA through the use of surety bonds or other approved forms of performance security to cover the costs the state would incur if the mine operator were unable to fulfill its obligations. It has become increasingly difficult for mining companies to secure new surety bonds without the posting of partial collateral. In August 2016, the OSMRE issued a Policy Advisory discouraging state regulatory authorities from approving self-bonding arrangements. The Policy Advisory indicated that the OSM would begin more closely reviewing instances in which states accept self-bonds for mining operations. In the same month, the OSM also announced that it was beginning the rulemaking process to strengthen regulations on self-bonding. In addition, surety bond costs have increased while the market terms of surety bond have generally become less favorable. It is possible that surety bonds issuers may refuse to renew bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals. Our failure to maintain, or inability to acquire, surety bonds that are required by state and federal laws would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce coal, which could affect our profitability and cash flow.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $48.9 million in surety bonds outstanding to secure the performance of our reclamation obligations. We may be required to increase these amounts as a result of recent developments in West Virginia and Kentucky. In 2011, West Virginia passed legislation that provides for a minimum incremental bonding rate in lieu of a minimum bond amount that applies regardless of acreage. In addition, the Kentucky Department for Natural Resources and the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement Lexington Field Office executed an Action Plan for Improving the Adequacy of Kentucky Performance Bond Amounts, which provides for, among other things, revised bond computation protocols.
 
Air Emissions
 
The federal Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and similar state and local laws and regulations, which regulate emissions into the air, affect coal mining operations both directly and indirectly. The CAA directly impacts our coal mining and processing operations by imposing permitting requirements and, in some cases, requirements to install certain emissions control equipment, on sources that emit various hazardous and non-hazardous air pollutants. The CAA also indirectly affects coal mining operations by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal-fired electric power generating plants and other industrial consumers of coal, including air emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulates, mercury and other compounds. There have been a series of recent federal rulemakings from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, which are focused on emissions from coal-fired electric generating facilities. For example, In June 2015, the United States Supreme Court decided Michigan v. the EPA, which held that the EPA should have considered the compliance costs associated with its Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, or MATS, in deciding to regulate power plants under Section 112(n)(1) of the Clean Air Act. The Court did not vacate the MATS rule, and MATS has remained in place. In April 2016, EPA published its final supplemental finding that it is “appropriate and necessary” to regulate coal and oil-fired units under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act. In August 2016, EPA denied two petitions for reconsideration of startup and shutdown provisions in MATS, leaving in place the startup and shutdown provisions finalized in November 2014. The MATS rule was expected to result in the retirement of certain older coal plants. It remains to be seen whether any power plants may reevaluate their decision to retire following the Supreme Court’s decision and EPA’s recent actions, or whether plants that have already installed certain controls to comply with MATS will continue to operate them at all times. Installation of additional emissions control technology and additional measures required under laws and regulations related to air emissions will make it more costly to operate coal-fired power plants and possibly other facilities that consume coal and, depending on the requirements of individual state implementation plans, or SIPs, could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future.
 
In addition to the greenhouse gas (“GHG”) regulations discussed below, air emission control programs that affect our operations, directly or indirectly, through impacts to coal-fired utilities and other manufacturing plants, include, but are not limited to, the following:

● | The EPA’s Acid Rain Program, provided in Title IV of the CAA, regulates emissions of sulfur dioxide from electric generating facilities. Sulfur dioxide is a by-product of coal combustion. Affected facilities purchase or are otherwise allocated sulfur dioxide emissions allowances, which must be surrendered annually in an amount equal to a facility’s sulfur dioxide emissions in that year. Affected facilities may sell or trade excess allowances to other facilities that require additional allowances to offset their sulfur dioxide emissions. In addition to purchasing or trading for additional sulfur dioxide allowances, affected power facilities can satisfy the requirements of the EPA’s Acid Rain Program by switching to lower sulfur fuels, installing pollution control devices such as flue gas desulfurization systems, or “scrubbers,” or by reducing electricity generating levels.

● | On July 6, 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (“CSAPR”), which requires the District of Columbia and 27 states from Texas eastward (not including the New England states or Delaware) to significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution in other states. Under the CSAPR, the first phase of the nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions reductions was to commence in 2012 with further reductions effective in 2014. In October 2011, the EPA proposed amendments to the CSAPR to increase emission budgets in ten states, including Texas, and ease limits on market-based compliance options. While the CSAPR had an initial compliance deadline of January 1, 2012, the rule was challenged and, on December 30, 2011, the D.C. Circuit stayed the rule and advised that the EPA was expected to continue administering the Clean Air Interstate Rule until the pending challenges are resolved. The court vacated the CSAPR on August 21, 2012, in a two to one decision, concluding that the rule was beyond the EPA’s statutory authority. The U.S. Supreme Court on April 29, 2014 reversed the D.C. Circuit and upheld the CSAPR, concluding generally that the EPA’s development and promulgation of CSAPR was lawful, while acknowledging the possibility that under certain circumstances some states may have a basis to bring a particularized, as-applied challenge to the rule. In October 2014, the D.C. Circuit filed an order lifting its stay of CSAPR and addressing a number of preliminary motions regarding the implementation of the Supreme Court’s remand. On remand, the D.C. Circuit court held on July 28, 2015 that certain of EPA’s Phase II emission budgets were invalid because they required more emissions reductions than necessary to achieve the desired air pollutant reduction in the relevant downwind states. The court did not vacate the rule but required the EPA to reconsider the invalid emissions budgets. In September 2016, EPA finalized the CSAPR Rule Update for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Starting in May 2017, the rule will reduce summertime NOx emissions from power plants in 22 states in the eastern United States. 
● | In addition, in January 2013, the EPA issued final MACT standards for several classes of boilers and process heaters, including large coal-fired boilers and process heaters (Boiler MACT), which require significant reductions in the emission of particulate matter, carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride, dioxins and mercury. Business and environmental groups have filed legal challenges in federal appeals court and have petitioned EPA to reconsider the rule. EPA has granted petitions for reconsideration for certain issues and promulgated a revised final rule in November 2015. The EPA retained a minimum carbon monoxide limit of 130 parts per million and the particulate matter continuous parameter monitoring system requirements, consistent with the January 2013 final rule, but made some minor changes to provisions related to boiler startup and shutdown practices. In July 2016, the D.C. Circuit issued a ruling on the consolidated cases challenging Boiler MACT, vacating key portions of the rule, including emission limits for certain subcategories of solid fuel boilers, and remanding other issues to the EPA for further rulemaking. In December 2016, the court issued a decision denying a full panel rehearing and remanding without vacating the numeric MACT standards set in the Major Boilers Rule for new and existing sources in each of the 18 subcategories. Certiorari petitions are likely. We cannot predict the outcome of any legal challenges that may be filed in the future, however, if Boiler MACT is upheld as previously finalized, EPA estimates the rule will affect 1,700 existing major source facilities with an estimated 14,316 boilers and process heaters. Some owners will make capital expenditures to retrofit boilers and process heaters, while a number of boilers and process heaters will be prematurely retired. The retirements are likely to reduce the demand for coal. The impact of the regulations will depend on the outcome of future legal challenges and EPA actions cannot be determined at this time. 
● | The EPA has adopted new, more stringent national air quality standards (“NAAQS”) for ozone, fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. As a result, some states will be required to amend their existing SIPs to attain and maintain compliance with the new air quality standards. For example, in June 2010, the EPA issued a final rule setting forth a more stringent primary NAAQS applicable to sulfur dioxide. The rule also modifies the monitoring increment for the sulfur dioxide standard, establishing a 1-hour standard, and expands the sulfur dioxide monitoring network. Initial non-attainment determinations related to the 2010 sulfur dioxide rule were published in August 2013 with an effective date in October 2013. States with non-attainment areas had to submit their SIP revisions in April 2015, which must meet the modified standard by summer 2017. For all other areas, states will be required to submit “maintenance” SIPs. EPA finalized its PM2.5 NAAQS designations in December 2014. Individual states must now identify the sources of PM2.5 emissions and develop emission reduction plans, which may be state-specific or regional in scope. Nonattainment areas must meet the revised standard no later than 2021. More recently, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. Significant additional emissions control expenditures will likely be required at coal-fired power plants and coke plants to meet the new standards. Because coal mining operations and coal-fired electric generating facilities emit particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, our mining operations and customers could be affected when the standards are implemented by the applicable states. Moreover, we could face adverse impacts on our business to the extent that these and any other new rules affecting coal-fired power plants result in reduced demand for coal.

● | In June 2005, the EPA amended its regional haze program to improve visibility in national parks and wilderness areas. Affected states were required to develop SIPs by December 2007 that, among other things, identify facilities that will have to reduce emissions and comply with stricter emission limitations. Implementation of this program may restrict construction of new coal-fired power plants where emissions are projected to reduce visibility in protected areas. In addition, this program may require certain existing coal-fired power plants to install emissions control equipment to reduce haze-causing emissions such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter. Consequently, demand for our steam coal could be affected. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, over the years, the Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, has filed lawsuits against a number of coal-fired electric generating facilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAA. The EPA has alleged that certain modifications have been made to these facilities without first obtaining certain permits issued under the new source review program. Several of these lawsuits have settled, but others remain pending. Depending on the ultimate resolution of these cases, demand for our coal could be affected.
 
Non-government organizations have also petitioned EPA to regulate coal mines as stationary sources under the Clean Air Act. On May 13, 2014, the D.C. Circuit in WildEarth Guardians v. United States Environmental Protection Agency upheld EPA’s denial of one such petition. On July 18, 2014, the D.C. Circuit denied a petition to rehear that case en banc. We cannot guarantee that these groups will not make similar efforts in the future. If such efforts are successful, emissions of these or other materials associated with our mining operations could become subject to further regulation pursuant to existing laws such as the CAA. In that event, we may be required to install additional emissions control equipment or take other steps to lower emissions associated with our operations, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely affecting our operations.
 
Climate Change
 
One by-product of burning coal is carbon dioxide or CO2, which EPA considers a GHG and a major source of concern with respect to climate change and global warming.
 
On the international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that agreed on December 12, 2015 to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France, that calls for countries to set their own GHG emission targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emission targets; however, the agreement does not set binding GHG emission reduction targets. The Paris climate agreement entered into force in November 2016.
 
At the Federal level, EPA has taken a number of steps to regulate GHG emissions. For example, in August 2015, the EPA issued its final Clean Power Plan (the “CPP”) rules that establish carbon pollution standards for power plants, called CO2 emission performance rates. The EPA expects each state to develop implementation plans for power plants in its state to meet the individual state targets established in the CPP. The compliance period begins in 2022, and emission reductions will be phased in up to 2030. The EPA also proposed a federal compliance plan to implement the CPP in the event that an approvable state plan is not submitted to the EPA. Judicial challenges have been filed. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the implementation of the CPP. By its terms, this stay will remain in effect throughout the pendency of the appeals process. The stay suspends the rule, including the requirement that states submit their initial plans by September 2016. The Supreme Court’s stay applies only to EPA’s regulations for CO2 emissions from existing power plants and will not affect EPA’s standards for new power plants. It is not yet clear how the courts will rule on the legality of the CPP. Additionally, it is unclear how the CPP will be impacted under President Trump’s new administration. If the rules were upheld at the conclusion of this appellate process and were implemented in their current form, demand for coal will likely be further decreased. The EPA also issued a final rule for new coal-fired power plants in August 2015, which essentially set performance standards for coal-fired power plants that requires partial carbon capture and sequestration (“CCS”). Additional legal challenges have been filed against the EPA’s rules for new power plants. The EPA’s GHG rules for new and existing power plants, taken together, have the potential to severely reduce demand for coal. In addition, passage of any comprehensive federal climate change and energy legislation could impact the demand for coal. Any reduction in the amount of coal consumed by North American electric power generators could reduce the price of coal that we mine and sell, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations.

Many states and regions have adopted greenhouse gas initiatives and certain governmental bodies have or are considering the imposition of fees or taxes based on the emission of greenhouse gases by certain facilities, including coal-fired electric generating facilities. For example, in 2005, ten northeastern states entered into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative agreement (“RGGI”) calling for implementation of a cap and trade program aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in the participating states. The members of RGGI have established in statute and/or regulation a carbon dioxide trading program. Auctions for carbon dioxide allowances under the program began in September 2008. Though New Jersey withdrew from RGGI in 2011, since its inception, several additional northeastern states and Canadian provinces have joined as participants or observers.
 
Following the RGGI model, five Western states launched the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative to identify, evaluate and implement collective and cooperative methods of reducing greenhouse gases in the region to 15% below 2005 levels by 2020. These states were joined by two additional states and four Canadian provinces and became collectively known as the Western Climate Initiative Partners. However, in November 2011, six states withdrew, leaving California and the four Canadian provinces as members. At a January 12, 2012 stakeholder meeting, this group confirmed a commitment and timetable to create the largest carbon market in North America and provide a model to guide future efforts to establish national approaches in both Canada and the U.S. to reduce GHG emissions. It is likely that these regional efforts will continue.
 
Many coal-fired plants have already closed or announced plans to close and proposed new construction projects have also come under additional scrutiny with respect to GHG emissions. There have been an increasing number of protests and challenges to the permitting of new coal-fired power plants by environmental organizations and state regulators due to concerns related to greenhouse gas emissions. Other state regulatory authorities have also rejected the construction of new coal-fueled power plants based on the uncertainty surrounding the potential costs associated with GHG emissions from these plants under future laws limiting the emissions of carbon dioxide. In addition, several permits issued to new coal-fired power plants without limits on GHG emissions have been appealed to the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board. In addition, over 30 states have adopted mandatory “renewable portfolio standards,” which require electric utilities to obtain a certain percentage of their electric generation portfolio from renewable resources by a certain date. These standards range generally from 10% to 30%, over time periods that generally extend from the present until between 2020 and 2030. Other states may adopt similar requirements, and federal legislation is a possibility in this area. To the extent these requirements affect our current and prospective customers; they may reduce the demand for coal-fired power, and may affect long-term demand for our coal.
 
If mandatory restrictions on CO2 emissions are imposed, the ability to capture and store large volumes of carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants may be a key mitigation technology to achieve emissions reductions while meeting projected energy demands. A number of recent legislative and regulatory initiatives to encourage the development and use of carbon capture and storage technology have been proposed or enacted. For example, in October 2015, the EPA released a rule that established, for the first time, new source performance standards under the federal Clean Air Act for CO2 emissions from new fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating power plants. The EPA has designated partial carbon capture and sequestration as the best system of emission reduction for newly constructed fossil fuel-fired steam generating units at power plants to employ to meet the standard. However, widespread cost-effective deployment of CCS will occur only if the technology is commercially available at economically competitive prices and supportive national policy frameworks are in place.
 
There have also been attempts to encourage greater regulation of coalbed methane because methane has a greater GHG effect than CO2. Methane from coal mines can give rise to safety concerns, and may require that various measures be taken to mitigate those risks. If new laws or regulations were introduced to reduce coalbed methane emissions, those rules could adversely affect our costs of operations.
 
Finally, some scientists have warned that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If these warnings are correct, and if any such effects were to occur in areas where we or our customers operate, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.

Clean Water Act
 
The Federal Clean Water Act (the “CWA”) and similar state and local laws and regulations affect coal mining operations by imposing restrictions on the discharge of pollutants, including dredged or fill material, into waters of the U.S. The CWA establishes in-stream water quality and treatment standards for wastewater discharges that are applied to wastewater dischargers through Section 402 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permits. Regular monitoring, as well as compliance with reporting requirements and performance standards, are preconditions for the issuance and renewal of Section 402 NPDES permits. Individual permits or general permits under Section 404 of the CWA are required to discharge dredged or fill materials into waters of the U.S. including wetlands, streams, and other areas meeting the regulatory definition. Expansion of EPA jurisdiction over these areas has the potential to adversely impact our operations. For example, the EPA released a final rule in May 2015 that attempted to clarify federal jurisdiction under the CWA over waters of the United States, but a number of legal challenges to this rule are pending, and implementation of the rule has been stayed nationwide. On January 13, 2017, the Supreme Court agreed to review the Sixth Circuit’s finding that it has jurisdiction to hear challenges to the rule. In February 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing EPA and the Corps to review the WOTUS definition and to publish a proposed rule rescinding or revising the rule. At present, we cannot predict the outcome of the pending litigation or any revisions to the rule. To the extent the rule expands the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. Our surface coal mining and preparation plant operations typically require such permits to authorize activities such as the creation of slurry ponds, stream impoundments, and valley fills. The EPA, or a state that has been delegated such authority by the EPA, issues NPDES permits for the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters, while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) issues dredge and fill permits under Section 404 of the CWA. Where Section 402 NPDES permitting authority has been delegated to a state, the EPA retains a limited oversight role. The CWA also gives the EPA an oversight role in the Section 404 permitting program, including drafting substantive rules governing permit issuance by the Corps, providing comments on proposed permits, and, in some cases, exercising the authority to delay or pre-empt Corps issuance of a Section 404 permit. The EPA has recently asserted these authorities more forcefully to question, delay, and prevent issuance of some Section 402 and 404 permits for surface coal mining in Appalachia. Currently, significant uncertainty exists regarding the obtaining of permits under the CWA for coal mining operations in Appalachia due to various initiatives launched by the EPA regarding these permits.
 
For instance, even though the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the State of West Virginia have been delegated the authority to issue NPDES permits for coal mines in those states, the EPA is taking a more active role in its review of NPDES permit applications for coal mining operations in Appalachia. The EPA issued final guidance on July 21, 2011 that encouraged EPA Regions 3, 4 and 5 to object to the issuance of state program NPDES permits where the Region does not believe that the proposed permit satisfies the requirements of the CWA and with regard to state issued general Section 404 permits, support the previously drafted Enhanced Coordination Process (“ECP”) among the EPA, the Corps, and the U.S. Department of the Interior for issuing Section 404 permits, whereby the EPA undertook a greater level of review of certain Section 404 permits than it had previously undertaken. The D.C. Circuit upheld EPA’s use of the ECP in July 2014. Future application of the ECP, such as may be enacted following notice and comment rulemaking, would have the potential to delay issuance of permits for surface coal mines, or to change the conditions or restrictions imposed in those permits.
 
The EPA also has statutory “veto” power under Section 404(c) to effectively revoke a previously issued Section 404 permit if the EPA determines, after notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, that the permit will have an “unacceptable adverse effect.” The Court have previously upheld the EPA’s ability to exercise this authority. Any future use of the EPA’s Section 404 “veto” power could create uncertainty with regard to our continued use of their current permits, as well as impose additional time and cost burdens on future operations, potentially adversely affecting our revenues.
 
The Corps is authorized to issue general “nationwide” permits for specific categories of activities that are similar in nature and that are determined to have minimal adverse environmental effects. We may no longer seek general permits under Nationwide Permit 21 (“NWP 21”) because in February 2012, the Corps reinstated the use of NWP 21, but limited application of NWP 21 authorizations to discharges with impacts not greater than a half-acre of water, including no more than 300 linear feet of streambed, and disallowed the use of NWP 21 for valley fills. This limitation remains in place in the new NWP 21 issued in January of 2017. If the newly issued NWP 21 cannot be used for any of our proposed surface coal mining projects, we will have to obtain individual permits from the Corps subject to the additional EPA measures discussed below with the uncertainties and delays attendant to that process.
 
We currently have a number of Section 404 permit applications pending with the Corps. Not all of these permit applications seek approval for valley fills or other obvious “fills”; some relate to other activities, such as mining through streams and the associated post-mining reconstruction efforts. We sought to prepare all pending permit applications consistent with the requirements of the Section 404 program. Our five year plan of mining operations does not rely on the issuance of these pending permit applications. However, the Section 404 permitting requirements are complex, and regulatory scrutiny of these applications, particularly in Appalachia, has increased such that our applications may not be granted or, alternatively, the Corps may require material changes to our proposed operations before it grants permits. While we will continue to pursue the issuance of these permits in the ordinary course of our operations, to the extent that the permitting process creates significant delay or limits our ability to pursue certain reserves beyond our current five year plan, our revenues may be negatively affected.

Total Maximum Daily Load (“TMDL”) regulations under the CWA establish a process to calculate the maximum amount of a pollutant that an impaired water body can receive and still meet state water quality standards, and to allocate pollutant loads among the point- and non-point pollutant sources discharging into that water body. Likewise, when water quality in a receiving stream is better than required, states are required to conduct an anti-degradation review before approving discharge permits. The adoption of new TMDLs and load allocations or any changes to anti-degradation policies for streams near our coal mines could limit our ability to obtain NPDES permits, require more costly water treatment, and adversely affect our coal production.
 
Hazardous Substances and Wastes
 
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws, impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liabilities for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Some products used by coal companies in operations generate waste containing hazardous substances. We are not aware of any material liability associated with the release or disposal of hazardous substances from our past or present mine sites.
 
The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and corresponding state laws regulating hazardous waste affect coal mining operations by imposing requirements for the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous wastes. Many mining wastes are excluded from the regulatory definition of hazardous wastes, and coal mining operations covered by SMCRA permits are by statute exempted from RCRA permitting. RCRA also allows the EPA to require corrective action at sites where there is a release of hazardous wastes. In addition, each state has its own laws regarding the proper management and disposal of waste material. While these laws impose ongoing compliance obligations, such costs are not believed to have a material impact on our operations.
 
In June 2010, EPA released a proposed rule to regulate the disposal of certain coal combustion by-products (“CCB”). The proposed rule sets forth two proposed avenues for the regulation of CCB under RCRA. The first option called for regulation of CCB under Subtitle C as a hazardous waste, which creates a comprehensive program of federally enforceable requirements for waste management and disposal. The second option called for regulation of CCB under Subtitle D as a solid waste, which gives EPA authority to set performance standards for solid waste management facilities and would be enforced primarily through state agencies and citizen suits. In December 2014, EPA finalized regulations that address the management of coal ash as a non-hazardous solid waste under Subtitle D. The rules impose engineering, structural and siting standards on surface impoundments and landfills that hold coal combustion wastes and mandate regular inspections. The rule also requires fugitive dust controls and imposes various monitoring, cleanup, and closure requirements. The rule leaves intact the Bevill exemption for beneficial uses of CCB, though it defers a final Bevill regulatory determination with respect to CCB that is disposed of in landfills or surface impoundments. Additionally, in December 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, which provides for the establishment of state and EPA permit programs for the control of coal combustion residuals and authorizes states to incorporate EPA’s final rule for coal combustion residuals or develop other criteria that are at least as protective as the final rule. The costs of complying with these new requirements may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, and could potentially increase our customers’ operating costs, thereby reducing their ability to purchase coal as a result. In addition, contamination caused by the past disposal of CCB, including coal ash, can lead to material liability to our customers under RCRA or other federal or state laws and potentially reduce the demand for coal.

Endangered Species Act
 
The federal Endangered Species Act and counterpart state legislation protect species threatened with possible extinction. Protection of threatened and endangered species may have the effect of prohibiting or delaying us from obtaining mining permits and may include restrictions on timber harvesting, road building and other mining or agricultural activities in areas containing the affected species or their habitats. A number of species indigenous to our properties are protected under the Endangered Species Act. Based on the species that have been identified to date and the current application of applicable laws and regulations, however, we do not believe there are any species protected under the Endangered Species Act that would materially and adversely affect our ability to mine coal from our properties in accordance with current mining plans.
Use of Explosives
 
We use explosives in connection with our surface mining activities. The Federal Safe Explosives Act (“SEA”) applies to all users of explosives. Knowing or willful violations of the SEA may result in fines, imprisonment, or both. In addition, violations of SEA may result in revocation of user permits and seizure or forfeiture of explosive materials.
 
The storage of explosives is also subject to regulatory requirements. For example, pursuant to a rule issued by the Department of Homeland Security in 2007, facilities in possession of chemicals of interest (including ammonium nitrate at certain threshold levels) are required to complete a screening review in order to help determine whether there is a high level of security risk, such that a security vulnerability assessment and a site security plan will be required. It is possible that our use of explosives in connection with blasting operations may subject us to the Department of Homeland Security’s new chemical facility security regulatory program.
 
The costs of compliance with these requirements should not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
In December 2014, OSM announced its decision to propose a rule that will address all blast generated fumes and toxic gases. OSM has not yet issued a proposed rule to address these blasts. We are unable to predict the impact, if any, of these actions by the OSM, although the actions potentially could result in additional delays and costs associated with our blasting operations.
 
Other Environmental and Mine Safety Laws
 
We are required to comply with numerous other federal, state and local environmental and mine safety laws and regulations in addition to those previously discussed. These additional laws include, for example, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. The costs of compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Employees
 
To carry out our operations, our general partner and our subsidiaries employed 570 full-time employees as of December 31, 2016. None of the employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we have good relations with these employees and since our inception we have had no history of work stoppages or union organizing campaigns.
