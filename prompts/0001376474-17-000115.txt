ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Company History
 
We were incorporated on April 19, 2004, and for much or our history were engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. We have shifted our focus during 2014 and are now an intellectual property company that owns patented and unpatented intellectual property. On August 28, 2014, we changed our name to MV Portfolios, Inc.
The MVP Acquisition
 
During 2014, we acquired 8 issued and 11 pending patents. The patents disclose systems and methods for providing video drive-by data to enable a street level view of a neighborhood surrounding a geographic location. The systems include, generally, a video and data server farm incorporating at least one video storage server that stores video image files containing video driver-by data corresponding to a geographic location, a data base server that processes a data query received from a user over the internet and an image processing server.
 
On February 7, 2014, we entered into a securities exchange agreement (the “Securities Exchange Agreement”) with MVP Portfolio, LLC (“MVP”), MV Patents, LLC (“MV PAT”), and the other members of MVP (MV PAT and such other members, the “Members”). Pursuant to the terms of the Securities Exchange Agreement, the Members sold all of their membership interests in MVP to us in exchange for 9,385,000 shares (the “MVP Exchange Shares”) of our post-Reverse Split (defined below) common stock to be issued following completion of the Reverse Split. As a result of the MVP Acquisition, we have acquired the business of MVP, that is, patent licensing and assertion of rights under patents against parties believed to be selling goods or services that rely upon MVP’s patented technology.
 
A summary of the MVP Acquisition and related transactions is discussed below.  For a more detailed discussion of the MVP Acquisition and the related transactions, reference is made to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 10, 2014, as amended.
 
Pursuant to the Securities Exchange Agreement:
 

● | At the closing of the MVP Acquisition and pursuant to the terms of the Securities Exchange Agreement, all of the membership interests of MVP issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing were exchanged (the "Securities Exchange") for the right to receive 9,385,000 post-Reverse Split shares of our common stock.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additionally, at the closing of the MVP Acquisition, we paid MV Patents, LLC, the majority member of MVP, $625,000 in cash consideration, and we agreed to pay to the members of MVP ten (10%) percent of the net proceeds to be received from any Enforcement Activities or Sale Transactions (as such terms are defined in the Securities Exchange Agreement) related to the patents owned or applications pending as of the closing of the MVP Acquisition.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Upon the closing of the MVP Acquisition, William Meadow was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Shea Ralph was appointed Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and director and David Rector was appointed Chief Operating Officer (who resigned on January 9, 2015). James Davidson resigned as Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company and Michael Baybak resigned as Interim Treasurer, Secretary and a director. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Following the closing of the MVP Acquisition, we expect to evaluate whether to terminate or split off our mining business (although we are not sure we will be able to complete such a split-off on acceptable terms to us), and pursuant to the terms of the Securities Exchange Agreement, we have acquired and will continue the business of MVP, that is, patent licensing and assertion of rights under patents against parties believed to be selling goods or services that rely upon MVP’s patented technology.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Concurrently with the closing of the MVP Acquisition, we sold to each of David Rector and William Meadow, ten thousand (10,000) shares, for an aggregate of twenty thousand (20,000) shares, of our to-be-authorized and designated Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series D Preferred Stock”) at a post-Reverse Split price of $0.10 per share. The Series D Preferred Stock will be equivalent in all respects to our common stock, except that each share of Series D Preferred Stock will be entitled to cast 1,000 votes per share and will have a liquidation preference equal to $0.10 per share. The sale of the Series D Preferred Stock is further discussed below.

The Securities Exchange Agreement contained customary representations and warranties and pre- and post-closing covenants of each party and customary closing conditions.  Breaches of the representations and warranties will be subject to customary indemnification provisions, subject to specified aggregate limits of liability.
 
For financial reporting purposes, the MVP Acquisition is being accounted for as a “reverse merger” rather than a business combination, because the managing member of MV PAT, the majority member of MVP, effectively controlled the Company immediately following the closing of the MVP Acquisition. As such, MVP is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and, consequently, the transaction is being treated as a reverse acquisition of the Company by MVP.  Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that will be reflected in the Company’s ongoing financial statements will be those of MVP.  For periods prior to the formation of MVP (July 26, 2013), MV PAT would be deemed the accounting acquirer.
 
The parties have taken all actions with respect to the Securities Exchange intending that it be treated as a tax-free exchange under Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. It is expected that the $625,000 in cash consideration paid to MV PAT will be treated as taxable income to MV PAT.
 
The issuance of shares of our common stock to the members of MVP in connection with the Securities Exchange was not, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act, in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, which exempts transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering, and Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under that section.  These securities may not be offered or sold absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirement, and are subject to further contractual restrictions on transfer as described below.
 
2014 10% Convertible Notes Private Placement Offering
 
Also on February 7, 2014, we completed a first closing of a related private placement offering (the “2014 Notes Offering”) of $2,942,495 in principal amount of our 10% convertible promissory notes (the “2014 Notes”).  The 2014 Notes sold in the first closing automatically converted into 5,581,547 shares, including shares issued as converted interest, of the Company’s Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series C Preferred Stock”), at a post-Reverse Split conversion price of $0.50 per share, upon the Company’s filing of a Certificate of Designation of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Series C Designation”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada following completion of the proposed Authorized Capital Increase (defined below) and the related filing of the Articles Amendments (defined below).
 
On March 3, 2014, we completed a second closing of the 2014 Notes Offering for gross proceeds of $1,017,500 (before deducting placement agent fees and expenses of the offering) of which $25,000 represented the settlement of outstanding legal fees.  The 2014 Notes sold in the March 3rd closing automatically converted on August 28, 2014 into 2,135,619 shares, including shares issued as converted interest, of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock.
 
Prior to August 28, 2014, the Company twice extended the maturity dates of the 2014 Notes. On May 30, 2014, the Company exercised its unilateral right as set forth in Section 1.04 of the 2014 Notes to extend the maturity dates of the 2014 Notes by 90 days. The other terms and conditions of the Notes remained unchanged. On August 11, 2014, the balance of the February 2014 Notes was reduced to $2,642,500 and the Company, the holders of the February 2014 Notes and the holders of the March 2014 Notes amended the 2014 Notes to extend the maturity dates of the Notes to November 2, 2014. Except for the amended maturity dates the terms and conditions of the 2014 Notes remained unchanged.
 
Each share of Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference equal to $0.001 per share.  Otherwise, the Series C Preferred Stock will be equivalent in all respects to the Company’s common stock, with each share of Series C Preferred stock entitled to one vote and the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock voting together with the holders of the Company’s common stock. The Series C Preferred Stock will be convertible on a one-for-one basis into shares of our common stock at the option of the holders, subject to a 9.99% blocker.
 
In connection with the 2014 Notes Offering, we agreed to pay the placement agent, Cavu Securities, LLC (“Cavu”), a cash commission of between 4% and 10% of the gross funds raised from Investors in the 2014 Notes Offering introduced by the placement agent, for a total of $295,150, and to issue to Cavu 250,000 post-Reverse Split shares of our common stock as a retainer fee (the “Retainer Shares”) and warrants (the “Broker Warrants”) to purchase 590,300 shares of our post-Reverse Split common stock. The Broker Warrants have a post-Reverse Split exercise price of $0.50 per share and expire three years after the date of issuance.
 
The Company provided the net proceeds from the 2014 Notes Offering to MVP to finance MVP’s business relating to the enforcement of its intellectual property rights through litigation against, and/or licensing with, any companies that are believed to be infringing certain of the patents owned by MVP. MVP expects to use the net proceeds from the 2014 Notes Offering to pay legal fees and costs relating to these planned litigations and licensing arrangements.

The Series D Preferred Stock
 
Concurrently with the closing of the Securities Exchange, we sold to each of David Rector and William Meadow, ten thousand (10,000) shares at a price of $0.10 per share (calculated on a post-Reverse Split basis) of our to be authorized and designated Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series D Preferred Stock"). The Series D Preferred Stock will be equivalent in all respects to the Common Stock, other than each share of Series D Preferred Stock will be entitled to cast 1,000 votes per share and will have a liquidation preference equal to $0.10 per share. Each share of Series D Preferred Stock will automatically convert into One (1) share of Common Stock on the earlier of: (i) the listing the Company's securities on a national securities exchange and (ii) a change of control of the Company. William Meadow delivered an irrevocable voting proxy to David Rector covering the shares of Series D Preferred Stock held by Meadow. These shares were assigned to Mr. Meadow upon Mr. Rector's resignation on Jan 09 2015. Mr. Rector assigned his 10,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock to Mr. Shea Ralph.
The Reverse Stock Split and Related Matters
 
On August 28, 2014, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to (i) effectuate a reverse stock split of its common stock with a reverse split ratio of one-for-one hundred (1:100) (the “Reverse Split”), (ii) increase its authorized capitalization from 300,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 22,000,000 share of blank check preferred stock, to 300,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Authorized Capital Increase”) and (iii) change its name to “MV Portfolios, Inc.” from “California Gold Corp.” (the Name Change).
 
The Name Change and the Reverse Split became effective for our principal market, the OTC Markets, Inc. QB Tier, upon approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) at which time a new trading symbol, “MPVI” became effective.
 
Description of MVP’s Business
 
MVP is engaged in the business of patent acquisition, product development, patent licensing and when necessary assertion of rights under patents against parties believed to be selling goods or services that rely upon our patented technology. MVP employees and consultants actively contact University Offices of Technology Licensing to review their inventory of existing patents and provisional filings available for license. If a patent or patent application appears to have commercial value once productized, MVP will invest to complete a more robust search for prior art. Once the prior art process in completed, MVP will contract with the University or patent owner to obtain an option for exclusive rights for a 6 to 12 month period. Once an option right is established, MVP will research the market and develop a business plan for angel investors.
 
The Company owns a patent portfolio we refer to as "Video Drive-by" and online mapping, which has previously been used by MVP's predecessors and licensees commercially. We currently own (through MVP) a patent portfolio consisting of 8 issued and 11 pending patents. The patents disclose systems and methods for providing video drive-by data to enable a street level view of a neighborhood surrounding a geographic location. The systems include, generally, a video and data server farm incorporating at least one video storage server that stores video image files containing video drive-by data corresponding to a geographic location, a data base server that processes a data query received from a user over the internet and an image processing server. Now that the Transactions have closed, MVP enforced its intellectual property rights through litigation against, and/or licensing with, any companies that are believed to be infringing certain of the patents owned by MVP. MVP expects to use net proceeds from the Private Placement to pay legal fees and costs relating to these planned litigations.
 
MVP provides a variety of operational services to its subsidiaries for its start-up subsidiaries. The Company has intercompany transfer agreements for service provided as well as intercompany loans.
 
We intend to attempt to maximize the economic benefits of our intellectual property portfolio, add significant talent in technological innovation, and potentially enhance our opportunities for revenue generation through the monetization of our assets, including patents owned by MVP.  Acquisitions typically involve the ongoing relationship of the original innovator(s) and owners to help in the continued development of the portfolio to maximize value.
 
We intend to expand our intellectual property portfolio through both internal development and acquisition.  We believe that our experience and ability to offer shares of our stock to inventors and others will enable us to expand our intellectual property portfolio as well as create additional intellectually property internally.
 
We continue to actively seek to broaden our intellectual property portfolio. Our philosophy is to seek and acquire intellectual property and technology. We are reviewing portfolio opportunities with a view toward acquiring those which we believe have potential for monetization through licensing opportunities or enforcement which may be related or unrelated to the Video Drive-by and online mapping patents. We are actively engaged in due diligence with respect to a number of patent and intellectual property

portfolios and are in discussions as to the acquisition of several such portfolios. On August 15, 2014, MVP signed an option agreement with Harvard University related to a dielectric elastomer innovation that has the potential to create digital smart phone images where all objects are in focus. The Company decided to not pursue productization of the diaelectric elastomer innovation in early 2015. We will likely need to raise additional capital to complete any such acquisition. There is no assurance that we will succeed in acquiring any such portfolios, as to the terms of any such acquisition or that we will successfully monetize any portfolio that we acquire.
 
Key Elements of Business Strategy
 
Our intellectual property acquisition, development and licensing business strategy will include the following key elements:
 

· Identify Emerging Growth Areas where Patented Technologies will Play a Vital Role 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Certain technologies become core technologies in the way products and services are manufactured, sold and delivered by companies across a wide array of industries. In conjunction with our partners, patent attorneys, and other patent sourcing professionals, we plan identify core, patented technologies that have been or are anticipated to be widely adopted by third parties in connection with the manufacture or sale of products and services.
 

· Contact and Form Alliances with Owners of Core, Patented Technologies 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Often individual inventors and small companies have limited resources and/or expertise and are unable to effectively address the unauthorized use of their patented technologies.  We will seek to enter into business agreements with owners of intellectual property that do not have experience or expertise in the areas of intellectual property licensing and enforcement, or that do not possess the in-house resources to devote to intellectual property licensing and enforcement activities, or that, for any number of strategic business reasons, desire to more efficiently and effectively outsource their intellectual property licensing and enforcement activities.
 

· Effectively and Efficiently Evaluate Patented Technologies for Acquisition, Licensing and Enforcement 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Subtleties in the language of a patent, recorded interactions with the patent office, and the evaluation of prior art can make a significant difference in the potential licensing and enforcement revenue derived from a patent or patent portfolio.  It is important to identify potential problem areas, if any, and determine whether potential problem areas can be overcome, prior to acquiring a patent portfolio or launching an effective licensing program.
 

· Purchase or Acquire the Rights to Patented Technologies 
----------------------------------------------------------

 
After evaluation, we may elect to purchase the patented technology, or acquire the exclusive right to license the patented technology in all or in specific fields of use.  The original owner of the patent or patent rights will typically receive an upfront acquisition payment or shares of common stock in the Company, or retain the right to a portion of the gross revenues generated from a patent portfolio’s licensing and enforcement program, or a combination of the two.
 

· Successfully License and Enforce Patents with Significant Royalty Potential 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As part of the patent evaluation process, significant consideration is also given to the identification of potential licenses, customers, infringers, industries within which the potential infringers exist, longevity of the patented technology, and a variety of other factors that directly impact the magnitude and potential success of a licensing, development and enforcement program. We are seeking to hire individuals trained in commercialization and in evaluating potentially infringing technologies and in presenting the claims of our patents and demonstrating how they apply to companies we believe are using our technologies in their products or services. These presentations can take place in a non-adversarial business setting, but can also occur through the litigation process, if necessary. Ultimately, we may will execute patent licensing arrangements with users of our patented technologies through licensing negotiations, without the filing of patent infringement litigation, or through the negotiation of license and settlement arrangements in connection with the filing of patent infringement litigation.
 
Business Update
 
On March 17, 2014, Visual Real Estate, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary and successor to MVP as a result of a corporate reorganization, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Google Inc. in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The lawsuit claims infringement of three of Visual Real Estate’s patents: U.S. Patent number 7,389,181, entitled “Apparatus and Method for Producing Video Drive-By Data Corresponding to a Geographic Location”; U.S. Patent number 7,929,800, entitled “Methods and Apparatus for Generating a Continuum of Image Data”; and U.S. Patent number 8,078,396, entitled “Methods for and Apparatus for Generating a Continuum of Three Dimensional Image Data.” Among other things, the complaint identifies Google Street

View and Google Earth as infringing Visual Real Estate’s patents. The case number is 3:14-cv-00274-TJC-PDB. On August 20, 2014, Google, Inc. filed four petitions for InterParties Review (“IPR”) before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) challenging our patent infringement claims. On January 25, 2016, the PTAB issued a final written decision on the IPR which was not favorable to the Company. The ruling, indicating that the claims were too broad, invalidated our most valuable claims. Therefore, we have dropped the law suit. We are in the process of determining if we want to pursue a second lawsuit with a tighter claim suit that speaks to the value of the additional damages that relate to having the very simple innovation that we brought to market of typing in an address and identifying a specific parcel location and picture of a property.
 
On November 20, 2014, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Flexine, Inc., which will explore productization potential from a patent from Harvard University for a novel material that may be used to create a unique variable focus lens for SmartPhone cameras.
 
On November 20, 2014, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, ResoCator, Inc., which will explore productization potential from a patent from the University of Oxford for a Miniature Atomic Clock (“MAC”). MV Portfolios, Inc. executed an option agreement for US Patent 82217724 with ISIS Innovations (University of Oxford’s patent licensing company). We have interest and nondisclosure agreements in place with several companies that recognize the potential of the MAC devices that will be capable of being created.
 
On April 25, 2015, the Company decided not to renew its leases with the Bureau of Mines relating to its portfolio of Nevada properties as it was no longer a focus of operations and a potential buyer for the leases was not identified. Therefore, CalGold de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. was liquidated. The Company reported a write off of $450,000 related to Mining Rights at December 31, 2014.
 
Subsidiary Operations
 
ResoCator, Inc. (“ResoCator”) was established to develop and market new technologies based on University of Oxford’s patented Miniature Atomic Clock (MAC). In July 2015, ResoCator acquired exclusive global rights for all fields of use to the Patent 8217724 / EP2171546B1. Following is an overview of the ResoCator operations.
Background: Clocks are an essential core component of all forms of computing and communications. GPS satellites using atomic clocks enable trilateration calculation of a terrestrial device location by measuring the time delay of arrival. (The speed of light is about 1 foot every billionth of a second.) Quartz clocks in computers help manage the processing that takes place on chip, on the circuit board and on its network. Radios in cell towers rely on atomic clocks to manage and coordinate the transmissions of multi gigahertz transmissions. All fiber optic networks use atomic clock timings for synchronization.
 
Unique Competitive Advantages: ResoCator’s MAC solves several problems that have existed for decades computing, communication and location based services. First, the MAC will require no standby power. Secondly, the MAC is indeed miniature and we believe the incremental space it will occupy on a chip will be less than 1mm2. Finally, the MAC will benefit from the extreme low cost of high volume wafer scale production. We recognize significant challenges in fully deploying the Oxford innovation and creating high volume products. To ResoCator’s knowledge, there are no other molecular species of the type described in the patent which deliver the spin properties and measurable phase-shift requisite for building a stable solid-state atomic clock device. Current small atomic clocks rely on a Cesium Ion cloud that needs constant power and a variety of complex supporting electronics to work.
 
Product Offerings: ResoCator when fully funded anticipates productizing and licensing MAC based technologies. The first location product family will be the “Global Resource Locator” (GRL) which is part of a suite of devices and services that will compete with GPS as well as many other interior “beacon based” location based technologies. GRL devices will enable highly accurate locating of any object, whenever radio waves from terrestrial cell towers and other RF sources exist, using on-board atomic clock based trilateration - with an anticipated drastic reduction in price, size and power consumption as compared to current atomic clock technology.
 
Sales and Marketing: ResoCator when fully funded anticipates building a small strategic licensing team focused on a targeted list of Strategic Partners. ResoCator intends to work with the Strategic Partners to integrate, productize and then license MAC enhanced products and services. Field of use and transaction based licenses will be offered for MAC chip designs, MAC chips, GRL devices, transaction servers (location, timing, communication, security, RF network access, etc.) and integrated into a variety of electronics such as IoT devices. Strategic Partners will provide expertise and access to their existing MEMS & CMOS design/production facilities, assembly operations, applications platforms, sales and marketing teams, and their distribution channels and end user customers.

 Phase 1: Develop production plan and functional first generation devices.
  Phase 2: Develop volume production based design and begin shipments.
 
Potential Product Uses: Nearly everyone on the planet now has a Smartphone device that can let them easily interoperate with other electronic devices. The Internet of Things concept represents thousands of device designs in hundreds of categories. ResoCator anticipates that it will be able to license the patent MAC and additional technology enhancements (GRLs) to a variety of strategic technology partners who can bring immediate market credibility, rapid productization and customers to adopt and enjoy the benefits. Management believes the unique molecular nature of this fundamental patent will provide both ResoCator, Inc. and our Strategic Partners strong long-term patent protection. Atomic clocks provide additional accuracy enabling, among other things, precise trilateration for measuring Time Delay of Arrival (TDOA) of radio signals, which move about 1 foot every billionth of a second. Atomic clocks are found in many core infrastructure systems every fiber optic network, high-end routers and cell towers. Most atomic clocks are priced in the $1,000 to $50,000 range. We believe our technology will be a dramatically lower and more importantly consume zero standby power.
Location Market Opportunity: GPS technology has achieved global penetration with revenue representing $27 billion across all markets. The MAC will enable location determination in nearly all locations (indoors and out) where people live, work and play. Management believes the global market for the indoor GRL technology is nearly as large as the GPS market. Currently, virtually no item or device can derive and store information on its location, both indoors and outdoors, without special transmitters or “beacon” located on-site. GRL technology will be able to do this without beacons. The opportunity is to replace GPS with GRL.
Potential Product Benefits: ResoCator anticipates that the MAC innovation, if successfully developed will enable a variety of new value propositions for a number of uses. The list below can be applied across multiple product types and industries.
 
1.

Mobile End Points: GRLs will be sensor-enabled mobile end points that can report on mission critical data. With GRL labels applied or built into items of any type, including consumables, wearables, high-value assets and day-to-day things like luggage and packaging. This means you have the ability to offer higher levels of real-time control and tracking, including things like data on when prescription vials or foods have been moved and the temperatures to which they have been exposed. 
 2.

Greater Efficiency: Having GRL location and condition data for billions of items throughout the entire life cycle opens opportunities to make the supporting ecosystem of third party companies and delivery services more efficient. 
 3.

Customer Service -Shipping Inquires: Any GRL tagged item will be able to be traced with virtually no human intervention. Inquires from customers about deliveries from shippers facilities or third parties, can be fully automated and dramatically more accurate. Users will touch their app to see where any delivery is, in real time. Authorized parties in the ecosystem will have location, temperature and humidity information about any delivery upon request. 
 4.

Reduced Theft: As the world learns that products embedded GRLs publish their location and devices with the app act as transmission bridges the volume of stolen goods will be dramatically reduced. 
 5.

Payment Triggers: GRL services could facilitate authentication and confirmation of payment transactions by tracking the physical location of any individual allowing payment for certain items to occur when they have entered a delivery point. 
 6.

Reorder: Post-delivery, goods and containers with tactile based I/O GRL tags can act as simple instant consumer re-order devices as well as providing expiration and environmental updates on items such as foods, or medicine. 
 7.

Integration with Third party sellers: UUID encoded GRLs affixed to label rolls will allow for easy attachment to existing products or containers. Shippers can offer full inventory tracking throughout a 3rd party’s products life cycle. 
 8.

Leading Near-Term Transformation: As GRLs are rapidly added to more and more items they will enhance business processes. Companies can provide customers entire suites of information processing applications across all types of computing platforms now and for years to come. 
 
Location Market: ResoCator anticipates that many product suites and associated services will be built around the GRL technology. We believe the mature GPS device marketplace and the rapidly growing indoor location technologies markets may offer a huge list of Use Case Scenarios where the MAC can transform and impact human behavior on a global scale. For example, the GRL devices will be capable of being embedded into credit cards, cell phones, consumer electronics, prescription bottle labels, shipping labels, product packaging, product labels, government & other organizations ID's, high value assets, and clothing.

Chip Development: ResoCator has researched, conferred and met a number of independent MicroElectro Mechanical System (MEMS) and CMOS IC designers, fabless design facilities, Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs), and foundries. It will take several designers each with specific skills to collaborate on the chip design. ResoCator is currently in discussions with MEMS designers, MEMS/CMOS design firms, short run wafer fabrication and packaging facilities. Upon completion of additional funding, for which we have no commitments ResoCator will engage the designers with the foundry to start the design and production planning process. The first products will be a MAC chip and MAC design added to an existing IoT device to create a GRL. It is anticipated that several design, build, test cycles will be required to develop a functional, scalable high volume MAC chip design. Every MEMS and CMOS based IC function described in the GRL device features (excluding the MAC component) is "off the shelf" and proven in high volume environments from several suppliers. The long term cost of chips is based on the amount of real estate on the wafer and the number of steps involved. Our MAC will require more steps than most IC chips and MEMS chips but this most likely not impact product pricing significantly. RFID tag can now be built for a few pennies today, some devices are fractions of a penny in volume. ResoCator currently anticipates that the longer term (several years) costs will be in line with other ultra-low cost technologies like RFID tags and NFC chips (near field communication, found on debit cards around the world).
Strategic Partner Complementary Technologies: ResoCator intends to utilize the combined resources of its Strategic Partners to solve problems in a timely manner. Our partners will provide expertise and support in the following areas:
 MEMS Atomic Clock, MEMS Sensors & Antennas, CMOS Design, CMOS and MEMS Foundries, Security Frameworks: Key generation, authentication systems, provisioning, Database design & profiling, Transaction processing platforms, Marketing and advertising analytics, Consumer & Medical products, Geospatial Systems, Defense & Government systems,
 Radio communications infrastructure and Device manufacturing. GRL technology will also be able to collect, store and transmit information other than location for each uniquely coded GRL – this will include environmental data (e.g. temperature, pressure, humidity) and motion using a postage-stamp size device. ResoCator has filed for patent protection for GRL and related inventions, which typically include the patented Miniature Atomic Clock technology. ResoCator plans to develop a platform that can be used across a wide variety of industries to enable electronics to securely store, publish and respond to location based and other queries.
 
Intellectual Property Development: ResoCator intends to invest in the expansion of the existing patent portfolio. ResoCator secured an exclusive option from Oxford University’s patent licensing company for the core invention of the Miniature Atomic Clock (USPTO 8217724 and EP2171546B1 PCT GB2008/002229). This invention makes feasible the creation of a wide variety of novel methods as part of an innovative Miniature Atomic Clock enabled methods and apparatus. William D. Meadow has filed patent applications on January 5th (USPTO# 15-62100033), on February 18th (USPTO# 15-62117946) and on July 07th (USPTO# 15-62189427) that includes the concepts and product offerings presented in this plan. Mr. Meadow, Oxford University as well as other Universities and inventors will receive royalties, commissions and equity in consideration for contributing their intellectual property rights.
 
ResoCator will work with Strategic Partners to develop a set of products (chips and chip designs etc.) that can be affixed onto or embedded into their existing products. As the products are developed and deployed, ResoCator will also develop with our Strategic Partners a set of transactional services and software apps that complement and enable uses around the world to obtain maximum value from their MAC enabled products. ResoCator anticipates establishing agreements with founding Strategic Partners in non-competitive markets to develop and commercialize the Miniature Atomic Clock.
 
Competition
 
We expect to encounter significant competition in our new line of business from others seeking to commercialize, acquire, license and develop their intellectual property assets. Most of our competitors have much longer operating histories, and significantly greater financial and human resources, than we do. Entities such as Document Security Systems, Inc., Vringo, Inc., VirnetX Holding Corp. Acacia Research Corporation, Allied Security Trust, Altitude Capital Partners, Augme Technologies Inc. Intellectual Ventures, Ocean Tomo, RPX Corporation, Rembrandt IP Management and others presently market themselves as being in the business of creating, acquiring, licensing or leveraging the value of intellectual property assets. We expect others to enter the market. In addition, competitors may seek to acquire the same or similar patents and technologies that we may seek to acquire, making it more difficult for us to realize the value of our assets which may be the result of the inability or unwillingness of third parties to also grant licenses to parties without the cooperation of the owners of other infringed rights.
Research and Development Expenditures
 
We have incurred no research and development expenditures over the last fiscal year and do not anticipate significant future research and development expenditures.

Offices
 
Effective August 31, 2013, we terminated our services agreement with Incorporated Communications Services (“ICS”), to reduce our corporate overhead relating to certain administrative costs.  Under this agreement, ICS had provided, among other things, our corporate headquarter offices at 4515 Ocean View Blvd, La Canada, CA.  From that date until the closing of the MVP Acquisition, we utilized the offices of our legal counsel, Gottbetter & Partners, LLP, 488 Madison Avenue, 12 th Floor, New York, NY 10022, as our corporate headquarters address.  Effective as of the date of the Securities Exchange, our principal offices are located at 10752 Deerwood Park Blvd., S. Waterview II, Suite 100, Jacksonville, FL 32256, phone (904)-586-8673.  Our website address is www.mvportfolios.com.
Subsidiaries
 
As of Jun 30, 2015 we have three subsidiaries:
 
(i) Visual Real Estate, Inc., our patent holding entity.
 
(ii) On November 20, 2014, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Flexine, Inc., which will explore productization potential from a patent from Harvard University for a novel material that may be used to create a unique variable focus lens for SmartPhone cameras.
 
(iii) On November 20, 2014, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, ResoCator, Inc., which will explore productization potential from a patent from the University of Oxford for a Miniature atomic Clock. MV Portfolios, Inc. has signed an option agreement for US Patent 82217724 with ISIS Innovations (University of Oxford’s patent licensing company).
 
On April 25, 2015, the Company decided not to renew its leases with the Bureau of Mines relating to its portfolio of Nevada properties as it was no longer a focus of operations and a potential buyer for the leases was not identified. Therefore, CalGold de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. was liquidated. The Company reported a write off of $450,000 related to Mining Rights at December 31, 2014.
 
Intellectual Property and Patent Rights
 
Our intellectual property will primarily be comprised of trade secrets, patented know-how, issued and pending patents, copyrights and technological innovation.
 
As a result of closing the Securities Exchange, we own a portfolio comprised of approximately 8 patents in the United States and 4 pending patent applications.
 
On November 16, 2015 SiberLaw LLP filed for a default judgement against Visual Real Estate, Inc. for a liquidated amount of $146,736.43. The Duval county Florida court ruled in SiberLaw's favor, and the amount recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. SiberLaw registered a lien at the US Patent Trademark Office for all patents owned by the Company's subsidiary Visual Real Estate Inc. These patents relate to Video Drive By family of patents including US Patents 7389181, 7929800, 8078396, 8090633, 8207964, 8213743, 8558848, 8554015.
