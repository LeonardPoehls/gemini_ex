BUSINESS
Our Business
SPX FLOW, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (“SPX FLOW,” ‘‘the Company,’’ “we,” “us,” or “our”) were wholly-owned by SPX Corporation (the “former Parent”) until September 26, 2015, at which time the former Parent distributed 100% of our outstanding common stock to its shareholders through a tax-free spin-off transaction (the “Spin-Off”).  Since that time we have been an independent, publicly-traded company on the NYSE under the ticker symbol FLOW. 
We are a global supplier of highly specialized, engineered solutions with approximately 7,000 employees, operations in over 30 countries and sales in over 150 countries around the world.  We innovate with customers to help feed and enhance the world by designing, delivering and servicing high value solutions at the heart of growing and sustaining our diverse communities.  We aspire to be a worldwide leader in sustainable solutions which ensure the controlled and measured movements of life’s essential elements.  
Our total revenue in 2017 was $2.0 billion, with approximately 40%, 37%, and 23% from sales into the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions, respectively. We report our business results in three segments:  Food and Beverage, Power and Energy and Industrial.  In 2017, 37% of our revenues were reported in our Food and Beverage reportable segment, 35% of revenues were reported in our Industrial reportable segment and 28% of revenues were reported in our Power and Energy reportable segment.
Our product portfolio of pumps, valves, mixers, filters, air dryers, hydraulic tools, homogenizers, separators and heat exchangers, along with the related aftermarket parts and services, supports global industries, including food and beverage, oil and gas, power generation (including nuclear and conventional), chemical processing, compressed air and mining. Our products 
1

are used across a variety of severe duty and high standard customer applications as well as certain highly regulated environments such as sanitary processing and nuclear power applications.  
Our core strengths include expertise in rotating, actuating and hydraulic equipment, a highly skilled workforce, global capabilities, product breadth, and a deep application knowledge that enables us to optimize configuration and create custom-engineered solutions for diverse processes.  
Between 2015 and 2017 we executed a multi-year, global realignment plan to transition our organization to an operating structure, improve our competitive position and increase our ability to serve customers. As part of this plan, we optimized our global footprint by consolidating eight manufacturing sites and a shared service center.  In addition, we improved our capabilities in high value countries, streamlined several business processes and reduced selling, general and administrative expense across our support functions. The majority of the improvements tied to the global realignment program are structural in nature to allow us to operate at a lower cost structure and more efficiently.
                We have aligned our segment teams to focus primarily on developing intimate customer relationships and expanding our relevance to customers within each end market.  The key areas our end market teams are emphasizing include (i) product management, (ii) channel development, (iii) localization and (iv) project execution and delivery. We made substantial progress in these areas during 2016 and 2017. Our ultimate goal was to create a more customer-centric, service-oriented organization and deliver greater value to our customers, investors and employees.
REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
Our business is organized into three reportable segments — Food and Beverage, Power and Energy and Industrial. The following summary describes the products and services offered by each of our reportable segments:
Food and Beverage:  Our Food and Beverage reportable segment had revenues of $715.9, $728.3, and $869.8 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and backlog of $371.7 and $295.7 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Acquisitions
We did not acquire any businesses in 2017. As part of our long-term strategy, we plan to evaluate potential acquisitions that (a) are complementary to our existing products and services, (b) increase our relevance to customers and our capabilities to serve them, (c) expand our global capabilities and accelerate our localization strategy and (d) expand our end market reach.
International Operations
We are a multinational corporation with operations in over 30 countries. Sales outside the United States were $1,258.5, $1,298.8 and $1,552.0 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
See Note 4 to our consolidated and combined financial statements for more information on our international operations. 
Research and Development
We are actively engaged in research and development programs designed to improve existing products and manufacturing methods and to develop new products to better serve our current and future customers. We place particular emphasis on the development of new products that are compatible with, and build upon, our manufacturing and marketing capabilities. We expensed $17.4, $19.4 and $19.1 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of research activities relating to the development and improvement of our products. 
Intellectual Property
We own approximately 153 domestic and 271 foreign patents, including 58 patents that were issued in 2017, covering a variety of our products and manufacturing methods. We also own a number of registered trademarks. Although in the aggregate our patents and trademarks are of considerable importance in the operation of our business, we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of such importance that its absence would adversely affect our ability to conduct business as presently constituted. We are both a licensor and licensee of patents. For more information, please refer to "Risk Factors." 
Raw Materials
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, including steel, titanium, nickel and petroleum-based products. Where appropriate, we may enter into long-term supply arrangements or fixed-cost contracts to lower the overall cost of raw materials. In addition, due to our diverse product and service offering, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the raw materials needed in our operations. However, we are not dependent on any one supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Lastly, we continue to centralize certain aspects of supply chain management in an effort to ensure adequate materials are available for production at low cost.
Competition
The markets we serve are highly competitive and fragmented. Our competitors are diverse, ranging from large multi-nationals to regional and local companies. Our principal global competitors include Alfa Laval AB, Flowserve Corporation, GEA Group AG, IDEX Corporation, ITT Goulds Pumps, Sulzer Ltd., and Tetra Pak International S.A. We do not have any one competitor with all the same product offerings, nor do we have any one competitor which serves all the same end markets. 
Our ability to compete effectively depends on a variety of factors including breadth of product offering, product quality, engineering strength, brand reputation, lead times, global capabilities, service capabilities, and cost. As many of our products are sold through distributors and independent representatives, our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network. 
Environmental Matters
See "MD&A — Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates — Contingent Liabilities," "Risk Factors" and Note 13 to our consolidated and combined financial statements for information regarding environmental matters. 
Employment 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 7,000 employees. Less than 1% of our U.S. employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements, while certain of our non-U.S. employee groups are covered by various collective labor 
3

arrangements. While we generally have experienced satisfactory labor relations, we are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. 
Executive Officers 
See Part III, Item 10 of this report for information about our executive officers. 
Other Matters 
No customer or group of customers that, to our knowledge, are under common control, accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated and combined revenues for any period presented. 
Our businesses maintain sufficient levels of working capital to support customer requirements, particularly inventory. We believe our businesses' sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors. 
The financial results of many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets they serve. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. In aggregate, our businesses tend to be stronger in the second half of the calendar year. Additionally, timing of revenue recognition on large Food and Beverage systems projects, Power and Energy projects and large Industrial orders may cause significant fluctuations in financial performance from period to period.
