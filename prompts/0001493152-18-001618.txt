ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Andina Acquisition Corp. II (the “Company” or “we”) is a blank check company formed on July 1, 2015 to acquire, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, plan of arrangement, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, one or more businesses or entities. The Company’s efforts in identifying a prospective target businesses are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region of the world.
 
On December 1, 2015, we closed our initial public offering of 4,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $40.0 million. Each unit consists of one ordinary share, par value $.0001 per share (“Ordinary Share”), one right (“Right”) to receive one-seventh of one Ordinary Share upon consummation of an initial business combination and one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”) entitling the holder to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per full share commencing on the consummation of an initial business combination. Simultaneous with the consummation of the initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of 310,000 private Units (“Private Placement Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating total proceeds of $3,100,000. The Private Placement Units were purchased by the Company’s shareholders prior to the initial public offering (the “initial shareholders”) and their affiliates and designees and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the representative of the underwriters in the initial public offering.
 
Following the consummation of the initial public offering, the underwriters notified the Company that they would not be exercising the over-allotment option. As a result, the initial shareholders had 150,000 ordinary shares held by them compulsorily repurchased by the Company for an aggregate purchase price of $0.01 so that they collectively owned 20.0% of the Company’s issued and outstanding ordinary shares after the initial public offering (not including the Ordinary Shares underlying the Private Placement Units (“Private Shares”)).The Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association originally contemplated that the Company had until September 1, 2017 to complete an initial business combination. On August 30, 2017, the Company’s shareholders approved an extension of the time to complete a business combination to November 1, 2017 (“First Extension”). At the meeting to approve such extension, public shareholders holding 432,769 shares converted their shares for their pro rata share of the funds in the trust account aggregating approximately $4.4 million, leaving 3,567,231 public shares outstanding and approximately $36.4 million in the trust account. On October 31, 2017, the Company’s shareholders approved a second extension of time to complete a business combination to February 1, 2018 (“Second Extension”). At this second meeting, public shareholders holding 727,300 shares converted their shares for their pro rata share of the funds in the trust account aggregating approximately $7.4 million, leaving 2,839,931 public shares outstanding and approximately $29.2 million in the trust account. On January 31, 2018, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders. At the meeting, the shareholders approved to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination to April 1, 2018 (“Third Extension”). Public shareholders holding 708,052 shares converted their shares for their pro rata share of the funds in the trust account aggregating approximately $7.3 million (or $10.30 per share), leaving 2,131,879 public shares outstanding and approximately $22 million in the trust account. The Company now has until April 1, 2018 to complete an initial business combination.
 
On October 27, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, Andina II Holdco Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Holdco”), Andina II Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (“Merger Sub”), Lazy Days’ R.V. Center, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Lazydays”), and, solely for certain purposes set forth in the Merger Agreement, A. Lorne Weil, an individual (“Weil”). Lazydays operates recreational vehicle dealerships in Seffner, FL, Tucson, AZ and Loveland, Denver and Longmont, CO. Lazydays carries more than 2,500 new and pre-owned recreational vehicles, and also has over 300 service bays and two on-site campgrounds with over 700 recreational vehicle campsites. Lazydays welcomes over 500,000 visitors annually, and employs over 700 people in its facilities.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (a) the Company will merge with and into Holdco, with Holdco surviving and becoming a new public company and (b) Merger Sub will merge with and into Lazydays, with Lazydays surviving and becoming a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco.
 
The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are subject to the approval of the shareholders of the Company and Lazydays and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions, as described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 30, 2017 (the “Merger Form 8-K”) and in the Merger Agreement.
 
The description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby contained in the Merger Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Effecting a Business Combination
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. Our board of directors determined that this test was met in connection with the proposed business combination with Lazydays..

Business Combination Procedures
 
In connection with the proposed business combination with Lazydays, we will seek shareholder approval of such initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as described below, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account in connection with a proposed business combination. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. Our initial shareholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of the proposed business combination with Lazydays and (2) not to convert any ordinary shares owned by them in connection with a shareholder vote to approve the proposed initial business combination with Lazydays.
Conversion Rights
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public shareholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. In such event, the conversion rights will be effected under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and Cayman Islands law as repurchases. A holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his shares.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to 20% or more of the ordinary shares sold in our initial public offering. Accordingly, all shares in excess of 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering held by a holder will not be converted to cash. We believe this restriction will prevent shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares before the vote held to approve a proposed business combination and attempt to use the conversion right as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then current market price. By limiting a shareholder’s ability to convert no more than 20% of the ordinary shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we have limited the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block a transaction which is favored by our other public shareholders.
 
Our initial shareholders will not have conversion rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to our initial public offering or purchased by them in our initial public offering or in the aftermarket. EarlyBirdCapital will not have conversion rights with respect to the shares included in the Private Placement Units, or “private shares.”
 
We will also require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent at any time through the vote on the business combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. Once the shares are converted by the beneficial holder, and effectively repurchased by us under Cayman Island law, the transfer agent will then update our Register of Shareholders to reflect all conversions. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to shareholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will further describe these delivery requirements. Accordingly, a shareholder would have from the time the shareholder received our proxy statement through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we are required to provide at least 5 days’ advance notice of any shareholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a shareholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders seeking to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.
 
Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.

Automatic Liquidation of Trust Account if No Business Combination
 
If we do not complete a business combination by April 1, 2018 (or such later date as may be approved by our shareholders), it will trigger our automatic winding up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. As a result, this has the same effect as if we had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under the Companies Law. Accordingly, no vote would be required from our shareholders to commence such a voluntary winding up, dissolution and liquidation.
 
The amount in the trust account (less $284 representing the aggregate nominal par value of the shares of our public shareholders) under the Companies Law will be treated as share premium which is distributable under the Cayman Companies Law provided that immediately following the date on which the proposed distribution is proposed to be made, we are able to pay our debts as they come due in the ordinary course of business. If we are forced to liquidate the trust account, we anticipate that we would distribute to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date (including any accrued interest). Prior to such distribution, we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts, as creditors take priority over our public shareholders with respect to amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation. Furthermore, while we will seek to have all vendors and service providers (which would include any third parties we engaged to assist us in any way in connection with our search for a target business) and prospective target businesses execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account or that a court would conclude that such agreements are legally enforceable.
 
Each of our initial shareholders has agreed to waive its rights to participate in any liquidation of our trust account or other assets with respect to the insider shares and private shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our rights or warrants, which will expire worthless.
 
If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share distribution from the trust account would be approximately $10.23 as of November 30, 2017.
 
The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would be prior to the claims of our public shareholders. Although we will seek to have all vendors, including lenders for money borrowed, prospective target businesses or other entities we engage execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refused to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, we would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to us if we chose not to engage such third party and evaluate if such engagement would be in the best interest of our shareholders if such third party refused to waive such claims. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. In any event, our management would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and would only enter into an agreement with a third party that did not execute a waiver if management believed that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason.
 
B. Luke Weil, one of our directors and non-executive Chairman of the Board, has agreed that, if we liquidate the trust account prior to the consummation of a business combination, he will be personally liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us in excess of the net proceeds of our initial public offering not held in the trust account, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that such debts or obligations do not reduce the amounts in the trust account and only if such parties have not executed a waiver agreement. However, we cannot assure you that Mr. Weil will be able to satisfy those obligations if it is required to do so. Accordingly, the actual per-share distribution could be less than $10.23, plus interest, due to claims of creditors. Additionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public shareholders at least $10.23 per share.

Competition
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination with Lazydays, there will be, in all likelihood, significant competition from its competitors. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively. Information regarding Lazydays’ competition will be set forth in the proxy statement for the meeting to be called to approve the business combination and in other future filings.
 
Prior to the completion of a business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors.
 
Employees
 
We have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of the business combination with Lazydays.
