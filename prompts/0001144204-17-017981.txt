General
 
Cadus Corporation (“Cadus”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in January 1992 and initially devoted substantially all of its resources to the development and application of novel yeast-based and other drug discovery technologies. Cadus no longer seeks to develop, maintain or license its drug discovery technologies. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, Cadus began to explore opportunities to profit from purchasing land and residential homes for construction or renovation and resale in areas of the United States where there may be increases in real estate value. Cadus then formed directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries (such subsidiaries together with Cadus Technologies, Inc. which holds the intellectual property associated with the Company’s prior business, the “Subsidiaries,” and Cadus together with its Subsidiaries, the “Company”) through which it would purchase individual homes and individual residential lots for purposes of renovation or construction and resale. Cadus’ corporate web site may be found at www.caduscorp.com.
 
The Company has predominantly concentrated its real estate acquisition, renovation and construction activities in south Florida. The Company bought its first residential properties in Florida in February 2014. As of March 15, 2017, the Company had purchased and continued to own twelve single-family residential zoned properties in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The majority of the properties are waterfront properties. In addition, the Company has purchased and continues to own an approximately one-acre single-family residential zoned vacant lot in East Hampton, New York.
 
Of its twelve properties in Miami-Dade County, ten are slated for the construction of new single-family homes, although certain of these properties may be sold without undertaking construction, and two properties have been renovated.
 
The Company conducted a rights offering for the issuance of up to 13,144,040 shares of its common stock pursuant to its S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that became effective April 28, 2014. In connection with the rights offering, the Company distributed to the holders of its common stock non-transferable subscription rights to purchase up to 13,144,040 shares of its common stock at $1.53 per share. Effective June 6, 2014, all 13,144,040 shares available in the offering were subscribed and the company received gross proceeds of $20,110,381 less offering costs of approximately $263,300. The Company is using the proceeds from the offering for, among other things, the acquisition, renovation, and construction of properties as well as for maintenance, property tax and other costs connected with its inventory of properties.
 
Depending on the availability of transactions acceptable to Cadus, all of Cadus’ available cash may be utilized, and Cadus may seek debt or equity financing. Although no such acquisitions or investments are currently contemplated, Cadus may also consider other acquisitions or investments in various industries.

Industry Overview and Current Market Conditions
 
The sale of homes has been and will likely remain a large industry in the United States for four primary reasons: historical growth in both population and households, demographic patterns that indicate an increased likelihood of home ownership as age and income increase, job creation within geographic markets that necessitate new home construction or the renovation of existing homes, and consumer demand for home features in new or renovated homes.
 
In any year, the demand for homes is closely tied to job growth, the availability and cost of mortgage financing, the supply of new and existing homes for sale and, importantly, consumer confidence. Consumer confidence is perhaps the most important of these demand variables and is the hardest one to predict accurately because it is a function of, among other things, consumers' views of their employment and income prospects, recent and likely future home price trends, localized new and existing home inventory, the level of current and near-term interest and mortgage rates, the availability of consumer credit, valuations in stock and bond markets, and other geopolitical factors. In general, high levels of employment, significant affordability and low new home and resale home inventories contribute to a strong and growing home renovation and homebuilding market environment.
 
While the Company believes that long-term fundamentals for home renovation and new home construction remain intact, it does not believe market conditions in Miami-Dade County, Florida are currently favorable for sellers of residential properties. This assessment is based upon a review of recent comparisons of listed prices for properties in the county and the prices at which they actually sell, the prevalence of price reductions for listed homes, the length of time properties remain on the market, and feedback received from local brokers. In addition, the Company is seeing a rise in construction costs.
 
Property Acquisition
 
In connection with the Company’s program to purchase residential properties for purposes of renovation or construction and resale, as of March 15, 2017, the Company has purchased for an aggregate original purchase price of approximately $29.9 million, and continues to own, through two indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, twelve residential properties in Miami-Dade County, Florida and one residential property in East Hampton, New York. Of the properties in Miami-Dade County, when purchased, eight properties had existing homes on them and three properties were vacant lots (one of which, 700 88th Street, Surfside, Florida) was subsequently subdivided into two equal lots). The Company does not currently intend to purchase additional properties until it has sold sufficient properties from its existing inventory of properties. To date, with the exception of the East Hampton property, the Company has concentrated its real estate activities in Miami-Dade County, Florida.

Demolition, Construction and Renovation
 
When individual homes are purchased, Cadus intends, as appropriate, to renovate them for resale or to demolish them for new home construction. When vacant lots are purchased, Cadus intends to construct new homes on them. In some cases, the Company may resell acquired land without undertaking construction.
 
As of March 15, 2017, the Company’s existing inventory or properties consisted of twelve residential properties in Miami-Dade County, Florida and one property in East Hampton, New York at the following addresses: (i) 700 88th Street, Surfside, FL 33154; (ii) 88th Street, Surfside, FL 33154 (this lot currently does not have its own street address, but has a folio number); (iii) 1420 Biscaya Drive, Surfside, FL 33154; (iv) 1211 Stillwater Drive, Miami Beach, FL 33141; (v) 2535 Shelter Avenue, Miami Beach, FL 33140; (vi) 2555 Shelter Avenue, Miami Beach, FL 33140; (vii) 11400 N. Bayshore Drive, North Miami, FL 33181; (viii) 11404 N. Bay Shore Drive, North Miami, FL 33181; (ix) 241 Atlantic Isle, Sunny Isles Beach, FL 33160 and the adjacent island which has its own folio number; (x) 18970 North Bay Road, Sunny Isles Beach, FL 33160; (xi) 3506 Main Lodge Drive, Coconut Grove, FL 33133; (xii) 3437 N. Moorings Way, Miami, FL 33133; and (xiii) 65 East Hollow Road, East Hampton, NY 11937. As of that date, all were vacant lots, except for two properties where the renovation of the existing homes have been completed and except for one of the properties where a home is under construction, and a number of properties had been listed for sale.
 
The Company engaged the architectural firm of Max Strang Architecture, Inc. for schematic designs (including floor plans, design renderings and construction budgets), which they completed, and other architectural services with respect to homes to be built on the Company’s current Florida properties. Renderings of proposed construction on certain of the Company’s properties may be found at the Company’s web site: www.caduscorp.com. As the Company sells homes into the market, its plan, depending on market conditions, is to begin construction on spec or custom homes on other of its properties.
 
Competition
 
The business of developing and selling residential properties is highly competitive and fragmented. The Company’s long-term success depends on its ability to acquire at reasonable prices existing residential properties suitable for renovation or construction and resale. The acquisition of residential homes and lots for renovation or construction and resale is highly competitive. In addition, the Company anticipates that it will compete for residential sales on the basis of a number of interrelated factors, including location, reputation, amenities, design, quality and price, with numerous large and small homebuilders, including some homebuilders with nationwide operations and much greater financial resources and/or lower costs than the Company. The Company will also compete for residential sales with individual resales of existing homes and available rental housing.
