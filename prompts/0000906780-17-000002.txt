Overview
Empire Resorts, Inc. (“Empire,” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “us,” “our” or “we”) was organized as a Delaware corporation on March 19, 1993, and since that time has served as a holding company for various subsidiaries engaged in the hospitality and gaming industries. 
 On December 21, 2015, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Montreign Operating Company, LLC ("Montreign Operating"), was awarded a gaming license (a "Gaming Facility License") by the New York State Gaming Commission ("NYSGC") to operate a resort casino (the "Casino Project") to be located at the site of a four-season destination resort being developed in the Town of Thompson in Sullivan County, approximately 90 miles from New York City (the "Destination Resort"), which is described below. Montreign Operating is the sole holder of a Gaming Facility License in the Hudson Valley-Catskill Area, which consists of Columbia, Delaware, Dutchess, Greene, Orange, Sullivan and Ulster counties in New York State. The Gaming Facility License became effective on March 1, 2016.
The Destination Resort is located on approximately 1,700 acres (the “EPT Property”) owned by EPT Concord II, LLC (“EPT”) and EPR Concord II, L.P. (“EPR LP”), two wholly-owned subsidiaries of EPR Properties, an entity unrelated to the Company. The Casino Project is part of the initial phase of the Destination Resort, which will also include an Indoor Waterpark Lodge (the "Waterpark"), a Rees Jones-redesigned "Monster" Golf Course (the "Golf Course Project") and an Entertainment Village, which will include hotel, retail, restaurants and other amenities (the "Entertainment Village Project" and, together with the Casino Project and the Golf Course Project, the "Development Projects"). In addition to the Casino Project, subsidiaries of Montreign Operating are responsible for developing the Entertainment Village Project and the Golf Course Project. Subsidiaries of EPR Properties are responsible for developing the Waterpark.
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Monticello Raceway Management, Inc. ("MRMI"), we currently own and operate Monticello Casino and Raceway, a 45,000-square foot video gaming machine ("VGM") and harness horseracing facility located in Monticello, New York, approximately 90 miles northwest of New York City. Monticello Casino and Raceway operates 1,110 VGMs, which includes 1,070 video lottery terminals ("VLTs") and 40 electronic table game positions ("ETGs"). VGMs are similar to slot machines, but they are connected to a central system and report financial information to the central system. ETGs include the games of roulette, blackjack and 3-card poker. We also generate racing revenues through pari-mutuel wagering on the running of live harness horse races, the import simulcasting of harness and thoroughbred horse races from racetracks across the country and internationally, and the export simulcasting of our races to offsite pari-mutuel wagering facilities. 
In a letter dated December 23, 2016, the NYSGC approved MRMI's racetrack and simulcast license renewal applications for calendar year 2017. Generally, the annual license renewal process requires the NYSGC to review the financial responsibility, experience, character and general fitness of MRMI and its management.

Recent Events
Corporate Restructuring
In January 2017, the Company undertook certain corporate restructuring. In particular, Empire created Montreign Holding Company, LLC ("Montreign Holding"), a wholly-owned subsidiary, to which it contributed all of its membership interests in Montreign Operating, which was formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Empire. Concurrently, Empire contributed to Montreign Operating all of its membership interests in each of Empire Resorts Real Estate I, LLC ("ERREI"), which is developing the Golf Course Project, and Empire Resorts Real Estate II, LLC ("ERREII" and together with ERREI, the "Montreign Subsidiaries" and, together with ERREI and Montreign Operating, the "Project Parties"), which is developing the Entertainment Village Project, each of which were formerly wholly-owned subsidiaries of Empire. The diagram below illustrates the Company's organization as to these entities before and after the restructuring:

Debt Financing for the Development Projects

 On January 24, 2017, Montreign Operating closed a senior secured first lien term loan facility, which provides an aggregate principal amount of $485 million of senior secured first lien term loans, consisting of $70 million of Term A loans and $415 million of Term B loans. In addition, on the same date, Montreign Operating entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility in the amount of $15 million. The net proceeds of the senior secured term facility will be used to fund costs relating to the construction of the Development Projects and the proceeds of the senior secured revolving credit facility will be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate expenses of Montreign Operating following the opening of the Casino Project to the public. The obligations of Montreign Operating under the aforementioned loan facilities are guaranteed by the Montreign Subsidiaries and are secured by security interests in substantially all of the assets of the Project Parties, as well as by a pledge of the membership interests in Montreign Operating by Montreign Holding. In connection with the senior secured term facility, Empire provided a guaranty capped at $30 million on the completion of construction of the Casino Project and the Entertainment Village Project.

The Golf Course Project and the Entertainment Village Project
ERREI and ERREII are responsible for the development and construction of the Golf Course Project and the Entertainment Village Project, respectively. The development of the Entertainment Village Project is expected to be built-out in phases. The Company is currently preparing the design plans for the Entertainment Village Project, which will consist of a non-gaming hotel with 100-200 guest rooms as well as dining, entertainment and retail offerings. The targeted rating for this hotel and its related amenities is in the range of 3-Star and 3-Diamond standards to serve mid-market customers. On December 8, 2016, the Company submitted to the Town of Thompson Planning Board (the "Planning Board") an application for the approval for the site plan for the hotel to be located within the Entertainment Village Project. The Planning Board held a special public hearing to consider the application on March 1, 2017.
ERREI has obtained final site approval from the Planning Board for, and has begun site preparation of, the redesign of the Golf Course Project. On December 28, 2016, the Planning Board extended this site plan approval for a period of six months to allow the Company to coordinate the commencement of construction and to obtain final approval of updates to the wetlands permits from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, if required.
Master Development Agreement and Completion Guaranties
On December 28, 2015 (the “MDA Effective Date”), the Project Parties, on the one hand, and EPT, EPR LP and Adelaar Developer, LLC (the “Destination Resort Developer,” together with EPT and EPR LP collectively, “EPR”), on the other hand, entered into an Amended and Restated Master Development Agreement (as amended, the “MDA”), which amends and restates that certain master development agreement by and between EPT and MRMI originally executed on December 14, 2012. The MDA defines and governs the overall relationship between EPR and the Project Parties with respect to the development, construction, operation, management and disposition of the Initial Projects.
4

In accordance with the terms of the MDA, the Project Parties shall each be responsible for the development and construction of their portion of the Development Projects. On December 28, 2015, Empire entered into a Completion Guaranty, guaranteeing completion of the development and construction obligations of the Project Parties described in this paragraph.
In accordance with the terms of the MDA, EPR is responsible for the development and construction of the Waterpark and the common infrastructure-related improvements (such as streets, sidewalks, sanitary and storm sewer lines, water, gas, electric, telephone and other utility lines, systems, conduits and other similar facilities) for the Destination Resort. EPR has agreed to be responsible for the development and construction of the Waterpark with a minimum capital investment of $120 million, and the infrastructure for the Destination Resort. EPR financed the costs of the infrastructure by the issuance of tax-exempt bonds by a local development corporation. The debt service for these infrastructure bonds will be funded through special district tax assessments, a portion of which will be allocated to each of the parcels on which the Initial Projects are being built. EPR and the Project Parties have agreed to a capped dollar amount on the special district tax assessment for each of the parcels on which the Development Projects are being built, above which the Project Parties will not be responsible. On December 28, 2015, EPR Properties, a real estate investment trust and the parent company of EPR, entered into a Completion Guaranty, guaranteeing completion of the development and construction obligations of EPR described in this paragraph.
Neither party has the right to terminate the MDA unless Montreign Operating fails to exercise the Purchase Option (as defined below) prior to its expiration in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Purchase Option Agreement (as defined below).
On January 24, 2017, the MDA was amended to (a) reflect that EPR has secured bond financing in connection with its infrastructure development obligations and (b) account for increases in the common infrastructure budget (and corresponding increases in Empire’s common infrastructure cap amount) in connection with the development of additional roads and increase in the budgeted amounts for New York State Electric and Gas costs. The changes to Empire’s common infrastructure cap amount were also reflected in each of the amendments to the Casino Lease, Golf Course Lease and Entertainment Village Lease.
Development Project Parcel Leases and Purchase Option Agreement
On December 28, 2015, the Project Parties entered into the Casino Lease, the Golf Course Lease, the Entertainment Village Lease and the Purchase Option Agreement (each as defined and described in "Properties - EPT Property" below). Option payments made by the Company pursuant to that certain option agreement, originally executed on December 21, 2011 and last amended on June 20, 2014 (the "Original Option Agreement"), which total $8.5 million, were applied against rent amounts due to EPT as rent under the Casino Lease, as more fully described below. The Original Option Agreement, which granted the Company the right to lease the Casino Parcel, was superseded by the Casino Lease, Golf Course Lease and the Entertainment Village Lease, which are described below in "Properties - EPT Property".
Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement

Term Loan Agreement
On January 24, 2017 (the "Loan Closing Date"), Montreign Operating entered into a Building Term Loan Agreement (the "Term Loan Agreement"), among Montreign Operating, the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch ("Credit Suisse"), as administrative agent. The Term Loan Agreement provides for loans to be made to Montreign Operating in an aggregate principal amount of $485 million (the "Term Loan Facility").
The Term Loan Facility consists of $70 million of Term A loans (the "Term A Loan") and $415 million of Term B loans (the "Term B Loan"). The Term B Loan was borrowed in full on the Loan Closing Date and the proceeds were used to pay fees and expenses related to the financing and fund various lender-controlled accounts. The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility (including proceeds of the Term A Loan, which will be deposited into the lender-controlled accounts upon borrowing) will be made available to Montreign Operating, subject to Montreign Operating satisfying the disbursement conditions set forth in the Term Loan Agreement and related loan documents, to pay debt service and costs relating to the development and construction of the Development Projects. 
The Term A Loan may be borrowed during the period from the Loan Closing Date to July 24, 2018, subject to meeting the conditions set forth in the Term Loan Agreement at the time of the borrowing. The Term A Loan will mature on January 24, 2022 and the Term B Loan will mature on January 24, 2023. Interest will accrue on outstanding borrowings under the Term A Loan at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 5.0% per annum, or an alternate base rate plus 4.0% per annum. Interest will accrue on 
5

outstanding borrowings under the Term B Loan at a rate equal to LIBOR (with a LIBOR floor of 1%) plus 8.25% per annum, or an alternate base rate plus 7.25% per annum. In addition, Montreign Operating will pay a commitment fee to each Term A Loan lender (“Term A Lender”) equal to the undrawn amount of such Term A Lender’s Term A Loan commitment multiplied by a rate equal to 2.5% per annum for the period commencing on the Loan Closing Date through March 24, 2018 and 5.0% per annum thereafter.
In the event that the Term B Loan is prepaid or repaid in whole or in part for any reason other than as a result of scheduled amortization and certain other exceptions, Montreign Operating is required to pay pre-payment premiums based on a make-whole if the prepayment occurs from the Loan Closing Date to (but excluding) the 30th-month anniversary following the Loan Closing Date (the “30th Month”), and a 2% and 1% premium if the prepayment occurs from the 30th Month to (but excluding) the 42nd-month anniversary of the Loan Closing Date (the “42nd Month”) and from the 42nd Month to (but excluding) the 54th-month anniversary of the Loan Closing Date, respectively.
Revolving Credit Agreement
On the Loan Closing Date, Montreign Operating also entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) among Montreign Operating, the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Fifth Third Bank, as administrative agent. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for loans or other extensions of credit to be made to Montreign Operating in an aggregate principal amount of up to $15 million (including a letter of credit sub-facility of $10 million) (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), the proceeds of which may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes following the opening of the Casino Project to the public. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on January 24, 2022. Interest will accrue on outstanding borrowings at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 5.0% per annum, or an alternate base rate plus 4.0% per annum.
Collateral and Other Provisions
The Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility are each guaranteed by the Montreign Subsidiaries and are secured by security interests in substantially all the real and personal property of Montreign Operating and the Montreign Subsidiaries and by a pledge of all the membership interests of Montreign Operating held by Montreign Holding. In addition, Empire delivered a completion guaranty in connection with the Term Loan Facility guaranteeing the completion of the construction of the Casino Project and the Entertainment Village Project. Empire’s liability under the completion guaranty (excluding lender’s enforcement costs) is capped at $30 million. 
The Term Loan Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement contain representations, warranties, affirmative covenants, negative covenants and financial covenants that are usual and customary, including representations, warranties and covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of Montreign Operating and the Montreign Subsidiaries to incur additional debt, incur or permit liens on assets, make investments and acquisitions, consolidate or merge with any other company, or make dividends or other distributions. Additionally, Montreign Operating is required to deposit $35 million into the lender-controlled account holding the net proceeds of the Term Loan Facility and the Kien Huat Montreign Loan, which amount will be used towards the Entertainment Village Project. Of this payment, $15 million is required to be deposited by June 30, 2017 and the remaining $20 million is required to be deposited by December 31, 2017. The $35 million must be funded in the form of a further equity contribution to Montreign Operating. The Company expects to raise additional equity capital to cover these amounts by the dates on which the deposits must be made. Obligations under the Term Loan Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon certain customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate), including, among others: nonpayment of principal, interest or fees; breach of the affirmative or negative covenants; revocation of a gaming license for seven consecutive business days; and a change of control (as such term is defined in the Term Loan Agreement) of Montreign Operating.

To further fund the Development Projects, on January 24, 2017, Montreign Operating entered into the Term Loan Agreement and Montreign Holding entered into the Kien Huat Montreign Loan Agreement. In connection with the consummation of the Term Loan Agreement, on the Loan Closing Date, that certain construction loan agreement (the "Kien Huat Construction Loan Agreement") dated October 13, 2016, by and between Kien Huat and Montreign Operating expired on its terms without being utilized by Montreign Operating. Montreign Operating and Kien Huat had entered into the Kien Huat Construction Loan Agreement to provide Montreign Operating with short-term access to up to $50 million of loans to pay the expenses of the Casino Project while the debt financing for the Development Projects was being finalized.

Kien Huat Montreign Loan Agreement
On the Loan Closing Date, Kien Huat and Montreign Holding entered into the Kien Huat Montreign Loan Agreement, pursuant to which Montreign Holding obtained from Kien Huat a loan in the principal amount of $32.3 million, the net proceeds of which will be used as a capital contribution to Montreign Operating for use towards the expenses of the Development Projects. The Kien Huat Montreign Loan shall mature on February 24, 2024 (the “Kien Huat Loan Maturity Date”), which Kien Huat Loan Maturity Date may be extended by Kien Huat in its sole discretion by up to an additional year.
The Kien Huat Montreign Loan bears interest at a rate of 12% per annum. Prior to the Kien Huat Loan Maturity Date,

Loan (the “Principal Indebtedness”) on the first business day of each calendar month beginning on February 1, 2017 (each an
“Interest Payment Date”) and shall thereafter be deemed to be part of the Principal Indebtedness. The Principal Indebtedness,
including all interest due through the applicable Interest Payment Date and other amounts due under the Kien Huat Montreign
Loan, shall be payable in cash on the Kien Huat Loan Maturity Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Montreign Holding shall
be required to pay in cash to Kien Huat, at the end of any “accrual period” (as defined in Section 1275(a)(5) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) ending after the fifth anniversary of the Loan Closing Date the aggregate
amount by which (x) the sum of (i) the amount of accrued interest on the Kien Huat Montreign Loan that has been added to the
Principal Indebtedness plus (ii) any other accrued but unpaid original issue discount (as determined under Section 163(i) of the
Code) on the Kien Huat Montreign Loan from the closing date through the end of such accrual period, in each case that has not
been paid in cash, exceeds (y) the product of (i) the “issue price” (as defined for purposes of the Code) and (ii) the “yield to
maturity” (as defined for purposes of the Code). In addition to the interest payable on the Kien Huat Montreign Loan, Kien
Huat was entitled to a commitment fee of 1%, which fee was added to the Principal Indebtedness of the Kien Huat Montreign Loan on the Loan Closing Date.
Until the Kien Huat Montreign Loan is repaid in full, Montreign Holding shall make no dividend or other distributions to Empire except (i) for purposes of paying bona fide corporate overhead expenses in an amount not to exceed $9 million (which amount is subject to further reduction pursuant to the Kien Huat Montreign Loan Agreement) and (ii) for purposes of the payment of taxes by Empire, to the extent also permitted by the Term Loan Agreement with respect to distributions from
Montreign Operating. The Kien Huat Montreign Loan may be prepaid in full or in part at any time without premium or penalty.
The obligations of Montreign Holding under the Kien Huat Montreign Loan Agreement are secured by a pledge of all the membership interests of Montreign Holding by Empire. The Kien Huat Montreign Loan Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative covenants that are usual and customary, including representations, warranties and covenants that, among other things, restrict Montreign Holding’s use of the proceeds of the Kien Huat Montreign Loan to expenses relating to the Development Projects. Obligations under the Kien Huat Montreign Loan Agreement may be accelerated upon certain customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate), including, among others: nonpayment of principal, interest or fees; breach of the affirmative covenants and a default with respect to the payment of principal or interest under the Term Loan Facility by Montreign Operating or acceleration of the Term Loan Facility for any reason.
County of Sullivan Industrial Development Agency Benefits Relating to the Development Projects
Casino Project IDA Benefits
In March 2013, the Company received approval from the County of Sullivan Industrial Development Agency ("IDA") for the provision of certain forms of financial assistance in connection with the development of the Casino Project. These
prospective benefits included, among others, (i) an exemption from New York State and local sales and use taxes with
respect to certain items used in, or for the acquisition, construction and equipping of the Casino Project (the “Casino Project
Tax Benefit”), which Casino Project Tax Benefit is subject to a cap, (ii) an exemption from all mortgage recording taxes
imposed in New York State, and (iii) a partial (or full) real property tax abatement over 16 years ((i), (ii) and (iii), collectively, the “Casino Project IDA Benefits”). The Casino Project IDA Documents, as further amended as discussed below, became effective upon the grant of the Gaming Facility License to Montreign Operating in December 2015.

In September 2014, the IDA and the Company entered into an Agent Agreement, Lease Agreement, Leaseback Agreement, payment in lieu of tax ("PILOT") Agreement, and related documents (together and as amended, the "Casino Project IDA Documents") providing for the Casino Project IDA Benefits following formal approval of such agreements by the IDA. Among other things, pursuant to the Casino Project IDA Documents, the Company is required to pay to the IDA (i) annual rent and (ii) a fee in connection with the use of these forms of financial assistance.

In support of site preparation activities for the Casino Project, on May 26, 2015, the IDA took action to allow the Company to obtain the Casino Project Tax Benefit with respect to its eligible Casino Project expenses immediately, even though the Casino Project IDA Documents would not be effective until the Gaming Facility License was issued. In connection with this authorization, the Company paid to the IDA an administrative fee of $150,000 and was permitted to defer an escrow payment in the amount of $100,000 until a building permit for the construction of the Casino Project is issued.
On August 14, 2015, the Company applied to the IDA to increase the cap on the Casino Project Tax Benefit and the value subject to the PILOT agreement as a result of changes to the design of the Casino Project, which substantially increased the cost of development. On September 18, 2015, the IDA approved amendments to the Casino Project IDA Documents (i) increasing the Casino Project Tax Benefit cap from approximately $15 million to $35 million and (ii) increasing the total value subject to the PILOT agreement from $53.5 million to $65 million. In connection with these amendments to the Casino Project IDA Documents, the annual rent due to the IDA from the Company on the Casino Project Parcel increased to $166,000 and the fee due to the IDA was increased by $82,500.
In connection with Montreign Operating's entry into the Term Loan Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement, on the Loan Closing Date, Montreign Operating, ERREI, the IDA and the Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as Collateral Agent, entered into a Building Loan Mortgage, Leasehold Mortgage, Assignment of Rents and Leases, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing. In connection with the execution of these agreements, the Company was exempt from the mortgage recording taxes imposed by New York State pursuant to the terms of the Casino Project IDA Documents.
Golf Course Project IDA Benefits
On June 20, 2016, ERREI obtained approval from the IDA for the provision of certain forms of financial assistance in
connection with the Golf Course Project, which prospective benefits include (i) an exemption from New York State and local sales and use taxes with respect to certain items used in, or for, the acquisition, construction and equipping of the Golf Course Project, (ii) an exemption from all mortgage recording taxes imposed in New York State, and (iii) a partial (or full) real property tax abatement over 16 years ((i), (ii) and (iii), collectively, the "Golf Course Project IDA Benefits"). 
On December 22, 2016, the IDA and ERREI entered into an Agent Agreement, Lease Agreement, Leaseback Agreement, PILOT Agreement and related documents (the "Golf Course Project IDA Documents") providing for the Golf Course Project IDA Benefits. ERREI is required to pay annual rent to the IDA in the amount of $10,000 per year for the first two years of the Lease Agreement term and $25,000 per year thereafter. In addition, ERREI is required to make annual PILOT payments to the IDA based on a total value of $4.8 million, which payment is discounted for the first two years of the property tax abatement period to accommodate for construction of the Golf Course Project.
Casino Project Branding
Montreign Operating is in discussions with an entity affiliated with Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay, a beneficiary of Kien Huat, to use certain trademarks related to the “Resorts World” and "Genting" names in relation to the Casino Project and the other Development Projects (the "RW License Agreement"). In addition, the parties are negotiating an agreement pursuant to which the Casino Project will become a member of the "Genting Rewards" customer loyalty program.

Monticello Casino and Raceway
Monticello Casino and Raceway began racing operations in 1958 and currently features the following:
• 1,070 VLTs and 40 ETGs (collectively 1,110 VGMs);
• year-round live harness horse racing;
• year-round simulcast pari-mutuel wagering on thoroughbred and harness horse racing from around the world;
• a 3,000-seat grandstand with retractable windows and a 100-seat clubhouse;
• parking spaces for 2,000 cars and 10 buses;
• an a la carte restaurant and a two-outlet food court with seating capacity for up to 100 patrons;
• a 1,386-square foot multi-functional space used for events;
• a 1,525-square foot simulcast room located directly adjacent to the gaming floor;
 • a casino bar and an additional clubhouse bar; and
• an entertainment lounge with seating for 75 patrons.

VGM Operations
We operate a 45,000-square foot VGM facility known as Monticello Casino and Raceway. The VGMs are owned by New York State and VGM activities in New York State are overseen by the NYSGC. Revenues derived from our VGM operations consist of VGM revenues and food and beverage revenues. 
Gross VGM revenues consist of the total amount wagered at our VGMs, less prizes awarded. The statute provides a
marketing allowance for racetracks operating video lottery programs of 10% on the first $100 million of net revenues generated
and 8% thereafter. Video lottery gaming is permitted for no more than 20 consecutive hours per day and on no day can such operation be conducted past 6:00 a.m.
Raceway Operations
Raceway operations, simulcasting and pari-mutuel wagering activities in New York State are overseen by the NYSGC. We derive our racing revenue principally from the following:
• wagering at Monticello Casino and Raceway on live races run at Monticello Casino and Raceway;
• fees from wagering at out-of-state locations and internationally on races run at Monticello Casino and Raceway
 using export simulcasting;
• revenue allocations, as prescribed by law, from betting activity at off-track betting facilities in New York State;
• wagering at Monticello Casino and Raceway on races broadcast from out-of-state racetracks using import
 simulcasting; and
• program and certain other ancillary activities.
Simulcasting
Import and, particularly, export simulcasting, are important parts of our business. Simulcasting is the process by which a live horse race held at one facility (the “host track”) is transmitted to another location that allows patrons of such other location to wager on that race. Amounts wagered at each off-track betting location are combined into the appropriate pools at the host 
9

track’s tote facility where the final odds and payouts are determined. With the exception of a few holidays, we offer year-round simulcast wagering from racetracks across the country. In addition, races of national interest, such as the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Breeders’ Cup supplement our regular simulcast programming. We also export live broadcasts of our own races to race tracks, casinos and off-track betting facilities in the United States and internationally.
On November 3, 2014, MRMI and the Monticello Harness Horsemen’s Association (the “MHHA”) entered into an
agreement that governs the conduct of MRMI and MHHA relating to horseracing purse payments, the simulcasting of horse
races and certain other payments (the “2014 MHHA Agreement”). The term of the 2014 MHHA Agreement expires seven years
from the date the NYSGC approves the Casino Project to engage in legalized gaming. On that same date, MHHA will also
receive, subject to adjustment for corporate events, 200,000 shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase 60,000 shares of common stock, the proceeds of any sales of which will provide additional monies for the harness horsemen’s purse account.
Pari-mutuel Wagering
Our racing revenue is derived from pari-mutuel wagering at our track and government mandated revenue allocations from certain New York State off-track betting locations. In pari-mutuel wagering, patrons bet against each other rather than against the operator of the facility or with pre-set odds. The amounts wagered form a pool of funds from which winnings are paid based on odds determined by the wagering activity. The racetrack acts as a stakeholder for the wagering patrons and deducts from the amounts wagered a “take-out” or gross commission from which the racetrack pays state and county taxes and racing purses. Our pari-mutuel commission rates are fixed as a percentage of the total handle or amounts wagered.
Regulation
The gaming industry is highly regulated and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. The Casino Project and Monticello Casino and Raceway are subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules, and regulations of New York State. These laws, rules, and regulations generally concern the conduct of operations as well as the responsibility, financial stability, and character of the facilities, owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Individuals and entities, including investors and vendors conducting business with us, must file license/registration applications with the NYSGC, and in some instances must submit to background investigations by the New York State Police in order to prove suitability for licensure/registration. Application, fingerprinting and investigative fees must be paid by us or by the individual or entity seeking licensure or registration. Failure to obtain and maintain a license or registration, as applicable, could require us to sever our relationship with such individuals and/or entities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations or the Development Projects. 
Our businesses are also subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, construction, land use, and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and federal anti-money laundering ("AML") laws, as further discussed below. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operations or the Development Projects. 
Casino Gaming Regulations
The Upstate New York Gaming and Economic Development Act ("Gaming Act"), provides among other things, the statutory framework for the regulation of full-scale casino gaming. The Gaming Act authorized the NYSGC to award up to four Gaming Facility Licenses. The NYSGC awarded Montreign Operating the sole Gaming Facility License in the Hudson Valley-Catskills region. It also awarded one Gaming Facility License in the Albany region and two Gaming Facility Licenses in the eastern Southern Tier/Finger Lakes region. The Gaming Act provides that no casinos shall be authorized in Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens or Richmond counties. New York State may, however, legislatively authorize additional Gaming Facility Licenses.
The Gaming Act provides for a seven-year exclusivity period for holders of Gaming Facility Licenses, commencing March 1, 2016, during which no further Gaming Facilities can be licensed by the NYSGC without legislative action. If the New York State legislature authorizes additional Gaming Facility Licenses within this exclusivity period, holders of the original four Gaming Facility Licenses shall have the right to recover a pro-rata portion of the license fee paid.

On March 1, 2016, the Minimum Capital Investment Deposit was made in the aggregate amount of $85.4 million. The Project Parties' portion of the Minimum Capital Investment Deposit was made in the form of a deposit bond representing approximately $65 million, which is 10% of the Company's share of the Minimum Capital Investment in the Development Projects and EPR's portion was made in the form of a deposit bond representing approximately $20 million, which is 10% of their Minimum Capital Investment in the infrastructure for the Destination Resort and the Waterpark. In addition, on March 30, 2016, we paid the license fee of $51 million, which is reflected on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as an intangible asset as of December 31, 2016. 
The operations of the Casino Project are subject to regulation by the NYSGC, Division of Gaming. The tax rate on slot machines at the Casino Project will be 39% and the tax rate on table games will be 10%. The tax rate on VGM operations at Monticello Casino and Raceway will remain at the existing NYSGC commission rate and is expected to include an additional commission from NYSGC, based on a rate related to the effective tax rate on all gross gaming revenue at the Gaming Facility developed by Montreign Operating. Existing payments to the racing industry for purses and breeding will be maintained. However, the Gaming Act requires the maintenance of the horsemen and breeder payments at the 2013 dollar level to be adjusted annually, pursuant to changes in the consumer price index. 
The Gaming Act imposes a $500 annual fee on each slot machine and table game. In addition, the Gaming Act requires that the minimum gambling age for the Casino Project will be 21, and no smoking will be authorized. 
Moreover, the Gaming Act deems the Casino Project to be a New York State agency for its capital projects for the purpose of MWBE participation and the NYSGC regulations require all contracts with Montreign Operating that are in excess of $25,000 to be reviewed by the NYSGC for the purpose of MWBE participation. Montreign Operating is expected to use good faith efforts to achieve a 30% MWBE participation rate with respect to the Casino Project.
Regulatory Permits and Approvals Relating to the Development Projects
 Casino Project

The Casino Project received all approvals and permits required to begin construction in February 2015 and began construction soon thereafter. In June 2015, Montreign Operating submitted certain changes in the design of the Casino Project, which received approval in July 2015. 
Entertainment Village Project and Golf Course Project
On July 22, 2015, the Planning Board granted preliminary site plan approval for the Golf Course Project. On April 13, 2016, the Planning Board approved the lot improvement/consolidation plan for the Golf Course Project, which enables the Company to submit an application for final site plan approval. The Company submitted such application for final site plan approval (the "Golf Course Final Site Plan Approval") for the Golf Course Project on May 25, 2016. On June 8, 2016, the Planning Board approved the Golf Course Final Site Plan Approval. On December 28, 2016, the Planning Board extended its approval of the Golf Course Final Site Plan Approval for a period of six months to allow the Company time to coordinate the start of construction.
On December 8, 2016, the Company submitted to the Planning Board an application for site plan approval for the Entertainment Village Hotel. On February 8, 2017, the Planning Board declared itself the lead agency under the New York State Environmental Quality Review Act and referred the site plan the the Sullivan County Department of Planning and set a public hearing date of March 1, 2017. The Planning Board held a special public hearing to consider the site plan on March 1, 2017. Continued review and final approval of the site plan application for the Entertainment Village hotel is anticipated in the coming weeks.

VGM and Racing Operations
Our VGM, harness horseracing and simulcast activities in New York State are overseen by the NYSGC, Division of Lottery and Division of Horse Racing and Pari-Mutuel Wagering, respectively. The NYSGC has the authority and
responsibility to promulgate rules and regulations that affect the operations of our business. By statute, from April 1, 2008 until March 31, 2017, 41% of gross VGM revenue is distributed to us. Unless the 2017-2018 New York State Budget, which we anticipate will be adopted before March 31, 2017, contains a provision to extend this share percentage of gross VGM revenue to March 31, 2018, effective as of April 1, 2017, only 39% of gross VGM revenue will be distributed to us. We anticipate that 
11

the New York State Budget will be adopted by March 31, 2017. In addition, the law provides for subsidized free play allowance of 15%.
Anti-Money Laundering Laws
        The operations of the Casino Project and Monticello Casino and Raceway are subject to federal AML laws. The AML laws relate to the reporting of large cash transactions and suspicious activity and include screening transactions against lists maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control in order to prevent the processing of transactions to or from certain countries, individuals, nationals and entities. Our AML policy was developed by applying a risk-based approach and is tailored to our business activities and customer risk profiles. The risk assessment will be updated and revised to reflect changes in our business to ensure sufficiency and effectiveness of our AML policy. Failure to comply with the AML laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties.
Market and Competition from Other Gaming and VGM Operations
The Development Projects are located in the Catskills region in New York State, which has historically been a resort area, although its popularity declined with the growth of other resort destinations. We are located approximately 90 miles northwest of New York City. Specifically, Monticello Casino and Raceway is directly adjacent to New York State Route 17 (the future Interstate 86), has highly visible signage and convenient access from Exit 104 of New York State Route 17. The Development Projects are located at the Destination Resort approximately three miles away from Monticello Casino and Raceway in the Town of Thompson. The Exit 106 interchange off of New York State Route 17 is being redesigned and reconstructed to connect directly to a newly constructed Destination Resort entry road that will deliver guests arriving from New York State Route 17 directly into the Destination Resort.
The casino entertainment business is highly competitive. The industry is comprised of a diverse group of competitors that vary considerably in size and geographic diversity, quality of facilities and amenities available, marketing and growth strategies, and financial condition. Generally, we will compete directly with certain VGM and casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding areas. Ultimately, the Casino Project and Monticello Casino and Raceway will also compete, in part, with each other. Upon the completion of the Casino Project and the remaining Initial Projects for the Destination Resort, we will also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, various other entertainment businesses, and other forms of gaming. Our non-gaming offerings will also compete with other retail facilities, amusement attractions, food and beverage offerings, and entertainment venues.
Gaming Operations

We expect the Casino Project to receive patronage from guests residing within 75 miles, which represents our primary market. With the completion of the Casino Project and the further opening of the Initial Projects, we expect to also receive patronage from guests residing within a 75- to 120-mile radius, which represents our secondary market. In addition, we are developing a marketing plan to attract Asian clientele both in the bus market from New York City and the mid to high-end gaming market. From game selection to food and beverage offerings, we have allocated appropriate space, game offerings and amenities to support these efforts.
We will face competition for the Casino Project from certain VGM facilities in New York State and from casinos in northeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey and, to a lesser extent, casinos and gaming facilities located on Native American lands in the Northeast. We will face competition for guests from our primary market from a VGM facility at Yonkers Raceway, located within the New York City metropolitan area. Yonkers Raceway has a harness horse racing facility, approximately 5,300 VGMs, food and beverage outlets and other amenities. In addition, we face competition in and from the northeastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut gaming markets in marketing to and attracting patrons from our secondary market, including the New York City metropolitan area. Pennsylvania casinos operate table games and slot machines, grant casino credit and have access to unlimited non-taxable free play. Pennsylvania legalized the operation of up to 61,000 slot machines at 14 locations throughout the state. As of March 3, 2017, there were 12 casinos in operation within Pennsylvania, with six located at racetracks. One such racetrack facility is Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, located approximately 70 miles southwest of Monticello, which has approximately 2,332 slot machines and 91 table games, including 18 poker tables, and a hotel and spa. In addition, Mount Airy Casino Resort in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, approximately 60 miles southwest of Monticello, has approximately 1,868 slot machines and 81 table games, including nine poker tables, a hotel, spa and a golf course and Sands Casino Resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, located approximately 95 miles from Monticello, has approximately 3,000 slot machines and 230 table games, including 30 poker tables, a hotel and spa. 
12

In addition to facing potential competition from the casinos in Atlantic City, legislators in New Jersey have reviewed options to place slot machines in various locations, including the Meadowlands Racetrack located in Bergen County, New Jersey. A referendum was placed on the ballot in November 2016 to enable voters to decide whether or not to amend the New Jersey State Constitution to permit two casinos in northern New Jersey, at least 72 miles from Atlantic City. The referendum was defeated by the voters. 
We also face potential competition from the current or future expansion of state-licensed gaming in New England and the northeastern United States and prospective gaming projects under consideration by Native American tribes, including federally-recognized tribes in Massachusetts and New York. With the addition of traditional table gaming in Rhode Island, Maine, Pennsylvania and Delaware in recent years, and new gaming facilities authorized or under development in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, commercial casino gaming has expanded in the northeastern United States and is poised to expand further. In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the single slot-only facility in Plainville has been open since 2015, while the two commercial casinos authorized for the cities of Springfield and Everett reportedly will open in 2018 and 2019, respectively. These jurisdictional expansions, many of which are convenience gaming facilities as opposed to destination gaming facilities, may not result in a corresponding increase in gaming revenues. 
Native American gaming projects being pursued by the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, which has entered into a tribal-state gaming compact, and the Aquinnah Wampanoag Tribe, both located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the Shinnecock Indian Nation of New York, also increase the possibility of new tribal gaming in the northeastern United States in the future. In addition, other federally-recognized Native American tribes continue to pursue new gaming projects elsewhere in the northeastern United States. Additionally, tribes seeking federal recognition, as well as presently federally-recognized Native American tribes, continue efforts to establish or expand reservation lands with an interest in commercial casino gaming on such lands. 
We are unable to predict the impact additional commercial casino and tribal gaming operations in the northeastern United States will have on our operations. We are also unable to predict whether changes in federal recognition rules or efforts by federally-recognized Native American tribes or tribes seeking federal recognition will lead to the establishment of additional Native American casino gaming operations in the northeastern United States, which could cause further competition with the Casino Project and the other Development Projects.
VGM Facilities

In New York State, we face competition for guests from Orange, Dutchess and Ulster counties for our VGM operation from a VGM facility at Yonkers Raceway. To a lesser extent, Monticello Casino and Raceway faces competition from two of the Pennsylvania casinos, Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs and Mount Airy Casino Resort. These facilities are discussed above.
Generally, Monticello Casino and Raceway does not compete directly with other harness racing tracks in New York State for live racing patrons. However, Monticello Casino and Raceway does face intense competition for off-track and other
legalized wagering at numerous gaming sites within New York State and the surrounding region. The inability to compete with larger purses for the races at Monticello Casino and Raceway and the limitation on other forms of legalized wagering that Monticello Casino and Raceway may offer has been a significant limitations on our ability to compete for off-track and other legalized wagering revenues.
Other Gaming
Currently electronic gaming machines are operated in 39 states, with 15 of the 39 states with commercial casinos that also offer table games. Legislation permitting other forms of casino gaming is proposed, from time to time, in various states,
including those bordering New York State. Our business could be adversely affected by such competition.
New York legislators have introduced bills related to Internet gaming and Internet poker. We are unable to determine whether and which, if any, legislation will be enacted and what effect it would have on our current operations. On August 3, 2016, New York Governor Cuomo signed legislation to legalize interactive fantasy sports. We do not believe that interactive fantasy sports will materially impact our results of operations.
Pennsylvania legislators have introduced bills related to Internet gaming and the conduct of lottery on the Internet. Such bills have been referred to committees. We are unable to determine whether and which, if any, legislation will be enacted and what impact it would have on our current operations.

New Jersey law permits Atlantic City casinos to conduct Internet gaming by accepting wagers from individuals who are physically present in New Jersey. Additionally, mobile gaming is permitted in any area located within the property boundaries of a casino hotel facility, including any recreation or swimming pool and excluding parking garages and parking areas. Further, New Jersey law permits racetrack customers to place bets on live or simulcast racing while they are on racetrack property, including the restaurants and outdoor areas, such as the paddock. New Jersey gaming regulations also authorized skill-based gaming options such as Candy Crush and Words with Friends-type games that appeal to a new generation of players. 
In December 2011, the United States Department of Justice (“Department”) confirmed the reversal of a long-standing precedent that applied a 1961 federal gambling law to Internet gambling. The Wire Act, 18 U.S.C § 1084, et. seq., prevents wagers from taking place over phone lines. Deputy Attorney General James Cole wrote in a letter to William J. Murray, then Deputy Director and General Counsel for New York Lottery, “The Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (‘OLC’) has analyzed the scope of the Wire Act, 18 U.S.C § 1084, and concluded that it is limited only to sports betting.” We are uncertain if the Department’s position would have any effect on our operations.
In November 2011, the voters in New Jersey approved a constitutional amendment permitting the legislature to authorize wagering at casinos in Atlantic City and at current or former racetracks, on the results of professional, certain college, and amateur sport and athletic events. There is legislation that would allow the state Casino Control Commission to issue licenses to casinos and racetracks to accept bets on some professional and collegiate events. However, in August 2016, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the prohibition of sports gambling in New Jersey, ruling that under federal law New Jersey may not permit racetracks and casinos to accept such sports wagers. We are uncertain if legalized sports wagering in New Jersey, if permitted in the future, would have an impact on our current or future operations.
