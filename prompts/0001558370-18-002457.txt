 General Development of Business
 Trans World Corporation (hereinafter referred to as “we,” “us,” the “Company,” or “TWC” or terms of similar import) was organized as a Nevada corporation in October 1993 for the acquisition, development and management of gambling establishments, to the extent permitted by applicable local laws, featuring live and mechanized gaming, including video gaming devices such as video poker machines, primarily in Louisiana.
 In 1998, we revised our operating strategy by shifting our focus to the casino market in Europe.  Furthermore, as a means of diversification of our business, we have also expanded our growth strategy to develop and/or acquire small-to-mid-size hotels of 80-250 rooms located in or near key metropolitan and/or resort areas in Europe, which may also include gambling operations.
 Today, we own and operate three full-service casinos and five hotels, all of which are four-star rated, as per the ratings from the Hotelstars Union, under the patronage of HOTREC, the umbrella association of hotels, restaurants and cafés in Europe, and covers hotel associations of Austria, the Czech Republic and Germany.  Our European operating units are organized under two reportable segments: a casino segment and a hotel segment.  Both segments are operated through our wholly-owned European subsidiaries.
 Our casinos are all in the Czech Republic (“CZ”) and are part of the casino segment, located in Ceska Kubice (“Ceska”), Hate (“Route 59”), and Dolni Dvoriste (“Route 55”). The Czech casinos, which conduct business under our registered brand name, American Chance Casinos (“ACC”), are situated at border locations and draw the majority of their customers from Germany and Austria.
 ACC’s operating strategy centers on differentiating its products and services from its direct competitors.  We operate our establishments with an emphasis on high customer service and attention to details.  We strive to create gambling environments with casual and exciting atmospheres, highlighting entertainment, state-of-the-art equipment, and professional service to our customers.
 Our hotels include the Hotel Savannah and Spa, a 79-room, four-star deluxe hotel, located in Hate, Czech Republic, and is part of our casino segment as it is physically attached to our Route 59 casino; Hotel Columbus, a 117-room, four-star property located in Seligenstadt, Germany; Hotel Auefeld, a 93-room four-star hotel located in Hannoversch Münden (“Hann. Münden”), Germany; Hotel Kranichhöhe, a 107-room four-star hotel located in Much, Germany; and Hotel Donauwelle, a 176-room, four-star property located in Linz, Austria. All three German hotels and the Austrian hotel comprise our hotel segment.
 Two of our units, Hotel Savannah and Spa and the Route 59 casino, operate as complementary businesses and are referred to jointly herein as the “Route 59 Complex.”  In addition to the gaming area, guest rooms, and the spa, which is 

 
  1

 

operated by an independent contractor, the Complex features eight banquet halls for meetings and special events as well as two full-service restaurants and two bars.
 On December 21, 2016, our wholly-owned German subsidiary, Trans World Hotels Germany GmbH (“TWHG”) acquired the Lindner Sport & Aktivhotel Kranichhöhe, a 107-room hotel with extensive meeting space and recreational amenities located in Much, Germany, for a purchase price of €4.9 million, or $5.3 million at the acquisition date.  The Company subsequently rebranded the hotel as Hotel Kranichhöhe.  The assets acquired by TWHG include: the hotel building and its contents; three food and beverage outlets; 18 meeting rooms; a wellness center and spa; a fitness center with an indoor swimming pool; an adjoining tennis complex with two indoor courts and two outdoor courts; and a beach volleyball court.  The hotel is located approximately two hours driving time from the Company’s Hotel Columbus in Seligenstadt, near Frankfurt, and approximately three hours driving time from its Hotel Auefeld in Hann. Münden.  We are investing approximately $1.9 million to update and partially renovate this hotel, including the refurbishment of a majority of the hotel’s guestrooms, installation of air conditioning in those rooms, refurbishment of the property’s conference space, and renovation of the hotel’s lobby. Approximately $1.1 million was spent in 2017, with the remainder to be disbursed in 2018.  The hotel was upgraded to a four-star rating on June 27, 2017. 
    
On March 1, 2017, TWC, through its wholly-owned Czech subsidiary, Trans World Hotels & Entertainment, a.s. (“TWH&E”) and TWHG jointly acquired 100% of the shares of Hotel Donauwelle Betriebsgesellschaft M.B.H, which owned a four-star business hotel located in Linz, Austria. The hotel is situated on the banks of the Danube River in Linz, approximately 35 minutes driving time from our Route 55 Casino. The assets acquired included the ground lease rights through March 2062 to the plot upon which the hotel building stands, and the building contents. The hotel features 176 rooms, six meeting/banquet rooms, a 120-seat restaurant, a 40-seat bar, a 100-seat outdoor terrace, and a spa and gym room. The hotel was under management contract with Steigenberger Hotels AG until September 30, 2017, when the contract was terminated. TWC assumed active management on October 1, 2017 and renamed the hotel as “Hotel Donauwelle” (herein referred to as “Hotel Donauwelle”).        TWC’s hotel operating strategy centers on offering both business and leisure travelers attractive facilities, professional service, comfortable accommodations, and a wide range of amenities, including food and beverage services, conference space, and recreational facilities.   The Company uses multiple channels to actively market its hotels to both business and leisure travelers.  Further, management strives to foster strong relationships with local businesses and communities, which primarily support the hotels’ food and beverage, conference and banquet, and recreation facilities.
 While our principal executive offices are located in New York City, we have no operating presence in the United States.  
 Corporate Information
 Our corporate offices are located at 545 Fifth Avenue, Suite 940, New York, New York 10017, our telephone number is (212) 983-3355, our website is www.transwc.com and the ACC website is www.acc.cz.  Neither website is a part of this Form 10-K. Description of Business
 TWC is engaged in the acquisition, development and management of niche casino operations in Europe, which feature gaming tables and mechanized gaming devices, such as video slot machines, as well as the acquisition, development and management of small-to-mid-size, four-star hotels, which may include casino facilities.  Our expansion into the hotel industry is founded on management’s belief that hotels in the small-to-mid-size class are complementary to our casino brand, that opportunities in one of these two industries often lead to, or are tied to, opportunities in the other industry, and that a more diversified portfolio of assets gives us greater stability and makes TWC more attractive to potential investors.  TWC’s top management executives include individuals with extensive experience in both the casino and hotel industries. Market Overview and Competition
 Historically, casinos in Germany and Austria have been characterized by formal atmospheres and a sense of exclusivity.  While this dynamic has changed across Europe over time, ACC was at the forefront of the movement 

 
  2

 

towards more relaxed casino atmospheres.  This, coupled with our emphasis on integrating live entertainment into the gambling experience and creating strong customer loyalty programs, allowed us to become a preferred alternative for many of our patrons.  Further, we have established ACC as a reputable casino company in the Czech Republic through our twenty plus years of operations that has featured high service standards, consistent professionalism and strict adherence to all local gaming regulations.
 As of December 31, 2017, five casinos operate in direct competition with our Ceska casino.  Our Route 59 and Route 55 casinos currently have two and three direct competitors, respectively.  Some of these competitors are larger and have financial and/or other resources that are greater than ours.
 While we do not consider our gambling business to be seasonal, it is occasionally impacted by extreme weather conditions (see also Item 1A “Risk Factors — Climate impact”) and major sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup (“World Cup”) and the UEFA Euro Cup (“Euro Cup,”), as well as regulatory changes, which have and can negatively impact attendance at our casinos.  
 We compete for guests based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, location, customer satisfaction, quality of service, amenities, quality of the gaming experience, quality of our accommodations, room rates, security and the ability of our customers to earn and redeem loyalty program points.  We believe that increased gambling in other locations in or near the market areas in which we operate, coupled with the increase in popularity of internet gambling, could create additional competition for us and could adversely affect our casino operations and development plans.  Further, the gambling industry in Eastern Europe faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending, including spectator sports and other entertainment and gambling options. Competitive gambling activities include traditional casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized and illegal gambling. We anticipate competition in this area will become more intense as the industry consolidates and new web-based ventures enter the industry.
 With respect to our hotel segment, in Germany, Hotel Columbus has six competitors in the Seligenstadt area and surrounding region that it serves, four of which are privately-owned and two of which are part of German hotel chains.   Hotel Auefeld is the largest hotel in Hann. Münden and no hotel chains are represented in that market.  However, Hotel Auefeld does compete with eight smaller, privately-owned, competitors in the Hann. Münden area. Hotel Kranichhöhe has one direct competitor in the city of Much and three competitors in the surrounding areas.  Hotel Donauwelle has six direct competitors in Linz.
 Owing to our quality product, adherence to high standards of hospitality and customer service, professionalism and strict compliance with all local hotel regulations and governances, we believe that we can compete effectively with these hoteliers.
 Costs and Effects of Environmental Compliance
 We incurred no material costs or effects due to environmental compliance for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
 Research and Development
 The Company does not engage in research and development other than internal market research for general business development, does not account for research expenditures separately under generally accepted accounting principles, and did not incur any separate research and development expense for 2017 or 2016.

 Our Facilities

 Ceska — The Ceska casino, which is located approximately one hour’s driving time from Regensburg, Germany, was acquired through a lease in March 1998 in conjunction with the Company’s entry into the casino market in Europe.  On November 23, 2011, TWC purchased the Ceska casino building, associated land and an adjacent outbuilding and related plot from the town of Ceska Kubice, from which TWC had been renting the facilities.  The acquisition allowed us to undertake much needed capital improvements to the building, as competition in the Ceska area has increased dramatically in recent years.  As of March 26, 2018, the two-story Ceska casino offered 13 gaming tables, including seven card tables and six roulette tables.  The casino also features 118 video slot machines and a dedicated stage area for live performances.  Amenities also include a separate dining facility and five luxurious hotel guest rooms. The address of our Ceska casino is Ceska Kubice 64, Ceska Kubice 345 32, Czech Republic.
 Route 59 — Located approximately one hour’s driving time from Vienna, Austria, and opened in December 1999, Route 59 was constructed by the Company on land that had been acquired by TWC in conjunction with our entry into the European casino market in 1998.  On February 22, 2016, we completed expansion and reconfiguration of the casino’s existing slot area and introduced 32 additional video slot machines.  As of March 26, 2018, our Route 59 casino operated 24 gaming tables, consisting of 12 card tables and 12 roulette tables, as well as 214 video slot machines.  Route 59 is located at 199 American Way, Hate-Chvalovice, Znojmo 669 02, Czech Republic.
 Route 55 — Located approximately 35 minutes driving time from Linz, Austria, and opened in December 2004, Route 55 was constructed by the Company on a parcel of land that had been purchased by TWC in April 2002.  As of March 26, 2018, the two-story Route 55 offered 22 tables, including 12 card tables and 10 roulette tables, as well as 192 video slot machines.  On the mezzanine level, the casino features an Italian restaurant, an open buffet area, and three luxurious hotel guest rooms.  Similar to the five guest rooms at Ceska, these rooms, when not used as accommodations for our VIP players and guests, are rented to other customers.  Route 55 is located at Grenzubergang Wullowitz, Dolni Dvoriste 382 72, Czech Republic.
 Hotel Savannah — As a complement to our Route 59 gaming operations, in January 2009, we opened Hotel Savannah, a 77-room, four-star deluxe hotel, attached to Route 59 by the hotel’s restaurant, on land that had been acquired by TWC in conjunction with our entry into the European casino market in 1998.  In conjunction with opening the hotel, we also launched a full-service spa, the Spa at Hotel Savannah, which is attached to the hotel and is sub-contracted to a local operator who pays TWC a percentage of its gross revenues.  The Spa features a large, 22 x 8 meter, indoor pool and Ayurvedic therapy facility.  Hotel Savannah also features eight banquet halls for meetings and events.  On March 26, 2017, we added two additional guest rooms to the hotel room inventory, which now totals 79 rooms.  The

creation of the Route 59 Complex has attracted additional business to the casino, contributing incremental cash, and enhancing the Company’s overall results.
 Hotel Columbus — We acquired Hotel Columbus, a four-star 117-room hotel, located in Seligenstadt, a town that is approximately 25 minutes equidistant from Frankfurt city center and the Frankfurt International Airport, in September 2014.  Hotel Columbus features five meeting rooms; a restaurant and separate breakfast room, each with its own kitchen; two bars; a 37-space parking garage; and 43 surface lot parking places, including a satellite parking area located across the street from the Hotel.  With the coming withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (“EU”), the city of Frankfurt is aggressively soliciting British financial institutions to relocate their European operations to the city.  Hotel Columbus is located at Am Reitpfad 4, 63500 Seligenstadt-Froschhausen, Germany.
 Hotel Auefeld — Hotel Auefeld, a 93-room, four-star hotel with extensive meeting space and recreational amenities located in Hann. Münden, Germany, was acquired in June 2015.  The hotel features three food and beverage outlets; ten meeting rooms; an adjoining 13,000 square foot event hall; an adjoining tennis complex with four indoor courts; and several additional recreation areas.  An independent townhouse comprised of one four-room and one six-room apartment was also included in the assets associated with the transaction.  Hotel Auefeld is located at Hallenbadstrasse 33, 34346 Hann. Münden, Germany.
 Hotel Kranichhöhe — Hotel Kranichhöhe is a 107-room, four-star hotel that includes extensive meeting space and recreational amenities and is located in Much, Germany.  The hotel features three food and beverage outlets; 18 meeting rooms; a wellness center and spa; a fitness center with an indoor swimming pool; an adjoining tennis complex with two indoor courts and two outdoor courts; and a “beach” volleyball court. The Company intends to invest approximately $1.9 million to update and partially renovate the hotel.  TWC spent approximately $1.1 million of this budget in 2017 toward the renovation, with the balance to be expensed in 2018.  Hotel Kranichhöhe, which was upgraded to a four-star rated hotel on June 27, 2017, is located at Boevingen 129, 53804 Much, Germany.
 Hotel Donauwelle — Hotel Donauwelle is a 176-room, four-star hotel, situated on the banks of the Danube River in Linz approximately 35 minutes driving time from our Route 55 Casino. The hotel includes six meeting/banquet rooms, a 120-seat restaurant, a 40-seat bar, a 100-seat outdoor terrace, and a spa and gym, as well as indoor and outdoor parking areas.  As a condition to our acquisition of the property, the lender required TWC to invest a minimum of €2.5 million (50% of which has been escrowed with the lender) to renovate the hotel within the first twelve months after acquisition, an action that we had previously determined to be necessary to make the property competitive in the marketplace.  Due to high business volume (i.e. high room occupancy), TWC asked for, and was granted, an extension to the end of August 2018 to complete its planned renovation of the property.  The first of a two-part room renovation was completed in August 2017, with 84 remaining rooms slated to be completed in July through August 2018.  Hotel Donauwelle is located at Am Winterhafen 13, 4020 Linz, in the State of Upper Austria, Austria.
     Our casinos each offer a restaurant, lounge areas, multiple bars and free parking.  Our Hotel Columbus, Hotel Auefeld and Hotel Donauwelle properties offer indoor and outdoor parking for a nominal fee, and our Hotel Kranichhöhe property offers outdoor parking for a nominal fee.  All of our hotels offer restaurant and lounge areas, bars, and meeting rooms. Our Hotel Savannah, Hotel Auefeld and Hotel Kranichhöhe also offer extensive recreational facilities.  With the exception of the long-term ground leases for the plots on which Hotel Auefeld and Hotel Donauwelle each stands, we own the land and buildings that comprise our casino and hotel assets.
 Intellectual Property
 In the highly competitive gaming and hospitality industries in which we operate, our trade names and logos are important to the success of our business. All of our casinos operate under the trademarked trade name “American Chance Casinos,” which we believe has become synonymous in our markets with our reputation for excellence in service, casual fun, international presence and state-of-the-art gaming equipment. In addition, the Hotel Savannah’s flowering tree logo has come to represent luxury and convenience for our overnight guests at our Route 59 Complex. The Company also maintains separate websites for our casinos and four hotels that provide users with updated information about news and events, and for the hotels, the ability to make room reservations online.

 Long Range Objectives
 With the acquisitions of Hotel Kranichhöhe and Hotel Donauwelle in 2016 and 2017, respectively, our current operations consist of three casinos and five hotels, with four units located in the Czech Republic, three units located in Germany, and one unit in Austria.  Our recent geographic and industry diversification is consistent with our long-range objective of positioning TWC as an international hotel and casino company.
 TWC, the senior management of which is composed of individuals who have extensive experience in both the hotel and casino industries, continues to explore ways to expand the Company’s operations through the acquisition and/or development of complementary gaming and hotel business units, while continuing to maximize the potential of the Company’s existing operations.  Future additions may include stand-alone operations, or complexes with integrated hotel and casino operations, such as our Route 59 Complex.
 Marketing and Sales
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, we maintained and enhanced our marketing and promotional programs for our casinos, focusing primarily on internal and customer-oriented loyalty reward programs and greater use of social media and digital communication methods.  In 2017, we strove to offer higher-value amenities and to provide, in the case of our casinos, live entertainment, in an ongoing effort to secure and enhance our competitive position in the markets that we serve.  The casinos’ event calendars concentrated on key, player-tested, popular events and holidays, while simultaneously focusing on higher player-incentive games designed to reward existing players with redeemable points via our Player’s Loyalty Program, and thereby promote customer loyalty.  In addition, we continued to be a benefactor in a number of community and social programs during the year as a way to further promote our image and make a positive contribution to the communities in which we operate.  We also continued our popular, cultural-themed and holiday-related parties, which feature live entertainment, raffles and complimentary grand buffets.  Further, we aggressively targeted key cities in our media campaigns, most notably Vienna, Linz and Regensburg and the areas surrounding these cities for our casinos and Hotel Savannah.  With respect to our three German hotels and one Austrian hotel, we focused our sales efforts on targeting corporate business and other market segments from the surrounding areas and neighboring countries, and worked to cultivate existing and new local and regional business relationships. Regulations and Licensing
 We are subject to numerous foreign international, national and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to the operation of a casino business, the operation of our hotel business, the preparation and sale of food and beverages, building and zoning requirements, data privacy and general business license and permit requirements, in the various jurisdictions in which we own and operate our properties.  Our ability to acquire and/or develop new casino and/or hotel properties and to remodel, refurbish or add to existing properties is also dependent on obtaining permits from local authorities.  We are also subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, hiring and firing, non-discrimination for disabilities and other individual characteristics, work permits and benefit offerings.  Compliance with these various laws and regulations can affect the revenues and profits of the properties we own and could adversely affect our operations.  We believe that our businesses are conducted in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
 On June 7, 2016, the President of the Czech Republic signed the 2017 Gambling Act (186/2016 Coll.) (the “Gambling Act”) and the 2017 Gambling Tax Act (187/2016 Coll.) (the “2017 Gambling Tax Act”) (collectively referred to as the “Gambling Acts”).  The Gambling Acts became law on June 15, 2016, when they were published in the official Collection of Laws, maintained by the Czech Ministry of the Interior.  The 2017 Gambling Tax Act became effective on January 1, 2017, and raised the gaming tax rate on technical game (i.e. slot machine or electromechanical roulette or dice) revenues to a “minimum tax,” and raised the tax rate from 28% to 35%, and eliminated the per diem fixed fee of Kč 80 (approximately $3.76) on each slot machine.  
     The 2017 Gambling Act introduced many new changes, requirements and conditions, that will become effective at various times, some taking effect on the date of enactment, some on January 1, 2017 and certain provisions taking effect upon the renewal of the casino operator’s gambling licenses.  TWC’s 10-year federal gambling license was scheduled to expire at the end of 2018, and its one-year slot operating license expired at the end of 2017, the timing of 

 
  6

 

which required the Company to reapply for both gambling licenses under the new legislation.  Therefore, TWC took all the proper measures to conform to the underlying requirements for each basic gambling license, one to cover live games and the other to cover technical games (e.g. slots).  On November 15, 2017 and December 28, 2017, TWC received from the Ministry of Finance (“MOF”) its gambling licenses for live games and technical games, respectively.  Further, on December 29, 2017, TWC was granted premises licenses in the three municipalities in which it operates.  The Company is also awaiting the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic’s final interpretation of certain new measures, some of which were clarified in August 2016.  The Company is also awaiting clarification from the MOF whether a recertification of its casino management system (“CMS”) is required following any upgrades to the CMS.  The notable changes and requirements of the 2017 Gambling Act are as follows:
    
· | Upon the effective date of the Gambling Act, any gambling operator may apply for a gambling license if it meets all of the following conditions, having: (i) an office in the Czech Republic, in another EU Member state or in a state that is a party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area; (ii) an organizational chart that sets clear and comprehensive definitions of jurisdictions and decision-making powers; (iii) an established board of directors or similar control body; (iv) equity of at least of €2,000,000 (approximately $2.4 million); (v) a transparent and unobjectionable origin of its financial resources; and (vi) a transparent ownership structure. During the licensing process, confirmation of corporate ownership of the Czech entity and required documents (e.g. criminal and tax records, etc.) from all members of the board of directors and representatives from all levels of the company structure must be furnished to the MOF. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A basic, general gambling license from the MOF will be issued for a maximum of six (6) years and a gambling license (i.e. premises license) for each location at which live game and technical game operations are conducted will be issued from local municipality councils for a maximum of three (3) years. Previously, the MOF general gambling licenses for live games had been issued for ten (10) years and for one (1) year for technical games. Licenses can be issued and/or renewed if the Company meets the following pre-existing conditions: (i) the Company and its representatives maintain a clean criminal record and all necessary certifications; (ii) the Company and its representatives pay their taxes and other necessary charges on time; (iii) the Company stays in good standing; (iv) the Company confirms its ability to comply with all technical and supervisory standards required by the new law; and (v) the Company does not disturb public order. As of December 31, 2017 and the date hereof, TWC was, and is in, compliance with these conditions and thereby has received all required licenses to operate. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Individual municipalities and their local councils will be entitled to issue decrees to prohibit or restrict gambling operations, to set permissible hours of gambling operations and designate locations of operations within their respective jurisdictions. Previously, municipalities, by decree, were allowed to ban gambling operations or set the locations of gambling operations within their respective jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2017 and the date hereof, TWC was, and is, in good standing with all of the municipalities in which it operates. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Gambling operations will not be permitted in proximity to certain premises, such as schools, children’s leisure facilities, health and social care facilities, churches or religious societies. As of December 31, 2017 and the date hereof, TWC’s existing casinos were, and are, in compliance with this requirement. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Gambling operators will be required to follow certain self-restricting measures put in place by individual players. For instance, an operator must create an individual account for each player, which the player can use to manage his/her gaming expenditures and frequency of play, including a maximum number of casino visits per month. These accounts must also allow players to set individual limits on gambling activities, including setting maximum bets per day or per calendar month or a maximum amount of net loss per day or per calendar month. Each customer’s identity must be checked against the MOF’s central database of individuals excluded from participation in gambling activities (i.e. blacklisted). For foreign citizens living in the Czech Republic (expats), the individual account would be valid for only 90 days, following which a reapplication would be required to setup the account. Some of these provisions will not become effective until one year after the MOF has published a complete technical specification of its central database (gambling operation information system), but the self-restriction provisions for technical games became effective immediately after new gambling licenses were obtained. In order to meet these self-restricting measures, the Company implemented a casino management system in all of its three casinos in August 2017. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Gambling operators will also be required to ban from entry individuals flagged by the MOF and registered in its central database as blacklisted or noted as being “destitute” and on public assistance, bankrupt, subject to an
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

order banning them from gambling under Czech criminal law, or compulsive gamblers. As noted above, this provision will not become effective until one year after the MOF has published a complete technical specification of its central database (gambling operation information system). No one under age 18 will be allowed on the casino floor. As of December 31, 2017 and the date hereof, TWC was, and is, in compliance with this age requirement. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Gambling operators will not be able to provide for free, or at reduced prices, any benefits to players, including food, beverages, tobacco products or “stimulating substances.” TWC has been in full compliance with this requirement since January 1, 2018, when its new gambling licenses became effective. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Gambling operators will be required to post a sign on each technical game warning that gambling is “harmful”, advising of the amount of the player’s net losses and how long the player has been playing, with a requirement that there be a 15-minute break after every two hours of continuous play. In the event a player takes the obligatory break earlier than the elapse of two hours of continuous play AND the break is at least 15 minutes, then a new two-hour play period would start. However, if the break is shorter than 15 minutes, then the break will not qualify as the obligatory 15-minute break, and would not constitute a restart of the two-hour play period. TWC is in full compliance with this requirement. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | All customer transactions, such as exchanging money for gambling chips, must be logged and those records must be kept for 10 years, up from five years under the previous law. TWC extended its record archiving to 10 years to comply with this requirement. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The required retention period of all required real time color audio/visual surveillance recordings will increase from three months to 24 months. The Company has installed new surveillance systems in all its casinos that meet this requirement. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maximum bets for technical games will be increased to Kč 1,000 (about $45) from the current amount of Kč 675 (about $32) and maximum win (or jackpot) per slot machine will be decreased to Kč 500,000 (approximately $23,500) from the current amount of Kč 675,000 (approximately $31,700). Slot and electromechanical machine vendors/suppliers will be required to incorporate these limit changes into all slots and technical games that they sell/service to the casinos. Further, a law on limitation of cash payments imposes a maximum daily transaction limit of Kč 270,000 (or approximately $12,700) on cash transactions. Any slot jackpot payouts exceeding this limit on any given day can only be paid either directly to the player’s bank account or in two per diem payments where the player can pick up the remainder amount on the following day. TWC was and is in full compliance with this requirement since January 1, 2018, when its new gambling licenses became effective.

· | Casinos must have a minimum of three live games tables and 30 technical games available during operating hours. For each additional live game table, a casino may operate an additional 10 slot or technical game machines. If a casino has more than 10 live game tables, there is no limit on the number of slot or technical game machines permitted. All of TWC’s existing casinos each have more than 10 live game tables in operation and are, thereby, already in compliance with this requirement.

· | A gaming bond equal to Kč 10 million (approximately $470,000) will be required to be paid by a casino operator to the MOF for each of its casino units. For operators owning multiple casinos, a minimum bond of Kč 20 million (approximately $940,000) is required, up to a maximum of Kč 50 million ($2.3 million) for any licensee, regardless of the number of casinos owned and operated beyond five casino units. Previously, only one gaming bond of Kč 22 million ($1.0 million) was required, which was used for all of the existing licenses. As a condition to acquiring new gaming licenses, the Company provided a new gaming bond of Kč 30 million ($1.4 million) to meet the new bond requirements for its three casinos, resulting in a net increase of Kč 8 million (approximately $381,000) from its existing bond. Therefore, the casino operator must initially pledge additional funds to secure the new bond requirement, which, for TWC, will amount to Kč 30 million ($1.4 million). TWC posted the additional bond payment in December 2017. On March 7, 2018, the old gaming bond was cancelled by the MOF and the funds were released free and clear to the Company.

     We have been, and are currently, in compliance with all such conditions that are currently in effect. See also “Taxation,” below.
     There can be no assurance that such licenses, approvals or findings of suitability will be obtained in the future or will not be revoked, suspended or conditioned, or that we will be able to obtain the necessary governmental approvals for our future activities.
 Iran Sanctions Disclosure
 Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, if during 2017, TWC or any of its affiliates have engaged in certain transactions with Iran or with persons or entities designated under certain executive orders, we would be required to disclose information regarding such transactions in our Annual Report as required under Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, or ITRA.  Certain of the Iran sanctions were lifted on January 16, 2016.  During 2017, the Company did not engage in any of the law’s enumerated transactions with Iran or with persons or entities related to Iran.   Taxation
 Gaming Taxes
 As noted above, we are subject to legislative changes that, at times, result in material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.  
 On June 7, 2016, the President of the Czech Republic signed the Gambling Acts.  The 2017 Gambling Tax Act became effective on January 1, 2017.  The new law raised the gaming tax rate on technical game (i.e. slot machine or electromechanical roulette or dice) revenues to the greater of a “minimum tax,” or 35%, and eliminated the per diem fixed fee of Kč 80 ($3.76) on each slot machine.  
 This new “minimum tax” on technical games is equal to the product of: (x) the sum of all gambling positions of individual approved terminal devices (such as slot machines, electromechanical roulette and dice machines) permitted for the location of the gambling premises, times (y) Kč 9,200 (approximately $432).  Therefore, if the aggregate tax amount collected from the 35% gaming tax on technical game revenues is lower than the computed “minimum tax,” then the casino operator must pay the “minimum tax” and not the aggregate tax amount collected from the 35% gaming tax.  Otherwise, if the aggregate tax amount collected from the 35% gaming tax on technical game revenues is greater than the computed “minimum tax,” then the casino operator need only pay the aggregate tax amount collected from the 35% gaming tax and not the “minimum tax.”  The gaming tax rate on live game (i.e. cards, roulette or dice) revenues remains

unchanged at 23%.  Further, the 2017 Gambling Tax Act modified the tax revenue allocation between the federal government and local municipalities.  A summary table of the 2017 Gambling Tax Act is shown below: 

 | 2017 Gambling Tax Act 
(in actual amounts) | (Effective from January 1, 2017) 
Live Games | 23% gaming tax from revenue earned from live games (70% of tax allocated to the federal government; 30% of tax allocated to the local municipality). 
Slot and other technical games | The greater of either: (a) the aggregate amount collected from 35% gaming tax from revenue earned from slot and other technical games (35% of tax allocated to the federal government; 65% of tax allocated to the local municipality), or (b) a "minimum tax," calculated as the product of the sum of all gambling positions of individual approved terminal devices referred to in the permit for the location of the gambling premises times Kč 9,200 (approximately $432).
Net Income | No change from the 19% corporate income tax noted below. 

      On December 15, 2015, the President of the Czech Republic signed an amendment to the Gaming Law that increased gaming tax rates payable by all gaming operators, including TWC, effective January 1, 2016 (the “2016 Gaming Tax Amendment”).  (See TWC’s Form 8-K, dated December 21, 2015).  As a result of this amendment, gaming taxes on live game revenues increased from 20% to 23% and gaming taxes on slot revenues increased from 20% to 28%.  In addition, the amendment increased the fee per slot machine per day to Kč 80 ($3.76) from Kč 55 ($2.58). The amendment became law on December 28, 2015, when it was published as Act No. 380/2015 Coll. in the official Collection of Laws, maintained by the Czech Ministry of the Interior.

Live Games | 23% gaming tax from revenue earned from live games (70% of tax allocated to the federal government; 30% of tax allocated to the local municipality). 
Slots | 28% gaming tax from revenue earned from slot games (20% of tax allocated to the federal government; 80% of tax allocated to the local municipality); and a per diem fixed fee of Kč 80 ($3.76) per slot machine (allocated to the federal government).
Net Income | No change from the 19% corporate income tax noted below. 

  TWC’s gaming-related taxes and fees for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized in the following table:

 | For the Year Ended | 
(amounts in thousands) | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Gaming revenues (excl. ancillary revenues) | $ | 37,462 | | $ | 44,967 | 
Gaming taxes | $ | 11,754 | | $ | 12,398 | 
Gaming taxes as % of gaming revenues (above) | | 31.4 | % | | 27.6 | %

  Gaming taxes are payable by the 25th day following the end of each calendar quarter, while corporate income tax is paid by June 30th of the subsequent year.  Estimated quarterly income tax payments are also required since the third quarter of 2013.  TWC was current on all of its Czech tax payments at December 31, 2017 and through the date of this report.
 Corporate Income Taxes
 Effective January 1, 2012, in conjunction with other changes to gaming tax rates, the Czech government instituted an effective corporate income tax, currently 19.0%, on all income, including gaming income. Prior to the law change, our Czech casino operations were subject only to gaming taxes.  The income tax rate in Germany is approximately 30.0%.  We have no gambling operations in Germany as of the date of the Annual Report.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred a total net income tax expense of approximately $1.1 million, inclusive of a deferred income tax liability of $367,000.  The prior year income tax expense of approximately $2.7 million included a deferred income tax benefit of $130,000.   We did not incur any corporate income taxes in Germany from our hotel operations for the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2016, due to the consolidated losses arising from acquisition-related closing costs incurred in these two years.

On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”), was enacted in the United States. The TCJA made many significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to businesses and their owners, including stockholders of publicly traded corporations. Pursuant to this legislation, as of January 1, 2018, among other things, (i) the federal income tax rate applicable to corporations is reduced to 21%; (ii) the highest marginal individual income tax rate is reduced to 37% (through taxable years ending in 2025); (iii) the corporate alternative minimum tax is repealed; (iv) the backup withholding rate for U.S. stockholders is reduced to 24% and; (v) there is a migration from a “worldwide” system of taxation to a territorial system.  The deduction of net interest expense is limited for all businesses; provided that certain businesses may elect not to be subject to such limitations and instead to depreciate their real property related assets over longer depreciable lives. The reduced 21% federal income tax rate applicable to corporations will apply to taxable earnings reported for the full 2018 fiscal year. As a result of this legislation, the Company remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. The Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the TCJA and refining 

 
  11

 

its calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts.  The provisional amount recorded related to the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax balances was $2,810 which was offset fully by the provisional amount recorded related to the reversal of previously established valuation allowances against these deferred tax balances. In addition, the Company recognized $5,203 of tax expense related the deemed repatriation of foreign accumulated earnings.
    
We are still in the process of evaluating the income tax effect and other changes required by the TCJA that will be effective for our fiscal year 2018. Because we do not generate earnings in the United States, we have not paid U.S. corporate income taxes in 2017 or 2016. 
 Value Added Taxes
 In conformity with the EU taxation legislation, the Czech Republic’s value added tax (“VAT”) has gradually increased from 5%, when that country joined the EU in 2004, to 21%, the effective rate since 2013.  Unlike in other industries, VATs are not recoverable for gaming operations.  The recoverable VAT under the hotel segment was not material for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 629 full and part-time employees, of which 83 work in Ceska; 168 in Route 59; 125 in Route 55; 45 in Hotel Savannah; 32 in Hotel Columbus; 48 in Hotel Auefeld; 56 in Hotel Kranichhöhe; 43 in Hotel Donauwelle; 24 in our shared services offices, located in our Ceska Casino; and five in the Company’s headquarters in New York City, New York.  None of our employees are represented by a union nor are we a party to any labor contract.
