 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”, “we” or “us”) is a large and fast growing provider of bandwidth infrastructure in the United States, Canada and Europe. Our products and services enable mission-critical, high-bandwidth applications, such as cloud-based computing, video, mobile, social media, machine-to-machine connectivity, and other bandwidth-intensive applications. Key products include leased dark fiber, fiber to cellular towers and small cell sites, dedicated wavelength connections, Ethernet, IP connectivity, cloud services and other high-bandwidth offerings. We provide our services over a unique set of dense metro, regional, and long-haul fiber networks and through our interconnect-oriented data center facilities. Our fiber networks and data center facilities are critical components of the overall physical network architecture of the Internet and private networks. Our customer base includes some of the largest and most sophisticated consumers of bandwidth infrastructure services, such as wireless service providers; telecommunications service providers; financial services companies; social networking, media, and web content companies; education, research, and healthcare institutions; and governmental agencies. We typically provide our bandwidth infrastructure services for a fixed monthly recurring fee under contracts that vary between one and twenty years in length.  We operate our business with a unique focus on capital allocation and financial performance with the ultimate goal of maximizing equity value for our stockholders. Our core values center on partnership, alignment, and transparency with our three primary constituent groups - employees, customers, and stockholders.
 We were founded in 2007 with the investment thesis of building a bandwidth infrastructure platform to take advantage of the favorable Internet, data, and wireless growth trends driving the on-going demand for bandwidth infrastructure, and to be an active participant in the consolidation of the industry. The growth of cloud-based computing, video, mobile and social media applications, machine-to-machine connectivity, and other bandwidth-intensive applications continues to drive rapidly increasing consumption of bandwidth on a global basis. As an early believer in the enduring nature of these trends, we assembled our asset base and built a business model specifically to provide high-bandwidth connectivity to customers whose businesses depend most on the continuous and growing demand for bandwidth. As a core tenet of our strategy for capitalizing on these industry trends, we have been a leading industry consolidator and have acquired 41 bandwidth infrastructure businesses and assets to date. Our owned, secure, and redundant fiber network and data centers serve as the foundation for our bandwidth solutions and allow us to offer customers dark fiber solutions, network connectivity and colocation and cloud infrastructure services. We believe the continuously growing demand for stable and secure bandwidth from service providers, enterprises and consumers, combined with our unique and dense metro, regional, and long-haul networks, position us as a mission-critical infrastructure supplier to the largest users of bandwidth.
 Our network footprint includes both large and small metro geographies, the extended suburban regions of many cities, and the large rural, national and international links that connect our metro networks. We believe that our network assets would be difficult to replicate given the geographic reach, network density, and capital investment required. As of June 30, 2017, our fiber networks span over 123,841 route miles and 10,438,246 fiber miles (representing an average of 84 fibers per route), serve 391 geographic markets in the United States, Canada and Europe, and connect to approximately 31,000 buildings, including approximately 7,500 cellular towers and 1,141 data centers. We own fiber networks in large metro areas, such as New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Paris, and London, as well as smaller metro areas, such as Allentown, Pennsylvania, Fargo, North Dakota, and Spokane, Washington. Our networks allow us to provide our high-bandwidth infrastructure services to our customers over redundant fiber facilities between key customer locations.  We believe our ownership and the location and density of our expansive network footprint allow us to more competitively service our target customers’ bandwidth infrastructure needs at the local, regional, national, and international level relative to other regional bandwidth infrastructure service providers or long-haul carriers. We also provide our network-neutral colocation and interconnection services utilizing our own data centers located within major carrier hotels and other strategic buildings in 49 locations throughout the United States, Canada and Europe and operate approximately 870,000 square feet of billable colocation space.

 The density and geographic reach of our network footprint allow us to provide tailored bandwidth infrastructure solutions on our own network (“on-net”) that address the current and future bandwidth needs of our customers. Our dense metro and regional networks have high fiber counts that enable us to provide our dark fiber solutions, network connectivity and colocation and cloud infrastructure services. Our networks are deep and scalable, meaning we have spare fiber, conduit access rights and/or rights of way rights that allow us to continue to add capacity to our network as our existing and new customers’ demand for our services increases. In addition, many of our core network technologies provide capacity through which we can continue to add wavelengths to our network without consuming additional fiber. We also believe the density and diversity of our networks provide a strong and growing competitive barrier to protect our existing revenue base. We believe our networks provide significant opportunity to organically connect to new customer locations, data centers, towers, or small cell locations to help us achieve an attractive return on our capital deployed. Since our founding, we have assembled a large portfolio of fiber networks and colocation assets through both acquisitions and customer demand-driven investments in property and equipment. From our inception to date, we have completed acquisitions with an aggregate purchase consideration, net of cash acquired, totaling approximately $6.5 billion. For the period from July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2017, we also invested approximately $2.1 billion in capital expenditures, exclusive of acquisitions and stimulus grant reimbursements, primarily to expand the reach and capacity of our networks. As of June 30, 2017, our total debt (including capital lease obligations and before any unamortized discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs) was $5,710.3 million and was primarily incurred in connection with acquisitions.
 Our business model focuses on providing on-net bandwidth infrastructure solutions to our customers, which results in what we refer to as “infrastructure economics.” Infrastructure economics are characterized by attractive revenue visibility and strong margins coupled with operating leverage for new revenue, success-based capital investments with low maintenance capital needs, and the ability to generate significant cash flow over time. For the year ended June 30, 2017, approximately 89% of our revenue was recurring in nature. Our capital expenditure investments are primarily success-based, meaning that before we commit resources to expand our network, we have a signed customer contract that will provide us with an attractive return on the required capital investment. After committing capital to connect additional customer sites, our goal is to sell additional high-bandwidth connectivity on these new routes at a relatively low incremental cost, which further enhances the return we extract from our asset base. Finally, the combination of our scale and infrastructure economics results in the ability to generate meaningful free cash flow over time.
 Our management is intensely focused on creating equity value for our stockholders. Our equity value creation philosophy includes regular and rigorous financial and operational measurement, financial transparency (both internally and externally), and clear alignment of interests among employees, management, and stockholders. Our real-time measurement and reporting system serves as the foundation for our decision making and our extensive financial and operational disclosure. We also believe in fostering an entrepreneurial culture that aligns the interests of our employees, management, and stockholders.
 We are a Delaware corporation formed in 2007.  As of June 30, 2017, we had 3,794 employees.
 Our fiscal year ends June 30 each year and we refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as “Fiscal 2017”, the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as “Fiscal 2016”, and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 as “Fiscal 2015”.
 Bandwidth Infrastructure Industry
 We are a bandwidth infrastructure provider, and our services are a critical component of the broader global communications industry. Bandwidth infrastructure, consisting primarily of fiber networks and interconnect-oriented colocation facilities, plays a fundamental role in the communications value chain, similar to other types of infrastructure such as data centers and cellular towers. Bandwidth infrastructure assets are a critical resource, connecting data centers, cellular towers, and other carrier and private networks to support the substantial growth in global data, voice and video consumption by both business and individual consumers. Industry History
 Our industry has changed substantially over the years. The first phase of the bandwidth infrastructure industry occurred with the advent of the Internet and the ensuing dot com era in the late 1990s. This led to the first major wave of fiber network deployments as a number of companies of varying backgrounds invested billions of dollars in fiber network construction throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe. These fiber network developers included companies with 

 
  2

 
national and international plans (e.g., Level 3 Communications, Qwest Communications, Williams Communications) and more regional plans (e.g., 360networks, Progress Telecom, OnFiber). Following these network builds, many of the fiber companies struggled in the early 2000s due to the lack of sufficient demand for their high-bandwidth services. Bandwidth demand during this timeframe was limited by the fact that many bandwidth-intensive applications (e.g. streaming video, cloud, mobile broadband, big data analytics, etc.) were either not yet contemplated or still very early in their life cycle. Instead, the majority of traffic at the time was low-bandwidth services such as voice and dial-up modem connections. In addition, the similarity of the fiber routes deployed resulted in significant overcapacity and associated pricing pressure, leaving a “last mile” gap and heavy competition and overcapacity along these routes. These two primary factors combined to significantly limit the fiber network providers’ operating cash flows, resulting in the majority of these companies transitioning their business models, consolidating and/or seeking bankruptcy protection.
 In the following years, a substantial expansion in computing power and bandwidth-intensive applications drove meaningful bandwidth traffic growth. This growth highlighted the need to address the “last mile” gap by bringing bandwidth capacity directly to both the consumer and business end user. The capacity and performance of the consumer last mile connection was primarily addressed by the expansion of cable networks and through mobile network development by wireless carriers (supported by cellular tower operators). The growing bandwidth demand of business end users was addressed by a number of focused fiber developers constructing new networks to directly connect to data centers, cellular towers, government facilities, schools, hospitals and other locations with high-bandwidth needs. These fiber network companies were generally local or regional in nature, and were most often either survivors of the initial fiber development wave, subsidiaries of a utility parent, or owned by entrepreneurs. This period is also noted for increased financial discipline following the large speculative capital deployments of the dot com era. This is the timeframe and industry environment in which our Company was founded.
 The Industry Today
 The acceleration in the development of bandwidth-intensive devices and applications has resulted in a significant need to further fill in the “last mile” gap, leading to substantial capital investments in fiber networks by bandwidth infrastructure providers. Bandwidth infrastructure service providers support applications such as high definition television broadcasting and video; online streaming video; cloud applications replacing in-house enterprise software platforms; and explosive mobile data consumption (Cisco found that, in 2016, global mobile data traffic was equivalent to 18x the volume of global mobile traffic five years earlier in 2011). Companies whose services require large amounts of bandwidth and enterprises that consume large amounts of bandwidth are struggling to adapt to this rapidly evolving landscape, and the bandwidth infrastructure industry is growing in economic importance as it addresses this critical need. In addition to these demand trends, there has been significant consolidation amongst the bandwidth infrastructure services providers, validating a core tenet of the Company’s founding investment thesis. Since inception we have made 41 acquisitions in the US, Europe and Canada with an aggregate purchase consideration, net of cash acquired, totaling approximately $6.5 billion. Industry Participants
 We view the participants in today’s communications industry in two distinct categories:

· | Providers of Infrastructure. Companies that own and operate infrastructure assets that are used to market and deliver infrastructure services. We believe these assets would be difficult to replicate given the significant capital, time, permitting, and expertise required. Providers of infrastructure typically enjoy long-term customer contracts, a highly visible and recurring revenue base, and attractive margins. We further categorize these providers of infrastructure as follows: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Bandwidth Infrastructure Providers: Owners of bandwidth infrastructure assets comprised of fiber networks and interconnect-oriented colocation facilities. Bandwidth infrastructure services include dark fiber, lit services (wavelengths, Ethernet, IP, and SONET), and colocation and interconnection services for the purpose of transporting mission-critical traffic including data, voice, and video. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Data Center Providers: Owners of data center facilities that include raised floor, power and cooling infrastructure. These facilities house and support networking and computing equipment for carrier networks, enterprise cloud platforms, content distribution networks, and other mission-critical applications. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  3

 


o | Cellular Tower Providers: Owners of cellular towers, the physical infrastructure upon which antennas and associated equipment are co-located for the wireless carrier industry. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Users of Infrastructure. Users of infrastructure may purchase infrastructure services either to provide value-added services to their customers or for their own private network requirements. We further categorize these users of infrastructure as follows: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Communications Service Providers. Communication service providers, such as wireless service providers, ILECs, CLECs, and ISPs, are companies that use infrastructure to package, market, and sell value-added communications services such as voice, Internet, data, video, wireless, and hosting solutions. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | End Users. End users are public sector entities and private enterprises that purchase infrastructure services for their own internal networks. Note that end users may also address their needs by purchasing value-added services from communications service providers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The Market Opportunity
 The proliferation of smart devices and mobile broadband, real-time streaming video, social networks, online gaming, machine-to-machine connectivity, big data analytics, and cloud computing will continue to drive substantial consumer and business demand for bandwidth. Cisco estimates that mobile data traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 47% from 2016 to 2021 and that IP traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 24% from 2016 to 2021.
 Communications service providers develop and deliver value-added solutions that are tailored to mass market residential and enterprise customers whose needs continue to grow and evolve as bandwidth trends expand. Given this rapid growth and the complexity and cost of building and maintaining networks, communications service providers are increasingly looking to bandwidth infrastructure providers to augment the reach and performance of their own networks and support the delivery of the services their customers demand. As this dynamic continues, bandwidth infrastructure providers will become further entrenched as mission-critical partners to the communications service providers.
 Similarly, end users such as private enterprises (e.g., media/content providers, financial institutions, and hospital systems) and public sector entities (e.g., governmental agencies and school districts) have experienced significant growth and change in the role that bandwidth plays within their organizations. As these needs continue to grow in both volume and criticality, end users will increasingly choose to directly procure bandwidth infrastructure services in order to gain more security, control and scale in their internal network operations. An example of this disintermediation is the trend of large school districts, adapting to e-education requirements, directly purchasing dark fiber as a replacement to more value-added solutions. We believe that, as these dynamics play out across all industries, the number of end users directly seeking bandwidth infrastructure services will continue to expand.
 By focusing on the reach, density, and performance of their physical networks, bandwidth infrastructure providers can deliver customized services to communications service providers and end users more quickly and with superior economics than these users could otherwise self-provide. Whether providing fiber connectivity to a wireless provider’s towers to enable mobile broadband, supplying a national communications service provider with a metro fiber footprint in new markets, providing a lit bandwidth connection to multiple enterprise data centers for an industrial company, providing interconnection capabilities to a hosting company within a data center, or solving for the next society-impacting innovation, bandwidth infrastructure providers will continue to invest in and expand their infrastructure assets to meet this growing demand.
 Given the natural economies of scale, there has been significant consolidation among bandwidth infrastructure providers, particularly in the U.S. We believe this consolidation trend will continue in the U.S. and is beginning in Europe and Canada. Combined with the barriers to new entrants, we foresee a decreasing number of bandwidth infrastructure providers against a backdrop of continued strong demand for their services.
 Our Bandwidth Infrastructure Assets
 Our bandwidth infrastructure assets consist of our fiber networks, the optronic equipment used to provide our lit services over our fiber networks, and our data centers where we provide colocation and interconnection services.

 Our Fiber Networks
 Our network footprint includes both large and small metro geographies, the extended suburban regions of many cities, and the large rural, national and international fiber links that connect our metro networks. We believe that our network assets would be difficult to replicate given the geographic reach, network density, and capital investment required. Our fiber networks span over 123,841 route miles and 10,438,246 fiber miles (representing an average of 84 fibers per route), serve approximately 391 geographic markets in the United States, Canada and Europe, and connect approximately 31,000 buildings, including approximately 7,500 cellular towers and 1,141 data centers. Our networks allow us to provide our high-bandwidth infrastructure services to our customers over redundant fiber facilities between critical customer locations. We believe the location and density of our expansive network footprint allow us to more competitively service our target customers’ bandwidth infrastructure needs at the local, regional, national, and international level relative to other regional bandwidth infrastructure service providers or long-haul carriers. Our fiber networks also have the following key attributes:
· | Extensive Coverage. Our fiber networks are located across large and small metro geographies, the extended metro and suburban regions of many cities, and traverse large rural areas to connect metro markets. This network coverage allows us to address our target customers’ needs in a variety of geographies and for a variety of applications, all while remaining “on-net” and maintaining infrastructure economics. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Scalable Network Architecture. Our networks are scalable, meaning we often have spare fiber, conduit access rights and/or rights of way that allow us to continue to add capacity to our network as our customers’ demand for our services increases. In addition, the majority of our core fiber network segments utilize DWDM systems, nearly all of which have spare capacity through which we can continue to add wavelengths to our network without consuming additional fiber. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Modern Fiber and Optronics. Our modern fiber networks support current generation optronic equipment including DWDM systems, carrier class Ethernet switches and IP routers. This equipment is used to provide our lit services. The vast majority of our networks are capable of supporting next generation technologies with minimal capital investment. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Metro Fiber Networks.    We use our metro fiber networks to provide bandwidth infrastructure services within the metro markets that we serve. Our metro networks are most commonly used in the following two scenarios.  First, to provide service between on-net buildings that are located in the same geographic market. Second, to connect our on-net buildings within a metro market to another metro market via our regional and/or long-haul networks. We continue to expand our metro fiber networks within the metro geography and into the surrounding suburban areas as we extend to additional buildings to meet new demand on a success basis. Success-based expansion means that before we commit resources to expand our network, we have a signed customer contract that will provide us with an attractive return on required capital. In many of our metro markets, we have high count fiber cables (sometimes as many as 864 fibers per cable) and in some cases multiple spare conduits on our metro fiber routes. On individual segments where our fiber capacity becomes highly utilized, we seek to augment that capacity also on a success basis.
 Regional and Long-haul Fiber Networks.    We use our regional fiber networks to provide bandwidth infrastructure services between the metro markets that we serve. Our regional and long-haul networks are most commonly used in the following three scenarios.  First, to provide service between on-net buildings that are located in different large markets (for example, Chicago and New York). Second, to connect our on-net buildings in small and mid-sized markets back to major data centers, wireless switching centers, and carrier hotels in larger markets (for example, between Lima, Ohio and Cleveland, Ohio). Third, occasionally our networks provide service between on-net buildings in two different small or mid-sized markets located on various parts of our regional networks (for example, between Sioux Falls, South Dakota and Alexandria, Minnesota). We seek to continue to add new segments and markets to our regional and long-haul networks on a success basis, supported by a customer contract. We have deployed current generation DWDM technologies across the majority of our regional and long-haul networks, allowing a current maximum scaling to four terabytes (i.e. 4,000G) of bandwidth and the ability to add capacity as demand for bandwidth increases. We expect that as technology continues to advance, we will augment and invest in our regional and long-haul networks accordingly.
 Fiber-to-the-Tower Networks.    We operate fiber-to-the-tower networks across our fiber network footprint and connect to approximately 7,500 cellular towers. These FTT networks provide our customers with bandwidth infrastructure services that offer significantly improved speed, scale, performance and service levels relative to legacy 

 
  5

 
copper and microwave networks. Our FTT networks are scalable, which means that we can quickly and easily increase the amount of bandwidth that we provide to each of the towers as our customers’ wireless data networks grow. Our FTT markets are generally in areas where we already have dense fiber networks (either metro or regional), which affords us the ability to offer ring-protected mobile infrastructure services. We are increasingly providing dark fiber services on our FTT networks.
 Through these fiber networks, we provide service to approximately 31,000 on-net buildings and are continually making success-based capital investments to increase our on-net building footprint. On-net buildings are buildings that are directly connected via fiber to our long-haul, regional, metro, and FTT networks. Our customers generally purchase our bandwidth infrastructure services to transport their data, Internet, wireless and voice traffic between buildings directly connected to our network. The types of buildings connected to our network primarily consist of the following:

· | Data Centers, Carrier Hotels and Central Offices. These buildings house multiple consumers of bandwidth infrastructure services, serving as telecommunications and content exchange points. Our fiber networks generally connect the most important of these buildings in the markets where we operate. We have over 1,900 of these types of facilities connected to our network. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Single-Tenant, High-Bandwidth Locations. Generally these are other telecom, media or Internet content buildings that house a single large consumer of bandwidth infrastructure services. Examples of these buildings include video aggregation sites, mobile switching centers and carrier POPs. Our network is connected to these buildings only when the tenant is a customer. We currently have over 3,300 single-tenant, high-bandwidth locations on-net. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cellular Towers. We connect to cellular towers and other locations that house wireless antennas. We have approximately 7,500 cellular towers on-net. Typically, towers have multiple tenants, which provides us with the opportunity to sell services to those additional tenants. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enterprise Buildings. Our network extends to over 19,600 enterprise buildings. This grouping contains a mix of single-tenant and multi-tenant enterprise buildings and includes hospitals, corporate data centers, schools, government buildings, research centers and other key corporate locations that require bandwidth infrastructure services. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our Data Centers

Many of our data center facilities are located in some of the most important carrier hotels in North America, including 60 Hudson Street and 111 8th Avenue in New York; 165 Halsey Street in Newark; 401 N. Broad Street in Philadelphia; 1 Summer Street in Boston; 1950 N. Stemmons Freeway and 2323 Bryan Street in Dallas; 2001 6th Street in Seattle; and 151 Front Street in Toronto. We have the exclusive right to operate and provide colocation and interconnection services in the Meet-Me Room at 60 Hudson Street. We also have colocation facilities located in Atlanta, Ashburn, Austin, Amsterdam, Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Memphis, Miami, Minneapolis, Montreal, Nashville, Paris, Phoenix, San Diego, Santa Clara, Toronto and four additional locations in Europe. All of our facilities are network-neutral, have ample power to meet customer needs, backup power in the form of batteries and generators, air conditioning, modern fire suppression equipment, 24/7 security and equipment monitoring, and redundant cooling capabilities. We have long-term leases with the owners of each of the buildings where we provide colocation services. Our colocation facilities total approximately 870,000 square feet of billable colocation space. Underlying Rights
 We have the necessary right-of-way agreements and other required rights, including state and federal government authorization, to allow us to maintain and expand our fiber networks that are located on private property and public rights-of-way, including utility poles. When we expand our network, we obtain the necessary construction permits, license agreements, permits and franchise agreements. Certain of these permits, licenses and franchises are for a limited duration. When we need to use private property, our strategy is to obtain rights-of-way under long-term contracts. Our Segments and Services
 We provide high-bandwidth infrastructure services over our extensive metro, regional, and long-haul fiber networks and through our interconnect-oriented datacenter facilities.  We provide our products and services through our six operating segments: Fiber Solutions, Transport, Enterprise Networks, Zayo Colocation (zColo), Allstream and Other.    

 
  6

 
Across our segments, we operate individual Strategic Product Groups (“SPGs”). Each SPG has financial accountability and decision-making authority, which promotes agility in the fast-moving markets we serve. Financial information for each of our operating segments and our domestic and foreign operations is contained in Note 15 – Segment Reporting to our consolidated financial statements.
  Fiber Solutions.  Through the Fiber Solutions segment, we provide raw bandwidth infrastructure to customers that require more control of their internal networks. These services include dark fiber, dedicated lit networks and mobile infrastructure (fiber-to-the-tower and small cell). Dark fiber is a physically separate and secure, private platform for dedicated bandwidth. The Company leases dark fiber pairs (usually 2 to 12 total fibers) to our customers, who “light” the fiber using their own optronics. Our mobile infrastructure services provide direct fiber connections to cell towers, small cells, hub sites, and mobile switching centers. Fiber Solutions customers include carriers and other communication service providers, Internet service providers, wireless service providers, major media and content companies, large enterprises, and other companies that have the expertise to run their own fiber optic networks or require interconnected technical space. The contract terms in the Fiber Solutions segment tend to range from three to twenty years.    Transport. The Transport segment provides lit bandwidth infrastructure solutions over our metro, regional, and long-haul fiber networks. The segment uses optronics to light the fiber, and our customers pay for service based on the amount and type of bandwidth they purchase. Our services within this segment include wavelengths, wholesale IP services and SONET. We target customers who require a minimum of 10G of bandwidth across their networks. Transport customers include carriers, content providers, financial services companies, healthcare, government entities, education institutions and other medium and large enterprises. The contract terms in this segment tend to range from two to five years.  SPGs within the Transport segment include: 

· | Zayo Wavelength Services (“Waves”). Through our Waves SPG, we provide lit bandwidth infrastructure services to customers by using optical wavelength technology. The service is provided by using DWDM optronic equipment to “multiplex” multiple channels (i.e., wavelengths) of dedicated capacity on a single fiber pair. The wavelength group provides its services in speeds of 1G, 2.5G, 10G, 40G, and 100G. Customers include carriers, financial services companies, healthcare, government institutions, education institutions and other enterprises. Services are typically provided for terms between one and five years for a fixed recurring monthly fee and in some cases an additional upfront, non-recurring fee. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Internet Protocol (“IP”) Transit. The IP Transit SPG provides lit bandwidth infrastructure services to its customers utilizing Internet Protocol technology. IP technology transports data across multiple circuits over a shared infrastructure from the customer source to the customer required destination. Information leaving the source is divided into multiple packets and each packet traverses the network utilizing the most efficient path and means available, as determined by a network of IP routers. Packets of information may travel across different physical circuits or paths in order to reach the destination, at which point the packets are reassembled to form the complete communication. Services are generally used to exchange or access traffic on the public Internet. Services are provided in speeds ranging from 10Mb to 100G on a single customer port interface. Customers include regional telecommunications and cable carriers, ISPs, enterprises, educational institutions and content companies. Services are typically provided for terms between one and three years for a fixed recurring monthly fee and in some cases a usage-based and/or an additional upfront, non-recurring fee. Pricing is generally a function of bandwidth capacity and transport required to carry traffic from the customer location to a public Internet exchange. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Zayo SONET Services. Our SONET Services SPG provides lit bandwidth infrastructure services to its customers utilizing SONET technology. SONET is a standardized protocol that transfers multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. SONET technology is often used to support private line services. This protocol enables transmission of voice, data and video at high speeds. SONET networks are protected, which provides for virtually instantaneous restoration of service in the event of a fiber cut or equipment failure. Services are provided in speeds ranging from DS-1 (1.54Mb) to OC-192 (10G) of capacity. Customers in this group are largely carriers. Services are typically provided for terms between one and five years for a fixed recurring monthly fee and in some cases an additional upfront, non-recurring fee. SONET is generally a legacy product that is gradually being replaced by Ethernet, wavelength and dark fiber services. As a result, the SONET SPG generally manages its business to maximize cash generation and deploys minimal growth capital.

Enterprise Networks. The Enterprise Networks segment provides communication solutions to medium and large enterprises. Our services within this segment include Ethernet, enterprise private and connectivity services, managed services and cloud based compute and storage products. Solutions range from point-to-point data connections to multi-site managed networks to international outsourced IT infrastructure environments.  SPGs within the Enterprise Networks segment include:

· | Zayo Ethernet Services. Our Ethernet Services SPG provides lit bandwidth infrastructure services to its customers utilizing Ethernet technology. Ethernet services are offered in metro markets as well as between metro areas (intercity) in point-to-point and multi-point configurations. Unlike data transmission over a dedicated wavelength network, information transmitted over Ethernet is transferred in a packet or frame across the network. The frame enables the data to navigate across a shared infrastructure in order to reach the customer required destination. Services are provided in speeds ranging from 10Mb to 10G. Customers include carriers, financial services companies, healthcare, government institutions, education institutions and other enterprises. Services are typically provided for terms between one and five years for a fixed recurring monthly fee and in some cases an additional upfront, non-recurring fee. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enterprise Private and Connectivity (“EPIC”). Our EPIC SPG provides lit bandwidth infrastructure services to its customers utilizing Internet Protocol and managed Wide Area Network (“WAN”) technology. Services are generally used to exchange or access traffic on the public Internet and include Dedicated Internet Access (“DIA”), IP Virtual Private Networks (“VPN”) and Distributed Denial of Service (“DDos”) mitigation services. Services are typically provided for terms between one and ten years for a fixed recurring monthly fee and in some cases an additional upfront, non-recurring fee. Pricing is generally a function of bandwidth capacity and transport required to carry traffic from customer location to an Internet gateway. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During Fiscal 2017, we changed our reportable segments. With the continued increase in our scope and scale, effective January 1, 2017, our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), who is our Chief Executive Officer, implemented certain organizational changes to the management and operation of the business that directly impact how the CODM makes resource allocation decisions and manages the Company. The change in structure had the impact of revising our reportable segments and re-aligning our existing SPGs within these segments.  The change in structure also had the impact of consolidating and/or regrouping existing SPGs and product offerings among our reportable segments and disaggregating the legacy Zayo Canada segment among the existing SPGs and a new Allstream reportable segment.  The change in structure also resulted in adjustments to intercompany pricing which more closely align to third party pricing on the services which are provided between our SPGs. 
 Our legacy SPGs included Dark Fiber and Mobile Infrastructure Group (“MIG”).  Effective January 1, 2017, the Dark Fiber and MIG SPGs were merged together and are now reported as part of the Fiber Solutions reporting segment.  Waves and Ethernet services that are provided on dedicated dark fiber strands and colocation facilities that support only dark fiber customers which were historically reported as part of the Waves, Ethernet or zColo SPGs were transferred to the Fiber Solutions reportable segment effective January 1, 2017 (the “Dedicated Services Transfers”).
 Our legacy Waves, IP and Sonet SPGs, after giving effect to the Dedicated Services Transfers, are now reported under the Company’s Transport reportable segment.
 Our legacy Ethernet and Cloud SPGs, after giving effect to the Dedicated Services Transfers, are now reported under the Company’s Enterprise Networks segment.
 Our legacy Zayo Canada reporting segment was disaggregated based upon the products offered by the legacy Zayo Canada segment to our existing SPGs and two new SPGs were established: Voice and SMB.
 All prior period segment level financial and operating metrics included in this Annual Report have been recast to conform to the current period presentation for comparability.
 Our Operations
 Network Management and Operations
 Our primary network operating center (“NOC”) is located in Tulsa, Oklahoma and provides 24 hours per day, 365 days per year monitoring and network surveillance. As part of our business continuity plan, our primary NOC is backed up by several regional operations centers located in Washington, D.C.; Allentown, Pennsylvania; and Butte, Montana. We continually monitor for, and proactively respond to, any events that negatively impact or interrupt the services that we provide to our customers. Our NOC also responds to customer network inquiries via standard customer trouble ticket procedures. Our NOC coordinates and notifies our customers of maintenance activities and is the organization responsible for ensuring that we meet our service level agreements. Information Technology
 Our Information Technology systems have been designed and built specifically for the needs of a focused bandwidth infrastructure provider primarily leveraging the salesforce.com platform. This platform was adopted at our inception and has been enhanced over time to integrate all of our acquired companies and increase functionality in every area.
 Our current systems’ capability is mature, and we view our application functionality as a competitive advantage in our industry. Our system is differentiated from the typical telecom industry technology solution consisting of separate and loosely integrated sales force automation, customer relationship management, provisioning, mapping, inventory, financial, provisioning and other systems with multiple, sometimes conflicting databases.
 We have also developed within our salesforce.com platform a proprietary capability we call Tranzact. Tranzact is a set of tools and processes designed to enhance the speed and simplicity of procuring bandwidth infrastructure services. We believe Tranzact will further increase our competitive advantage in delivering bandwidth infrastructure solutions.

 We have a fully implemented business continuity and disaster recovery plan that provides near real-time data access from physically diverse data centers (Dallas and Washington, D.C.). We further protect our data with off-site data storage practices.
 Our Sales and Marketing Organization
 Our business primarily engages in direct sales through our sales organization, consisting of 250 sales representatives as of June 30, 2017. Each of these sales representatives is part of an enterprise or carrier focused sales team led by a sales director whose team is responsible for meeting a set of quarterly bookings targets. The sales organization sells services across all our SPGs. The sales representatives are directly supported by sales management, engineering, solutions engineering and marketing staff.
 The sales organization is organized into direct sales channels that generally align around both region and customer. Each of these channels maintains dedicated sales and solutions engineering support resources. There are three direct sales channels in North America and one in Europe, each of which are geographically focused supporting key customers, particularly in the financial, webscale, media and gaming, data center, and government verticals. In addition to those regional channels, there are dedicated teams focused on our wireline and wireless customers and ecosystem across all geographies. 
 In addition to the direct channels discussed above, an indirect sales channel manages our channel partner program with various high value telecom sales agents. 
 Our direct sales force is compensated through a unique system relative to typical industry practices. Sales staff are compensated through salary and incentive compensation, which is comprised of cash and equity.  Incentive compensation is achieved based upon the net present value (“NPV”) of the contracted services sold, the incremental revenue related to contracted services sold and the effective management of churn related to the accounts they manage. We believe that this compensation system best aligns the interests of our salespeople, management and our stockholders. It also is an example of the financial philosophy and culture that we have developed since our inception
 Separate from the sales groups, we have a corporate marketing group that is responsible for our web presence, customer facing mapping tools, marketing campaigns, and public relations. The sales organization is further supported by product management teams that are organized into the SPGs.
 Our Customers
 Our customers generally have a significant and growing need for the bandwidth infrastructure services that we provide. Our customer base consists of wireless service providers, carriers and other communication service providers, media and content companies (including cable and satellite video providers), and other bandwidth-intensive businesses in the education, healthcare, financial services, governmental and technology entities. Our largest single customer, based on recurring revenue, accounted for approximately 8% of our revenue during the year ended June 30, 2017, and total revenues from our top ten customers accounted for approximately 27% of our revenue during the same period. These customers are multinational organizations with substantial liquidity and access to capital, and whose bandwidth needs are mission-critical to their own businesses and strategies. While these large customers generally have a finite set of master contracts with us, they procure a large volume of individual services with us, each of which has its own service detail and term.
 The majority of our customers sign Master Service Agreements (“MSAs”) that contain standard terms and conditions including service level agreements, required response intervals, indemnification, default, force majeure, assignment and notification, limitation of liability, confidentiality and other key terms and conditions. Most MSAs also contain appendices that contain information that is specific to each of the services that we provide. The MSAs either have exhibits that contain service orders or, alternatively, terms for services ordered are set forth in a separate service order. Each service order sets forth the minimum contract duration, the monthly recurring charge, and the non-recurring charges.
 Our Business Strategy
 In pursuit of our mission, our Business Strategy includes the following key elements:

· | Focus on Bandwidth Infrastructure. We expect that bandwidth needs for mobile applications, cloud-based computing, and machine-to-machine connectivity will continue to grow with the continued adoption of bandwidth-intensive devices, as well as the escalating demand for Internet-delivered video. We focus on providing high-bandwidth infrastructure solutions, which we believe are essential in the 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  10

 

consumption and delivery of bandwidth-intensive applications and services by enterprise customers and communications service providers. We believe our disciplined approach to providing these critical services to our targeted customers enables us to offer a high level of customer service, while at the same time being responsive to changes in the marketplace.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Target Large Consumers of Bandwidth. Our asset base and product suite are geared for large consumers of bandwidth with high connectivity requirements. The majority of our customers require more than 10G of bandwidth; many of our customers require multiple terabytes of bandwidth. Our revenue base is generally characterized by customers with a high bandwidth spend, consisting of a large number of individual services and increasing bandwidth infrastructure service demand. Tailoring our operations around these products, services and customers allows us to operate efficiently and meet these large consumers’ requirements for mission-critical infrastructure. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leverage Our Extensive Asset Base by Selling Services on Our Network. Targeting our sales efforts to services that utilize our existing fiber networks and data centers enables us to limit our reliance on third-party service providers. We believe this in turn produces high incremental margins, which helps us expand consolidated margins, achieve attractive returns on the capital we invest, and realize significant levered free cash flow. We also believe this enables us to provide our customers with a superior level of customer service due to the relative ease in responding to customer service inquiries over one contiguous fiber network. Our existing networks enable us to sell additional bandwidth to our existing customers as their capacity needs grow. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to Expand Our Infrastructure Assets. Our ability to rapidly add network capacity to meet the growing requirements of our customers is an important component of our value proposition. We will continue to seek opportunities to expand our network footprint where supporting customer contracts provide an attractive return on our investment. The expansion of our network footprint also provides the ancillary benefit of bringing other potential customer locations within reach. We design our networks with additional capacity so that increasing bandwidth capacity can be deployed economically and efficiently. Capital expenditures are primarily success-based. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leverage Our Existing Relationships and Assets to Innovate. We believe we possess a unique set of assets and management systems designed to deliver customer solutions tailored to specific trends we observe in the marketplace. Our high-energy, entrepreneurial culture fosters employee innovation on an ongoing basis in response to specific customer requirements. Furthermore, we plan to continue to commit capital to new lines of infrastructure businesses that leverage our existing assets. For example, we are expanding into small cell infrastructure services provided to wireless services providers. These services entail us providing dark fiber and related services from a small cell location back to a mobile switching center. We provide the fiber-based transport over our existing and/or newly constructed fiber networks. In addition, we provide network-neutral space and power for wireless service providers to co-locate their small cell antennas and ancillary equipment. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Intelligently Expand Through Acquisitions. We have made 41 acquisitions to date for an aggregate purchase price, net of cash, of $6.5 billion. We believe we have consistently demonstrated an ability to acquire and effectively integrate companies, realize cost synergies, and organically grow revenue post-acquisition. Acquisitions have the ability to increase the scale of our operations, which in turn affords us the ability to expand our operating leverage, extend our network reach, and broaden our customer base. We believe our ability to realize significant cost synergies through acquisitions provides us with a competitive advantage in future consolidation opportunities within our industry. We will continue to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities and are regularly involved in acquisition discussions. We will evaluate these opportunities based on a number of criteria, including expected return on capital, the quality of the infrastructure assets, the fit within our existing businesses, the opportunity to expand our network, and the opportunity to create value through the realization of cost synergies.

  Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe the following are among our core competitive strengths and enable us to differentiate ourselves in the markets we serve:

· | Unique Bandwidth Infrastructure Assets. We believe replicating our extensive metro, regional, and long-haul fiber assets would be difficult given the significant capital, time, permitting, and expertise

required. Our fiber spans over 123,841 route miles and 10,438,246 fiber miles (representing an average of 84 fibers per route), served 391 geographic markets in the United States, Canada and Europe, and connect to approximately 31,000 buildings. The majority of the markets that we serve and buildings to which we connect have few other networks capable of providing similar high-bandwidth infrastructure and connectivity solutions, which we believe provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage in these markets, and positions us as a mission-critical infrastructure supplier to the largest users of bandwidth. We believe that the vast majority of customers using our network, including our lit bandwidth, fiber-to-the-tower, and dark fiber customers, choose our services due to the quality and reach of our network, and the ability our network gives us to innovate and scale with their growing bandwidth needs. Additionally, we operate 49 data center facilities, which are located in eleven of the most important carrier hotels in the U.S., Canada and France. This collective presence, combined with our high network density, creates a network effect that helps us retain existing customers and attract new customers. From July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2017, exclusive of acquisitions, we have invested approximately $2.1 billion of capital in our networks, including expansion and maintenance expenditures.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong Revenue Growth, Visibility, and Durability. We have consistently grown our organic revenue, as gross installed revenue has exceeded churn processed in every quarter since we began reporting in March 2010. We believe our exposure to the enduring trend of increasing bandwidth consumption, combined with our focused execution, have allowed us to achieve this consistent growth. We typically provide our bandwidth infrastructure services for a fixed monthly recurring fee under multi-year contracts. Our contract terms range from one year to twenty years. Our customers use our bandwidth infrastructure to support their mission-critical networks and applications. The switching costs and effort required to replace our services can be high, particularly for the services within our Fiber Solutions and Transport segments, given the criticality of our services and the potential cost and disruption. We believe that increasing bandwidth needs combined with the mission-critical nature of our services provided under multi-year contracts create strong revenue growth, visibility, and durability, which support our decision-making abilities and financial stability. We believe that our industry’s high barriers to entry, our economies of scale and scope and customer switching costs contribute to our strong financial performance.

· | Customer Service and Ability to Innovate for Our Customers. Our sales and product professionals work closely with potential and existing customers to design tailored high-bandwidth connectivity solutions across our SPGs to meet specific, varying, and evolving customer needs. We are focused on delivering high-quality, reliable service to our customers. We achieve this by leveraging our contiguous network to expand with our customers as they seek to build scale, coverage, and/or performance. Additionally, our focus on serving the largest and most sophisticated users of bandwidth keeps our sales, engineering, and service organizations attuned to the latest technologies, architectures, and solutions that our customers may seek to implement. We believe our willingness to innovate for our customers and our dedication to customer service help establish our position as an important infrastructure supplier and allow us to attract new customers and businesses, sell an increasing amount of services to our existing customers, and reduce customer turnover. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strategic, Operational and Financial Transparency Excellence. As part of our strategy to serve the largest users of bandwidth, we have completed and integrated 41 acquisitions to date. Our acquired assets have been combined to create a contiguous network with the ability to provision and maintain local, regional, national, or international high-bandwidth connections across our SPGs. Our entire network, sales and churn activity, installation pipeline, NPV commission plans, and all customer contracts are managed through an integrated operating and reporting platform, which gives management strong visibility into the business and improves our ability to drive return-maximizing decisions throughout the organization. Our focus on operational and financial transparency not only allows us to be very nimble in attacking various market opportunities, but also provides us the ability to deliver disclosure that our stockholders and other stakeholders can use to accurately judge management’s performance from a capital allocation, financial, and operational perspective.

· | Financially Focused and Entrepreneurial Culture. Virtually all operational and financial decisions we make are driven by the standard of maximizing the value of our enterprise. Our sales commission plans use an NPV-based approach with the goal of encouraging the proper behavior within our sales force, and our SPGs are held to group level equity internal rate of return (“IRR”) targets set by management.

align individual behaviors with stockholder objectives, equity compensation is used throughout the Company, and our compensation plans include a larger equity component than we believe is standard in our industry. In addition to striving for industry-leading operational and growth outcomes to drive value creation, we are prepared to use debt capacity to enhance stockholder returns, but not at the expense of other stakeholders and only at levels we believe are in the long-term interests of the Company, our customers, and our stockholders. Finally, our owners’ manual, mission, and investor transparency all serve to enhance cultural alignment across the Company and our stockholders. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Experienced Management with Unique Leadership Approach. We have assembled an experienced management team that we believe is well-qualified to lead our Company and execute our strategy. Our management team has substantial industry experience in managing and designing fiber networks and network-neutral colocation and interconnection facilities and in selling and marketing bandwidth infrastructure services. In addition, our management team has significant experience in acquiring and integrating bandwidth infrastructure and assets. Our management team is a cohesive unit with a common history that in many cases precedes the Company’s founding. We also believe that our approach to leadership - operationally, financially, culturally - is unique in our industry and differentiates us from our competitors.

  Our Competition
 Fiber Solutions 
 Given the requirement to own the underlying bandwidth infrastructure assets (e.g., fiber networks) in order to provide dark fiber solutions services, the competitive environment tends to be less intensive for these products and the barriers to entry high. The degree of competition and parties in competition vary by physical infrastructure sub-service and by individual market and fiber route. 
 Competition in dark fiber services tends to be less intense than for lit bandwidth infrastructure services primarily because a provider must predominantly own and operate a high count fiber network covering a substantial portion of the geographical demand in order to compete for a customer’s business. The uniqueness, density and depth (i.e., high fiber count) of our metro, regional, and long-haul fiber networks is therefore a key differentiating factor. In addition, given that providing dark fiber services often includes some degree of network expansion, dark fiber providers must also have internal project management expertise and access to capital to execute on the expansion aspect of the business. Due to the custom nature of most dark fiber opportunities, many larger lit bandwidth infrastructure providers do not actively market dark fiber as a product, even if they own fiber networks in the desired geographies. As a result, competition is often more limited in the dark fiber services market and highly dependent on the local (even sub-market) supply and demand environment. Given this dynamic and the generally longer contractual term of dark fiber services, dark fiber pricing tends to be more inflationary in nature.
 Specific dark fiber competitors vary significantly based on geography, and often a particular solution can be provided by only one to three carriers that have sufficient fiber in place in the desired area or route. Historically, these competitors have fallen into two categories: first, privately owned regional bandwidth infrastructure providers with a similar degree of focus (e.g., Lightower) and second, single market dark fiber providers with market and fiber construction expertise (e.g., DQE Communications and Edison Carrier Solutions). More recently other multi-geography competitors have emerged due to acquisitions in the industry (e.g.,Crown Castle and Uniti).
 Competition in mobile infrastructure services tends to mirror dark fiber services because of the need to own and operate an expansive and deep metro fiber network in order to compete. Given the frequent need to expand upon an existing fiber footprint in order to access additional cell towers and small cell locations, project management expertise and access to capital is also a key competitive factor. One additional criterion is that wireless carriers prefer to work with a more finite group of mobile infrastructure providers on either a metro or regional geographic basis. As a result, the competitive group tends to match that of dark fiber services, with the addition of two competitive groups. First, local cable providers and ILECs who will sometimes break from their retail and small enterprise core focus to compete for FTT business, often as a result of legacy copper or coaxial-based services provided to these towers. Second, microwave backhaul providers who focus on more remote or rural towers that have lesser bandwidth needs that they can serve with less capital-intensive (and less bandwidth-capable) microwave solutions at a lower total cost. Examples of these additional mobile infrastructure competitors are Comcast, CenturyLink, Crown Castle, Conterra and Mobilitie.

 
  13

 

 Transport
 We believe that some of the key factors that influence our customers’ selection of us as their transport provider are our ability to provide an on-net service that utilizes our fiber network on an end-to-end basis, the availability of high capacity services up to 100G or higher as optical technology advances, the uniqueness, quantity and latency of available intercity and metro routes, the peering capacity and reach of our IP network, the price of the service provided, and the ongoing level of network availability provided.
 Generally, price competition varies depending on the location of the service endpoints and carrier uniqueness of network assets. We face direct price competition when there are other fiber-based carriers who have intercity networks that leverage similar fiber routes with similar end to end route latency. Often a particular solution can be provided by only one to three carriers that have comparable network reach in place. Typically, these competitors are publicly traded communications service providers that provide bandwidth infrastructure, such as Level 3 Communications, Inc., TeliaSonera, or Cogent Communications, or in certain geographies are privately-held companies such as Windstream or EU Networks.  We may also compete with large, well-capitalized ILECs, such as AT&T Inc. and CenturyLink, Inc., who have a well established and global IP offering. We believe that price competition will continue where our competitors have comparable existing fiber and optical networks. Some of our competitors have long-standing customer relationships, very large enterprise values, and significant access to capital.
 Enterprise Networks

Enterprise Networks is focused on offering network connectivity, cloud and cyber security solutions to large multi-site enterprises. The competition is intense and varied for the enterprise IT business and the specific competitors based on each of the service categories and geographies. Our key challenges range from aggressive pricing to an evolving competitive field with the completion of each new merger or acquisition. 

From a network connectivity perspective, our competitors range from well-capitalized ILECs such as AT&T Inc., CenturyLink, Inc./Level3, and Verizon Communications Inc/XO, or publicly traded communications service providers that provide bandwidth infrastructure, such as Cogent and Windstream. In some geographies, we also compete with Lightower, GTT and Comcast. For cloud services our competition also varies depending on the type of service. For example, we compete with Dell EMC, HPE and NetApp in the Private Cloud market but we compete with AWS and Rackspace and smaller cloud service providers for Object-Based Storage business. In the area of cybersecurity, the competitive field is vast and specialized and will vary depending on the specific security need ranging from infrastructure security, endpoint security, application security, managed security to threat analysis and protection, Internet of Things and data security to name a few.
    
Many of our competitors in the enterprise market are well established with long-standing relationships and we must compete in a variety of aspects as enterprise IT buyers are tech savvy and well informed. As an example, purchasers of network services generally base their decisions on the best value, which includes price, route (diversity and latency), flexibility, and customer service perspective. Two of our key competitive challenges are brand recognition and product set awareness. However, we believe we are very competitive when we can communicate our capabilities that include our dense, global fiber network, our ability to implement complex custom solutions and our responsive customer service at a price that meets the customer’s budget. With Enterprise Networks, we believe we can aggressively compete with the short list of single source global providers.
     zColo
 The market for our colocation and interconnection services is very competitive. We compete based on location, quality of service, network-neutrality, breadth of network connectivity options, type and quantity of customers in our data centers, and location. We compete against both large, public colocation providers who have significant enterprise values, and privately-held, well-funded colocation providers. Some of our competitors have longer-standing customer relationships and significantly greater access to capital, which may enable them to materially increase data center space, and therefore lower overall market pricing for such services. Several of our competitors have much larger colocation facilities in the markets where we operate. Others operate globally and are able to attract a customer base that values and requires global reach and scale.

 
  14

 

 These focused interconnection and colocation service providers include:  Equinix, ‎Coresite, Cologix, Peak 10, Digital Realty Trust Inc, and QTS Realty Trust Inc. These companies offer similar services and operate in similar markets to us.
 Allstream
 Allstream serves business customers throughout the United States and Canada.  Its communications technologies and services include a range of scalable IP, cloud, voice and data solutions that help organizations communicate and collaborate more efficiently and profitably. Our largest competitors in Canada are the incumbent telecommunications companies Bell, TELUS and Rogers.  Our largest U.S. competitors are Masergy, Comcast, WAVE, CenturyLink and Verizon.  We also compete with other telecommunications companies, such as established cable and hydro companies, and smaller companies or re-sellers that have a more limited network.     Other
 We do not own any significant intellectual property, nor do we spend a material amount on research and development. Our working capital requirements and expansion needs have been satisfied to date through equity contributions, debt issuances, proceeds from our initial public offering (“IPO”) and follow-on equity offering, and cash provided by operating activities. Regulatory Matters
 Our operations require that certain of our subsidiaries hold licenses, certificates, and/or other regulatory authorizations from the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), state Public Utilities Commissions (“PUCs”), European and Canadian telecommunications regulators (such as, Ofcom and ARCEP in Europe and CRTC in Canada) and other foreign regulators, all of which we have obtained and maintain in the normal course of our business. The FCC, State PUCs and foreign regulators generally have the power to modify or terminate a carrier’s authority to provide regulated wireline services for failure to comply with certain federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, and may impose fines or other penalties for violations of the same. The State PUCs typically have similar powers with respect to the intrastate services that we provide under their jurisdiction. In addition, we are required to submit periodic reports to the FCC, State PUCs, and foreign regulators documenting interstate, intrastate and foreign revenue, among other data, for fee assessments and general regulatory governance, and in some states are required to file tariffs of our rates, terms, and conditions of service. In order to engage in certain transactions in these jurisdictions, including changes of control, the encumbrance of certain assets, the issuance of securities, the incurrence of indebtedness, the guarantee of indebtedness of other entities, including subsidiaries of ours, and the transfer of our assets, we are required to provide notice and/or obtain prior approval from certain of these governmental agencies. The construction of additions to our current fiber network is also subject to certain governmental permitting and licensing requirements.
 In addition, our business is subject to various other regulations at the federal, state, local and international levels. These regulations affect the way we can conduct our business and our costs of doing so. However, we believe, based on our examination of such existing and potential new regulations being considered in ongoing FCC and State PUC and European, Canadian and other foreign telecommunications proceedings, that such regulations will not have a significant impact on us.
