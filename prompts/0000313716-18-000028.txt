Products
We supply high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, grinding machines, machining centers, and repair parts related to those machines. The Company also engineers and supplies high precision, standard and specialty workholding devices, and other machine tool accessories. We believe our products are known for accuracy, reliability, durability, and value.
Segments
The Company has two unique business segments: Metalcutting Machine Solutions ("MMS") and Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories ("ATA"). For further information regarding financial information about our segments and geographic areas, refer to Note 17. "Segment Information" to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Metalcutting Machine Solutions (MMS)
This segment includes operations related to grinding, turning, and milling machines, as discussed below, and related repair parts and services. The products are considered to be capital goods with sales prices ranging from approximately thirty thousand dollars for some standard products to approximately two million dollars for specialized grinding machines or turnkey systems that are designed and built for specific customer needs. Sales are subject to economic cycles and, because they are often purchased to add manufacturing capacity, the cycles can be severe with customers delaying purchases during down cycles and then aggressively requiring machine deliveries during up cycles. Machines are purchased to a lesser extent during down cycles, as customers are looking for productivity improvements or they have new products that require new machining capabilities.
We have been a manufacturer of industrial-use high precision and general precision turning machine tools since 1890. Turning machines, or lathes, are power-driven machines used to remove material from either bar stock or a rough-formed part by moving multiple cutting tools against the surface of a part rotating at very high speeds in a spindle mechanism. The multi-directional movement of the cutting tools allows the part to be shaped to the desired dimensions. On parts produced by our machines, those dimensions are often measured in millionths of an inch. We consider Hardinge to be a leader in the field of producing machines capable of consistently and cost-effectively producing parts to very tight tolerances.
Grinding is a machining process in which a part's surface is shaped to tight tolerances with a rotating abrasive wheel or tool. Grinding machines can be used to finish parts of various shapes and sizes. The grinding machines of our Kellenberger subsidiary are used to grind the inside and outside diameters of cylindrical parts. Such grinding machines are typically used to provide a more exact finish on a part that has been partially completed on a lathe. The Kellenberger grinding machines are generally purchased by the same type of customers as other Hardinge equipment and further our ability to be a primary source for our customers.
Our Kellenberger precision grinding technology is complemented by our Hauser, Tschudin, Voumard, and Usach grinding brands. Hauser machines are jig grinders used to make demanding contour components, primarily for tool and mold-making applications. Tschudin product technology is focused on the specialized grinding of cylindrical parts when the customer requires high volume production. Our Tschudin machines are generally equipped with automatic loading and unloading mechanisms for the part being machined. These loading and unloading mechanisms significantly reduce machine operator involvement in the production process. Voumard machines are high quality internal diameter cylindrical grinding systems used in production and job shop environments. Usach builds special purpose machines for internal diameter, outer diameter, and multiple grinding processes mix of internal diameter and outer diameter. Usach typically sells the machines as a turnkey system with integrated automation and value added processes such as probe and measuring.
Milling machines (also known as machining centers) are designed to remove material from stationary, prismatic, or box-like parts of various shapes with rotating tools that are capable of milling, drilling, tapping, reaming, and routing. Machining centers have mechanisms that automatically change tools based on commands from an integrated computer control without the assistance of an operator. Machining centers are generally purchased by the same customers who purchase other Hardinge equipment. We supply a broad line of machining centers under our Bridgeport brand name addressing a range of sizes, speeds, and powers.
Our machines generally use commands from an integrated computer to control the movement of cutting tools, grinding wheels, part positioning, and in the case of turning and grinding machines, the rotation speeds of the part being shaped. The computer control enables the operator to program operations such as part rotation, tooling selection, and tooling movement for a specific part and then stores that program in memory for future use. The machines are able to produce parts 
5

while left unattended when connected to automatic bar-feeding, robotics equipment, or other material handling devices designed to supply raw materials and remove machined parts from the machine.
The introduction of new machines are critical to our growth plans. We gain access to new machine offerings through internal product development, acquisitions, joint ventures, license agreements, and partnerships. Products are introduced each year to broaden our product offering, to take advantage of new technologies available to us, and to replace older models nearing the end of their respective product life cycles. These technologies generally allow our machines to run at higher speeds and with more power, thus increasing their efficiency. Customers routinely replace old machines with newer machines that can produce parts faster and with less time to set up the machine when converting from one type of part to another. Generally, our machines can be used to produce parts from all of the standard ferrous and non-ferrous metals, as well as plastics, composites, and exotic materials.
We focus on products and solutions for companies making parts from hard to machine materials with tough to sustain, tight tolerances and difficult to attain surface finishes that may be hard to achieve with competitor machines. We believe that with our high precision and super precision lathes, our grinding machines, and our rugged machining centers, combined with our accessory products and our technical expertise, we are uniquely qualified to be the supplier of choice for customers manufacturing products to demanding specifications.
Multiple options are available on many of our machines, which allows customers to customize their machines to their specific operating performance and cost objectives. We produce machines for stock with popular option combinations for immediate delivery, as well as design and produce machines to specific customer requirements. In addition to our machines, we provide the necessary tooling, accessories, and support services to assist customers in maximizing their return on investment.
The sale of repair parts is important to our business. Certain parts on machines may need to be replaced due to normal wear over many operating cycles or improper operation of the machine. Customers will buy parts from us throughout the life of the machine, which typically extends over many years. There are thousands of machines in operation in the world for which we provide those repair parts and in many cases the parts are available exclusively from us.
We offer various warranties on our equipment and consider post-sale support to be a critical element of our business. Warranties on machines typically extend for twelve months after purchase. Services provided include operation and maintenance training, in-field maintenance, and in-field repair. We offer these post-sales support services on a paid basis throughout the life of the machine. In territories covered by distributors, this support and service is offered through the distributor.
Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories (ATA)
This segment includes products that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their machines. The selling prices of these units are relatively low per piece with prices ranging from forty dollars on high volume collets to two hundred thousand dollars or more for specialty chucks. While considered to be consumable, these products are more durable in nature, with replacement due to wear over time. Our products are used on all types and brands of machine tools, not limited to our own. Sales levels are affected by manufacturing cycles, but not as severely as capital goods lines. While customers may not purchase high cost machines during a down cycle, their factories are operating with their existing equipment and therefore accessories are still needed as they wear out or they are needed for a change in production requirements.
The two primary product groups in ATA are collets and chucks. Collets are cone-shaped metal sleeves used for holding circular or rod-like pieces in a lathe or other machine that provide effective part holding and accurate part location during machining operations. Chucks are a specialized clamping device used to hold an object with radial symmetry, especially a cylindrical object. It is most commonly used to hold a rotating work piece. Some of our specialty chucks can also hold irregularly shaped objects that lack radial symmetry. While our products are known for accuracy and durability, they are consumable in nature.
We offer an extensive line of workholding and toolholding solutions that are available in thousands of shapes and sizes to meet unique customer application needs. These solutions can be used on virtually all types and brands of metalcutting machines, as well as non-traditional uses in many industrial applications. The Company continues to explore opportunities to expand this business organically and through acquisitions.

Sales, Markets and Distribution
We sell our products in most of the industrialized countries of the world through a combination of direct sales, distributors, agents, and manufacturers' representatives. Generally, our distributors have an exclusive right to sell our products in a defined geographic area. Our distributors operate as independent businesses and purchase products from us at discounted prices for their customers, while agents and representatives sell products on our behalf and receive commissions on sales. Our discount schedule is adjusted to reflect the level of pre and post-sales support offered by our distributors. Our direct sales personnel earn a fixed salary plus commission. Sales through distributors are made only on standard commercial open account terms or through letters of credit. Distributors generally take title to products upon shipment from our facilities and do not have any special return privileges.
 Our standard ATA products are sold through direct sales, distribution, and via our web site at www.shophardinge.com. Custom or special solutions are sold through direct sales and agents. In most cases, we are able to package and ship in-stock tooling, accessories, and repair parts within 24 hours of receiving orders. We can package and ship items with heavy demand within a few hours. 
We promote our products through advertising in trade publications, web presences, email newsletters, and participation in industry trade shows. In addition, we market our non-machine products and capabilities through the publication of general catalogs and other targeted catalogs, which we distribute to existing and prospective customers. We have a presence on the internet at www.hardinge.com and www.forkardt.com, where customers can obtain information about our products and place orders for accessories, tooling, knee mill products, and repair parts.
A substantial portion of our end use customers are small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers. Industries directly and indirectly served by us include aerospace, automotive, computer, communications, consumer-electronics, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment, and transportation.
No single customer or related group of customers accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated sales in 2017 or 2016. While valuing our relationship with each customer, we do not believe that the loss of any single customer, or any few customers, would have an adverse material effect on our business. Order backlog was $130.6 million and $117.0 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Competitive Conditions
In our industry, the barriers to entry for competition vary based on the level of product performance required. For the products with the highest performance in terms of accuracy and productivity, the barriers are generally technical in nature. For basic products, the barriers are tied to product availability, competitive price position, and an effective distribution model that offers the pre and post-sales support required by customers. Another significant barrier in the global machine tool industry is the high level of working capital that is required to operate the business.
We compete in various sectors of the machine tool market within the products of turning, milling, grinding, tooling, and accessories. We compete with multiple companies in each market sector we serve. The primary competitive factors in the marketplace for our machine tools are technical performance, reliability, price, delivery time, and service. Our management considers our segment of the industry to be extremely competitive. There are many manufacturers of machine tools in the world. They can be categorized by the size of material their products can machine and the precision level their products can achieve. For our high precision, multi-tasking turning and milling equipment, competition comes primarily from companies such as DMG Mori Seiki, Mazak, and Okuma. Competition in our more standard turning and milling equipment comes, in part, from those companies as well as Doosan, which is based in South Korea, and Haas, which is based in the U.S., as well as many Taiwanese companies. Our internal and outer diameter cylindrical grinding machines compete primarily with products manufactured by United Grinding Group, a Swiss company, as well as Toyoda and Shigiya, which are based in Japan. Our Hauser jig grinding machines compete primarily with products manufactured by Moore Tool, which is based in the U.S., and some Japanese suppliers. Our surface grinding machines compete with products manufactured by Okamoto in Japan and Chevalier in Taiwan. Our ATA products compete with many products manufactured by a variety of small companies.
The overall number of our competitors providing product solutions serving our target markets may increase. Also, the overall composition of companies with which we compete may change as we broaden our product offerings and the geographic markets we serve. As we expand into new market areas, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but from other competitors as well, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those 
7

markets. In addition, several of our competitors may have greater resources, including financial, technical, and engineering resources, than we do.
Sources and Availability of Components
Our machines within the MMS segment are produced around the world. We produce certain of our lathes, knee mills, and related products at our Elmira, New York plant. The Kellenberger and Voumard grinding machines and related products are manufactured at our St. Gallen, Switzerland plant and Hauser and Tschudin products are produced at our Biel, Switzerland facility. The Jones & Shipman grinding machines are currently manufactured at our Leicester, England plant. The Usach grinding machines are manufactured at our Elgin, Illinois plant. We produce machining centers and lathes at our Hardinge Taiwan facility in Nan Tou, Taiwan and our Hardinge Precision Machinery (Jiaxing) Company, Ltd. facility in Jiaxing, China. The Company's Forkardt and Hardinge branded ATA segment products and solutions are engineered and produced in our plants located in Traverse City, Michigan, Elmira, New York, Reutlingen, Germany, Noisy le Sec, France, Hyderabad, India and Shanghai, China. We manufacture products from various raw materials, including cast iron, sheet metal, and bar steel. We purchase a number of components, sub-assemblies, and assemblies from outside suppliers, including the computer and electronic components for our computer controlled lathes, grinding machines, and machining centers. There are multiple suppliers for virtually all of our raw material, components, sub-assemblies, and assemblies and, historically, we have not experienced a serious supply interruption. However, in 2011, because of the increase in demand driven by early 2011 worldwide order activity, producers of bearings, ball screws, and linear guides had difficulty meeting the rise in demand. Similar demand increase in the future could impact our production schedules.
A major component of our computer controlled machines is the computer and related electronics package. We purchase these components from Fanuc Limited, a Japanese electronics company, Heidenhain, a German control supplier, Mitsubishi Electric, a Japanese electronics company, or from Siemens, another German control manufacturer. While we believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing from several other existing suppliers, and we occasionally do so for special orders, a disruption in the supply of the computer controls from one of our suppliers could cause us to experience a substantial disruption of our operations, depending on the circumstances at the time. We purchase parts from these suppliers under normal trade terms. There are no agreements with these suppliers to purchase minimum volumes per year.
Research and Development
Our ongoing research and development program involves creating new products, modifying existing products to meet specific customer needs, and redesigning existing products, both to add new functionality and to reduce the cost of manufacturing. Our research and development departments throughout the world are staffed with experienced design engineers with varying levels of education, ranging from technical training to doctoral degrees.
The worldwide cost of research and development, all of which has been charged to operating expense, amounted to $14.5 million, $13.5 million and $14.1 million, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Patents
Although we hold several patents with respect to certain of our products, we do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent upon any single patent or group of patents.
Seasonal Trends and Working Capital Requirements
Hardinge's business and that of the machine tool industry in general, is cyclical. It is not subject to significant seasonal trends. However, our quarterly results are subject to fluctuation based on the timing of our shipments of machines, which are largely dependent upon customer delivery requirements. Given that a large percentage of our sales are from Asia, the impact of plant shutdowns in that region by us and our customers due to the celebration of the Lunar New Year holiday may impact the first quarter sales, income from operations, and net income, and result in the first quarter being the lowest quarter of the year.
The ability to deliver products within a short period of time is an important competitive criterion. We must have inventory on hand to meet customers' delivery expectations, which for standard machines typically range from immediate to eight weeks delivery. Meeting this requirement is especially difficult with some of our products, where delivery is extended due to time associated with shipping on ocean-going vessels, depending on the location of the customer. This creates a need to have inventory of finished machines available in our major markets to serve our customers in a timely manner.
8

We deliver many of our machine products within one to two months after the order. Some orders, especially multiple machine orders, are delivered on a turnkey basis with the machine or group of machines configured to make certain parts for the customer. This type of order often includes the addition of material handling equipment, tooling, and specific programming. In those cases, the customer usually observes and inspects the parts being made on the machine at our facility before shipment so the timing of the sale is dependent upon the customer's schedule and acceptance. Lead times for these types of orders, especially grinding machines, can range from six to eight months. Therefore, sales from quarter-to-quarter can vary depending upon the timing of customers' acceptances and the significance of those orders.
We feel it is important, where practical, to provide readily available accessories and replacement parts for the machines we sell and we carry inventory at levels sufficient to meet these customer requirements.
Governmental Regulations
We believe that our current operations and our current uses of property, plant and equipment conform in all material respects to applicable laws and regulations in the various countries in which we conduct business.
Governmental Contracts
No material portion of our business is subject to government contracts.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters. Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal. Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.
The Elmira, NY manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) because of groundwater contamination. The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the “Site”) encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, NY. In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (“RI/FS”) for the Koppers Pond (the “Pond”) portion of the Site. The EPA documented the release and threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment at the Site, including releases into and in the vicinity of the Pond. The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
Until receipt of this Special Notice in February 2006, the Company had never been named as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at the Site nor had the Company received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the Site. Environmental sampling on the Company’s property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond, and found no evidence that the Company’s operations or property have contributed or are contributing to the contamination. 
A substantial portion of the Pond is located on the Company’s property. The Company, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation and Toshiba America, Inc., (collectively, the "PRP's"), agreed to voluntarily participate in the RI/FS by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006. On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the EPA, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA. The PRP's also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the costs associated with the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
The EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan in May of 2008. In July of 2012, the PRP's submitted a Remedial Investigation ("RI") to respond to EPA issues raised in the initial draft RI. In January 2016, the PRP's submitted a draft Feasibility Study ("FS"), also to respond to issues raised by the EPA about previous drafts of the FS. In July 2016, the EPA announced its proposed remediation plan based on an alternative put forth in a July 2016 Woodruff & Curran FS with an estimated total clean-up phase cost of $1.9 million. The preferred remedy consists of the placement of a continuous six-inch thick soil and sand cap, including a geotextile membrane to act as a demarcation layer, over the Pond. The preferred remedy includes long-term monitoring and institutional controls. After a public comment period, on December 13, 2016, the EPA issued a Certificate of Completion confirming that the RI/FS was complete, confirming that all PRP obligations related to the 
9

RI/FS had been performed in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent, and approving the remedy selected in the FS as the final response action for the Pond.
In June 2017, the EPA issued a Special Notice letter to the original PRP’s and two new additional parties (Eaton Corporation and Elmira Water Board) requesting these PRPs to fund, undertake, and complete the remedy for the Pond. Shortly after, the EPA provided a proposed Statement of Work for completion of the remedy (“SOW”) and the EPA agreed to waive the past response costs as defined in the RI/FS Order of Consent in full if the parties could reach a settlement with the EPA by September 30, 2017.
 In September 2017, the nine participating PRPs privately negotiated and finalized an allocation of costs amongst themselves, with 10.75% of the costs being allocated to the Company. Based on the estimated cost of the present remedy of $1.9 million, and with credit for costs previously paid by the Company for the RI/FS, the remaining costs that have been allocated to the Company will not exceed $0.2 million. The Company has the entire amount reserved as of December 31, 2017. This reserve is reported in Accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Based upon information currently available, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, the Company does not have material liabilities for environmental remediation. Though the foregoing reflects the Company’s current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, Hardinge Inc. employed 1,384 persons, 440 of whom were located in the United States. Management believes that relations with our employees are good.
Foreign Operations and Export Sales
Information related to foreign and domestic operations and sales is included in Note 17. "Segment Information" to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report. Our strategy has been to diversify our sales and operations geographically so that the impact of economic trends in different regions can be balanced.
The risks associated with conducting business on an international basis are discussed further in Item 1A. "Risk Factors".
