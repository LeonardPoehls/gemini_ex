ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company History and Overview
 
History of Southeastern Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
 
Safe Lane Systems, Inc. (“Safe Lane Systems”, “Safe Lane Systems,” “We,” “Us,” “Our,” or “Company” hereafter), was incorporated in the State of Colorado on September 10, 2013. We were originally formed to engage in the sale of traffic safety equipment. We may also engage in any other business permitted by law, as designated by the Board of Directors of our Company.
 
The Company redomiciled to become a Delaware Holding Corporation in September of 2016.
 
On September 22, 2016, the Company formed two wholly owned subsidiaries, SLS Industrial, Inc. and Southeastern Holdings, Inc. (both Delaware corporations).
 
On September 30, 2016, the Company merged with SLS Industrial, Inc., which became the surviving entity. SLS Industrial, Inc. and Southeastern Holdings, Inc. then restructured to a Delaware holdings structure, in which SLS Industrial, Inc., became a wholly owned subsidiary of Southeastern Holdings, Inc. The Companies restructured under a plan of merger and reorganization, in which the then-outstanding 25,118,273 shares of common stock, 10,000,000 shares of Class A Preferred Stock and 0 shares of Class B Preferred Stock would ultimately translate 1 for 1 to the same interests in Southeastern Holdings, Inc.
 
On December 1, 2016, the Company spun off its wholly owned subsidiary, SLS Industrial, Inc., leaving Southeastern Holdings as the only surviving entity. Immediately prior to the date of the spin-off, the subsidiary held fully impaired intellectual property and owed net liabilities of $527,270, comprised of $415,000 of convertible debt, $30,178 of accrued unpaid interest on that debt and $82,092 of accounts payable pertaining to professional fees. The Company effected the spinoff by transferring its entire equity interest in SLS Industrial, Inc. in exchange for assuming $40,000 of the outstanding accounts payable and issuing payment of $1,000 cash to the buyer. As a result, the Company recognized a debt extinguishment gain of $486,270 in 2016.
 
The Company is currently evaluating new business opportunities. Though the company has not identified which opportunity it will pursue it is expected that it will by December 31, 2018.
 
Our Auditors have issued a going concern opinion and the reasons noted for issuing the opinion are our lack of revenues, insignificant cash compared to current liabilities and a lack of available capital. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. However, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to do so. New business opportunities may never emerge, and we may not be able to sufficiently fund the pursuit of new business opportunities should they arise.

As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $733 in cash on hand. Our current monthly cash burn rate is approximately $500, and it is expected that burn rate will continue until significant additional capital is raised and our marketing plan is executed. While there is currently very modest cash burn, our trade creditors may call debts at any time, and our cash reserves would not be sufficient to satisfy all balances. We are currently dependent on minimal expenses to be covered by a loan or other cash infusion from the company’s chairman of the board and CEO, Mr. Dickman. There is no guarantee that this cash infusion will continue to be made.
 
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

• | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&A;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this prospectus, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)2(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period provided above and therefore our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
 
We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
 
For more details regarding this exemption, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies.”
 
COMPANY BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
Our Company, originally Safe Lane Systems, Inc., was formed to develop the marketing and contract the manufacturing of certain products resulting from development of IP in design and manufacturing by Superior Traffic Controls, Inc. We licensed certain IP under a Master License and a Sub License to capitalize the marketing and contract manufacturing of certain products.
 
After spinning off the assets and liabilities of our traffic safety division in December 2016, we no longer possess the aforementioned intellectual property or rights thereto and are currently pursuing new business opportunities.
 
Our Proposed Products:
 
We are currently pursuing new product and business opportunities.

Sales and Marketing Plan
 
Once the company settles on a new business plan it will adopt an appropriate sales and marketing plan to support those efforts.
 
Milestones Reached To Date
 
In connection with our spinoff of primary operations, we are pursuing new business opportunities and will be developing milestones around those. Over the next year, we hope to find new business opportunities and generate additional capital to allow us to fund and develop new products and marketing.
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had a cash balance of $733. While, we currently have a $500 monthly cash burn rate, we do not have sufficient cash to pay vendor balances if called or to fund a new business plan. The current burn is being financed by advances from the companies Chairman of the board but there is no guarantee that these funds will be available in the future.
 
COMPETITION, MARKETS, AND REGULATION
 
Competition
 
With our current focus on pursuing new business opportunities, we are currently unable to concretely identify competition. However, we do expect fierce competition from established players and other up-and-coming players in our future industry.

Backlog of Orders.
 
We currently have no orders for sales at this time.

We have no government contracts.
 
Company Sponsored Research and Development.
 
We are not conducting any research, although our products and future products may be in development.
 
Number of Persons Employed.
 
As of January 31, 2018, we have no employees and 1 independent consultant. Our officers are spending part-time in this business – up to 10 hours per week.
 
PLAN OF OPERATIONS
 
Our Budget for operations in next fiscal year, 2018, is as follows:
 
APPLICATION OF FUNDS (1)
 

Professional fees | $ | 20,000
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---+-------
Total | $ | 20,000
(1) These items are variable and no commitment has been obtained from any source. | |

-

 

We may change any or all of the budget categories in the execution of its business model. None of the line items are to be considered fixed or unchangeable. We may need substantial additional capital to support our budget. We have recognized no revenues from our existing operational activities.
 
We may need to raise additional funds to support not only our expected budget, but also our continued operations. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to raise such funds or whether we would be able to raise such funds with terms that are favorable to us. We may seek to borrow monies from lenders at commercial rates, but such lenders will likely either deny us credit or lend at higher than bank rates, which higher rates could, depending on the amount borrowed, make the net operating income insufficient to cover the interest.
 
If we are unable to begin to generate enough revenue to cover our operational costs, we will need to seek additional sources of funds. Currently, we have no committed source for any funds as of date hereof. No representation is made that any funds will be available when needed. In the event funds cannot be raised if and when needed, we may not be able to carry out our business plan and could fail in business as a result of these uncertainties.
 
We intend to conduct research and development, market research, product formulation, and will continue to seek new business opportunities.

SAFE LANES SYSTEMS, INC.
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 September 30, 2016
 

NOTE 1.  ORGANIZATION, OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
 
SAFE LANES SYSTEMS, INC. (the “Company”), was incorporated in the State of Colorado on September 10, 2013. The Company was formed to engage in the sale of traffic safety equipment. The Company may also engage in any other business permitted by law, as designated by the Board of Directors of the Company. During the second quarter of 2014 the Company secured a perpetual license to all of the intellectual property of Superior Traffic Control in exchange for the issuance of nonvoting convertible stock in the company. In the second quarter of 2016 the Company determined that license and related intellectual property should be written off as worthless due to problems with the engineering provided and the inability to obtain meaningful sales. The Company was redomiciled to become a Delaware Holding Corporation in September of 2016 and is currently pursuing new business opportunities.
 
Basis of Presentation - The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the information contained herein reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature.
 
Reclassifications - Certain amounts in the prior period’s financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current quarter’s presentation and to correct prior period errors.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
Cash Flows - During the period ending September 30, 2016, the Company primarily utilized cash proceeds from an unsecured short term loan and proceeds from a convertible note payable to fund its operations.
 
Cash flows used by operations for the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $34,911 and $186,689 respectively.
 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $7,871 as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $15,282 as of December 31, 2015.
 
Impairment of Long-life Assets
 
In accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable. If the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the asset. No impairment was deemed necessary as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Intangible Assets, Patents
 
During the second quarter of 2014 fiscal year the Company acquired the exclusive license rights and intellectual property for the patent of the Kone General device which expires July 2022. As payment for the license rights the company agreed to issue 22,768,273 shares of class B preferred, nonvoting shares to the shareholders of the original license holders “Superior Traffic Controls”. The Company accounts for its patent sub-license in accordance with ASC 350-30-30 “Intangibles – goodwill and other” and 805-50-30 and 805-50-15 related to “Business Combinations” by recognizing the fair value to the amount paid by the company for the asset at the time of purchase. Since Safe Lanes Systems has a limited operating history management determined to use par value as the value recognized for the transaction. Since the patent has a predetermined, finite life span, the cost of the asset will be recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining life of the patent.
 
At the conclusion of each reporting period the patent is evaluated for impairment. As of September 30, 2016 due to the lack of sales and determining that incomplete engineering plans were provided the Company determined it should impair the entire remaining value of the intangible asset and at that time the remaining value was of $1,562 was written off to impairment expense.

Unsecured, short-term notes payable
 
The company obtained an unsecured, short-term note of $250,000 at 4% from the original holder of the license to the Kone-General patent in the second quarter of 2014. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had received funding of $250,000 on the note payable and an additional $165,000 under the same terms with a verbal agreement in place and had recognized $27,404 in accrued interest expense.
 
Convertible, long-term notes payable
 
The company obtained five unsecured, long-term notes totaling $7,500 in the third quarter of 2016. The notes do not bear interest until December 31, 2016, after which they will bear interest at 12% per year. The notes are due and payable December 31, 2017 but can be converted into the company’s common stock at the holders request at any time before they are due. Each note will convert into approximately 4% of the companies then outstanding common stock.
 
Stockholders’ Equity
 
At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share. In addition, 10,000,000 shares of Class A preferred super majority voting stock, $.0001 par value and 50,000,000 shares of Class B preferred, $.0001 par value nonvoting convertible shares were authorized. All common stock shares have full dividend rights. However, it is not anticipated that the Company will be declaring distributions in the foreseeable future.
 
Upon formation, the Company sold the founder 2,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value common stock for $1,000 cash. Also upon formation, the Company paid the founder stock based compensation for services rendered of 10,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value class A preferred super majority voting stock. These preferred shares have a stated value of par value of $0.0001. The holder of the Class Stock shall have the right to vote on any matter with holders of Common Stock and may vote as required on any action, which Colorado law provides may or must be approved by vote or consent of the holders of the specific series of voting preferred shares and the holders of common shares. The Record Holders of the Class B Preferred Shares shall have that number of votes equal to that number of common shares which is not less than 60% of the vote required to approve any action, which Colorado law provides may or must be approved by vote or consent of the holders of other series of voting preferred shares and the holders of common shares or the holders of other securities entitled to vote, if any
 
Upon execution of a patent sublicense agreement the Company issued 22,768,273 shares of its class B preferred convertible stock to a trustee on behalf of shareholders of the original license agreement. These shares were converted into regular common stock upon the company registering the underlying shares with the SEC and distribution to stockholders which occurred in the 2015 fiscal year.
 
In the last quarter of 2015 the Company issued 350,000 shares of stock to two contractors for past work. As the Company has issued no stock for cash the Company valued the compensation based upon par value of $.0001 per share resulting in a compensation expense of $35 per share in the period the stock was issued.

Professional and contractor expenses
 
Professional and contractor expenses are comprised of the following in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016:
 

 | September 30, 2016 | | September 30, 2015 | 
----------------------------+---------------------+--------+---------------------+--
Contract Management Fees | $ | 48,600 | | $ | 48,600 
Other Professional Services | | 35,110 | | | 123,886
 | $ | 83,710 | | $ | 172,486

Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Stock Based Compensation
 
The Company accounts for share-based payments pursuant to ASC 718, “Stock Compensation” and, accordingly, the Company records compensation expense for share-based awards based upon an assessment of the grant date fair value for stock options and restricted stock awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
 
Stock compensation expense for stock options is recognized over the vesting period of the award or expensed immediately under ASC 718 and EITF 96-18 when options are given for previous service without further recourse. The Company issued stock options to contractors that had been providing services to the Company upon their termination of services. Under ASC 718 and EITF 96-18 these options were recognized as expense in the period issued because they were given as a form of compensation for services already rendered with no recourse.
 
The following table summarizes  share-based compensation expense recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses during each period presented:
 

 | September 30, 2016 | | December 31, 2015 | 
---------------------------------------+---------------------+---+--------------------+--
Stock award | | – | | | 350,000
Total Share-Based Compensation Expense | $ | – | | $ | 35 

 
In the last quarter of 2015 the Company issued 350,000 shares of stock to two contractors for past work. As the Company has issued no stock for cash the Company valued the compensation based upon par value of $.001 per share resulting in a compensation expense of $35 per share in the period the stock was issued.
 
Stock option activity was as follows:
 

 | Number of Shares | | Weighted Average Exercise Price ($)
------------------------------+-------------------+------------+------------------------------------
Balance at December 31, 2014 | | 10,000,000 | | 0.20

The following table presents information regarding options outstanding and exercisable as of September 30, 2016:
 

Weighted average contractual remaining term - options outstanding | | 0.0 years 
------------------------------------------------------------------+---+-----------
Aggregate intrinsic value - options outstanding | | – 
Warrants exercisable | | 10,000,000
Weighted average exercise price - options exercisable | $ | 0.20 

 
The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions for grants as follows:
 

Risk-free interest rate | 0.01% 
-------------------------+----------
Expected life of options | 4-5 years
Annualized volatility | 144.00% 
Dividend Income | 0.00% 

Income Tax
 
The Company accounts for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (“SFAS 109”).  Under SFAS 109 deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.  Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
 
Fiscal year
 
The Company employs a fiscal year ending December 31.
 
Net Income (Loss) per share
 
The net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common outstanding. Warrants, stock options, and common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Company’s preferred stock (if any), are not included in the computation if the effect would be anti-dilutive and would increase the earnings or decrease loss per share.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The Company is currently in the Development stage and has very limited revenues. Revenue will be recognized on an accrual basis as earned once operations commence.
Financial Instruments
 
The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, as reported in the accompanying balance sheet, are stated at fair value.
 
Going Concern and Managements’ Plans
 
As shown in the accompanying financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company has a limited operating history.
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, however, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to do so.  The financial statements do not include any adjustment to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
The Company has a plan in place to remove this threat through the issuance of notes payable and common stocks offerings. If the Offering raises at least $250,000, then the Company’s estimated expenses related to the Offering and the expenses related to initial projected operating costs of the Company will be covered. However, the Company will need to generate more than the expenses of the Offering in order to have enough capital to execute its business plan.
