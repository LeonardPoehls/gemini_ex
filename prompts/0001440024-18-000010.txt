ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
We are a leading asset-right transportation and asset-light logistics service provider offering a full suite of solutions. Our Truckload Logistics (“TL”) and Less-than-Truckload (“LTL”) segments offer solutions including less-than-truckload, air and ground domestic and cross-border expedite, dry van and temperature controlled truckload logistics, and intermodal services. Our Global Solutions segment offers domestic freight management, retail consolidation, international freight forwarding, and customs brokerage. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, we re-branded Global Solutions as Ascent Global Logistics. 
We have three segments:
Truckload Logistics. Within our TL business, we arrange the pickup and delivery of truckload, intermodal, and ground and air expedited freight through our 42 TL service centers, 40 company brokers, and over 90 independent brokerage agents located throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. We offer temperature-controlled, dry van, intermodal drayage, and flatbed services and specialize in the transport of automotive parts, refrigerated foods, poultry, and beverages. Our on-demand ground and air expedited services feature proprietary bid technology supported by our fleets of ground and air assets. We believe this array of services and specialization provides our customers with full-service options and provides us with more consistent shipping volume in any given year.
Less-than-Truckload. Our LTL business involves the pickup, consolidation, linehaul, deconsolidation, and delivery of LTL shipments throughout the United States and parts of Canada. With 44 LTL service centers and over 150 third-party delivery agents, we are designed to provide customers with high reliability at an economical cost. We employ a point-to-point LTL model that we believe serves as a competitive advantage over the traditional hub and spoke LTL. 
Global Solutions. Within our Global Solutions business, we offer a full portfolio of domestic and international transportation and logistics solution, including access to cost-effective and time-sensitive modes of transportation within our broad network. Specifically, our Global Solutions offering includes pricing, contract management, transportation mode and carrier selection, freight tracking, freight bill payment and audit, cost reporting and analysis, dispatch, and freight consolidation and warehousing. Our customized Global Solutions offering is designed to allow our customers to reduce operating costs, redirect resources to core competencies, improve supply chain efficiency, and enhance customer service. Our Global Solutions business also includes domestic and international air and ocean transportation services and customs brokerage. 
Our Industry
Over-the-Road Freight
The over-the-road freight sector includes both private fleets (company drivers) and “for-hire” carriers (independent contractors (“ICs”) and purchased power providers). According to the American Trucking Associations (“ATA”), the U.S. freight sector represented revenue of approximately $906.0 billion in 2016 and accounted for approximately 80% of domestic freight transportation spend. The ATA estimates that U.S. freight transportation will increase to over $1.6 trillion by 2027. Private fleets consist of tractors and trailers owned and operated by shippers that move their own goods and, according to the ATA, accounted for revenue of approximately $308.2 billion in 2015. For-hire carriers transport TL and LTL freight belonging to others and, according to the ATA, accounted for revenue of approximately $368.0 billion in 2016.
TL carriers dedicate an entire trailer to one shipper from origin to destination and are categorized by the type of equipment they use to haul a shipper’s freight, such as temperature-controlled, dry van, tank, or flatbed trailers. According to the ATA, excluding private fleets, revenue in the U.S. TL segment was approximately $313.3 billion in 2016.
LTL carriers specialize in consolidating shipments from multiple shippers into truckload quantities for delivery to multiple destinations. LTL carriers are traditionally divided into two categories — national and regional. National carriers typically focus on two-day or longer service across distances greater than 1,000 miles and often operate without time-definite delivery, while regional carriers typically offer time-definite delivery in less than two days. According to the ATA, the U.S. LTL market generated revenue of approximately $54.7 billion in 2016.

Third-Party Logistics
Third-party logistics (“3PL”) providers offer transportation management solutions and distribution services, including the movement and storage of freight and the assembly of inventory. The U.S. 3PL sector revenue increased from approximately $89.4 billion in 2004 to approximately $166.8 billion in 2016 (and experienced growth each year during such period other than from 2008 to 2009), according to Armstrong & Associates, Inc., a leading supply chain market research firm. In addition, only 11.0% of logistics expenditures by U.S. businesses were outsourced in 2016, according to Armstrong & Associates. We believe that the market penetration of 3PL providers will expand in the future as companies increasingly redirect their resources to core competencies and outsource their transportation and logistics requirements as they realize the cost-effectiveness of 3PL providers.
Factors Important to Our Business
Our success principally depends on our ability to generate revenues through our network of sales personnel, proprietary bid technology, and independent brokerage agents and to deliver freight in all modes safely, on time, and cost-effectively through a suite of solutions tailored to the needs of each customer. Customer shipping demand, over-the-road freight tonnage levels, events leading to expedited shipping requirements, and equipment capacity ultimately drive increases or decreases in our revenues. Our ability to operate profitably and generate cash is also impacted by purchased transportation costs, personnel and related benefits costs, fuel costs, pricing dynamics, customer mix, and our ability to manage costs effectively.
Agent Network and Sales Personnel.  In our TL business, we arrange the pickup and delivery of freight either through our growing sales force of company brokers and salespeople or through our network of over 90 independent brokerage agents. Brokerage agents complement our company sales force by bringing pre-existing customer relationships, new customer prospects, and/or access to new geographic markets. Furthermore, brokerage agents typically provide immediate revenue and do not require us to invest in incremental overhead. Brokerage agents own or lease their own office space and pay for other costs associated with running their operations. 
In our LTL business, while many national asset-based LTL providers are encumbered by the fixed overhead costs associated with owning or leasing most or all of their de-consolidation and delivery facilities, we maintain our variable cost structure through the extensive use of delivery agents. We have a network of over 150 third-party LTL delivery agents that provide cost-effective delivery coverage throughout North America. In addition to our agent network, we market and sell our LTL services through a sales force of over 80 people, consisting of account executives, sales managers, inside sales representatives, and commissioned sales representatives. 
In our Global Solutions business, we have over 60 salespeople and commissioned sales representatives. 
Tonnage Levels and Capacity. Competition intensifies in the transportation industry as tonnage levels decrease and equipment capacity increases. Our ability to maintain or grow existing tonnage levels is impacted by overall economic conditions, shipping demand, over-the-road freight capacity in North America, and capacity in domestic air freight, as well as by our ability to compete effectively in terms of pricing, safety, and on-time delivery. We do business with a broad base of third-party carriers, including ICs and purchased power providers, together with a blend of our own ground and air capacity, which reduces the impact of tightening capacity on our business.
Purchased Transportation Costs.  Purchased transportation costs within our TL business are generally based either on negotiated rates for each load hauled or spot market rates for ground and air services. Purchased transportation costs within our LTL business represent amounts we pay to ICs or purchased power providers and are generally contractually agreed-upon rates. Within our Global Solutions business, purchased transportation costs represent payments made to our purchased power providers, which are generally contractually agreed-upon rates. Purchased transportation costs are the largest component of our cost structure. Our purchased transportation costs typically increase or decrease in proportion to revenues.
Personnel and Related Benefits. Personnel and related benefits costs are a large component of our overall cost structure. We employ over 1,500 company drivers who are paid either per mile or at an hourly rate. In addition, we employ over 600 dock workers and over 2,200 operations and other administrative personnel to support our day-to-day operations. Personnel and related benefits costs could vary significantly as we may be required to adjust staffing levels to match our business needs. 
Fuel. The transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies and the price of fuel. Fuel prices have fluctuated dramatically over recent years. Within our TL and Global Solutions businesses, we generally pass fuel costs through to our customers. As a result, our operating income in these businesses is less impacted by rises in fuel prices. Within our LTL business, our ICs and purchased power providers pass along the cost of diesel fuel to us, and we in turn attempt to pass along some or all of these costs to our customers through fuel surcharge revenue programs. Although revenues from fuel surcharges generally offset increases in fuel costs, other operating costs have been, and may continue to be, impacted by fluctuating fuel prices. The total impact of higher energy prices on other nonfuel-related expenses is difficult to ascertain. We cannot predict future fuel price fluctuations, the impact of higher energy prices on other cost elements, recoverability of higher fuel costs through fuel surcharges, 
2

and the effect of fuel surcharges on our overall rate structure or the total price that we will receive from our customers. Depending on the changes in the fuel rates and the impact on costs in other fuel- and energy-related areas, our operating margins could be impacted. 
Pricing. The pricing environment in the transportation industry also impacts our operating performance. Within our TL business, we typically charge a flat rate negotiated on each load hauled. Pricing within our TL business is typically driven by shipment frequency and consistency, length of haul, and customer and geographic mix, but generally has fewer influential factors than pricing within our LTL business. Within our LTL business, we typically generate revenues by charging our customers a rate based on shipment weight, distance hauled, and commodity type. This amount is comprised of a base rate, a fuel surcharge, and any applicable service fees. Our LTL pricing is dictated primarily by factors such as shipment size, shipment frequency and consistency, length of haul, freight density, and customer and geographic mix. Within our Global Solutions business, we typically charge a variable rate on each shipment in addition to transaction or service fees appropriate for the solution we have provided to meet a specific customer’s needs. Since we offer both TL and LTL shipping as part of our Global Solutions offering, pricing within our Global Solutions business is impacted by similar factors. The pricing environment for all of our operations generally becomes more competitive during periods of lower industry tonnage levels and/or increased capacity within the over-the-road freight sector. In addition, when we provide international freight forwarding services in our Global Solutions business, we also contract with airlines, ocean carriers, and agents as needed. The international shipping markets are very dynamic and we must therefore adjust rates regularly based on market conditions. 
Our Strategy
Our goal is to be the leading asset-right transportation and asset-light logistics service provider in North America. Our strategy includes continuing to:
Generate Free Cash Flows. Our scalable business model and low capital expenditures (as a percentage of our revenues) enhance our ability to generate strong free cash flows and returns on our invested capital and assets. 
Gain New Customers. We continue to expand our customer base, and we will continue to pursue increased market share in the TL, LTL, and Global Solutions markets. Our expansive geographic reach and broad service offering provides us with the ability to add new customers seeking transportation and logistics solutions. We also believe the pool of potential new customers will grow as the benefits of third-party transportation management solutions continue to be embraced.
Increase Penetration with Existing Customers. With our comprehensive service offering and large global network, we have substantial cross-selling opportunities and the potential to capture a greater share of existing customer’s annual transportation and logistics expenditures. 
Increased Levels of Integration. We adopted a long-term brand and go-to-market service offering plan in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Over the next three years, in order to implement this plan we expect to increase the level of integration within each of our three segments in order to improve our ability to serve customers.  For example, in November of 2016, we re-branded our Roadrunner LTL business as Roadrunner Freight and in January of 2017, we re-branded our Global Solutions business as Ascent Global Logistics.  These are first steps in the implementation of our long-term brand and go-to-market service offering plan.
Our Services
We are a leading asset-right transportation and asset-light logistics service provider offering a full suite of solutions. In each of our service offerings, we utilize a blend of company-owned and third-party owned equipment to provide the most cost effective service for our customers. Because of this blend, we are able to focus primarily on providing quality service rather than on asset utilization. Our customers generally communicate their freight needs to one of our transportation specialists on a shipment-by-shipment basis via telephone, fax, Internet, e-mail, or electronic data interchange (“EDI”). We leverage a diverse group of third-party carriers and ICs to provide scalable capacity and reliable service to our extensive customer base in North America.
3

Truckload Logistics
We are a leading TL business operation in North America in terms of revenue. We provide a comprehensive range of TL solutions for our customers by leveraging our broad base of third-party carriers who operate temperature-controlled, dry van, and/or flatbed capacity. Although we specialize in the transport of refrigerated foods, poultry, and beverages, we also provide a variety of TL transportation solutions for dry goods ranging from paper products to steel, as well as flatbed service for larger industrial load requirements. Our intermodal capabilities include drayage, which is the transport of freight between ocean ports or rail ramps and shipping docks. We also have a strong presence in TL expedited services for our customers with just-in-time and time critical transportation needs. Expedited offerings include ground and air cargo services. We arrange the pickup and delivery of TL freight through our 42 TL service centers, 40 company brokers, and over 90 independent brokerage agents located throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. 
Company Brokers and Salespeople. We have 40 company brokers that not only engage in the routing and selection of our transportation providers, but also supplement our internal TL sales force. Internal sales personnel and company brokers are responsible for managing existing customer relationships and generating new customer relationships. Because the performance of these individuals is essential to our success, we offer attractive incentive-based compensation packages that we believe keep our brokers and sales force motivated, focused, and service-oriented.
Independent Brokerage Agents. We also maintain a network of independent brokerage agents that complement our network of company brokers by bringing pre-existing customer relationships, new customer prospects, and/or access to new geographic markets. Furthermore, they typically provide immediate revenue and do not require us to invest in incremental overhead. Brokerage agents own or lease their own office space and pay for their own communications equipment, insurance, and any other costs associated with running their operation. We only invest in the working capital required to execute our quick pay strategy and generally pay a commission to our brokerage agents ranging from 40-70% of the margin we earn on a TL shipment. Similar to company brokers, our brokerage agents engage in the routing and selection of transportation providers for our customer base and perform sales and customer service functions on our behalf.
Brokerage Agent Expansion. We believe we offer brokerage agents a very attractive partnership opportunity. We offer access to our reliable network of purchased power providers and we invest in the working capital required to pay these carriers promptly and assume collection responsibility. We believe this has contributed to our reputation for quality and reliable service, as well as to the consistent growth of our brokerage agent network. As of December 31, 2016, our TL brokerage agent network consisted of over 90 agents. Additionally, 31 of our brokerage agents generated more than $1 million in revenue in 2016. We believe our increased development efforts and attractive value proposition will allow us to further expand our brokerage agent network and enhance the growth of our TL business.
Less-than-Truckload
Based on our industry knowledge, we believe we are the largest asset-light provider of LTL transportation services in North America in terms of revenue. We provide LTL service originating from points within approximately 150 miles of our service centers to most destinations throughout the United States and parts of Canada. Within the United States, we offer national, long-haul service (1,000 miles or greater), inter-regional service (between 500 and 1,000 miles), and regional service (500 miles or less). We serve a diverse group of customers within a variety of industries, including retail, industrial, paper goods, manufacturing, food and beverage, health care, chemicals, computer hardware, and general commodities.
We use over 150 third-party LTL delivery agents to complement our service center footprint and to provide cost-effective full state, national, and North American delivery coverage. Delivery agents also enhance our ability to handle special needs of the final consignee, such as scheduled deliveries and specialized delivery equipment.
We utilize a point-to-point LTL model that is differentiated from the traditional, asset-based hub and spoke LTL model. Our model does not require intermediate handling at a break-bulk hub (a large terminal where freight is offloaded, sorted, and reloaded), which we believe represents a competitive advantage. 
Key aspects of our LTL service offering include the following:

• | Pickup. In order to stay as close as possible to our customers, we prefer to directly pick up freight whenever cost-effective. We generally directly pick up freight within 150 miles of one of our service centers, primarily utilizing local ICs. Although we generally do not own the tractors or other powered transportation equipment used to transport our customers’ freight, we own or lease trailers for use in local city pickup and delivery. In 2016, we picked up approximately 79% of our customers’ LTL shipments. The remainder was handled by agents with whom we generally have long-standing relationships. 

4


• | Consolidation at Service Centers. Key to our model are our 44 LTL service centers that we lease in strategic markets throughout the United States. At these service centers, numerous smaller LTL shipments are unloaded, consolidated into truckload shipments, and loaded onto a linehaul unit scheduled for a destination city. In order to continuously emphasize optimal load building and enhance operating margins, dock managers review every load before it is dispatched from one of our service centers.


• | Linehaul. Linehaul is the longest leg of the LTL shipment process. In dispatching a load, a linehaul coordinator uses our technology system to optimize cost-efficiency and service by assigning the load to the appropriate IC, company driver, or purchased power. In 2016, approximately 58% of our linehaul shipments were handled by over 500 LTL ICs with the remainder shipped via company driver, purchased power, or rail.


• | De-consolidation and Delivery. Within our unique model, linehaul shipments are transported to our service centers, delivery agents, or direct to end users without stopping at a break-bulk hub, as is often necessary under the traditional, asset-based hub and spoke LTL model. This generally reduces physical handling and damage claims. In 2016, we delivered approximately 31% of LTL shipments through our service centers and 69% through our delivery agents. 


• | Benefits of a Delivery Agent Network. While many national asset-based LTL providers are encumbered by the fixed overhead associated with owning or leasing most or all of their de-consolidation and delivery facilities, we maintain our variable cost structure through the extensive use of delivery agents.

Global Solutions 
Our Global Solutions offering is designed to provide comprehensive or à la carte 3PL services, domestic and international transportation, and freight consolidation and warehousing. We provide the necessary operational expertise, information technology capabilities, and relationships with third-party transportation providers to meet the unique needs of our customers. For customers that require the most comprehensive service plans, we complement their internal logistics and transportation management personnel and operations, enabling them to redirect resources to core competencies, reduce internal transportation management personnel costs, and, in many cases, achieve substantial annual freight savings. Key aspects of our Global Solutions capabilities include the following:

• | Procurement. After an in-depth consultation and analysis with our customer to identify cost savings opportunities, we develop an estimate of our customer’s potential savings and design a plan for implementation. If necessary, we manage a targeted bid process based on the customer’s traffic lanes, shipment volumes, and product characteristics, and negotiate rates with reputable carriers. In addition to a cost-efficient rate, the customer receives a summary of projected savings as well as our carrier recommendation.


• | Shipment Planning. Utilizing our technology systems and an expansive multi-modal network of third-party transportation providers, we determine the appropriate mode of transportation and select the ideal provider. In addition, we provide load optimization services based on freight patterns and consolidation opportunities. We also provide rating and routing services, either on-site with one of our transportation specialists, off-site through our centralized call center, or online through our website. Finally, we offer merge-in-transit coordination to synchronize the arrival and pre-consolidation of high-value components integral to a customer’s production process, enabling them to achieve reduced cycle times, lower inventory holding costs, and improved supply chain visibility.


• | Customs Brokerage Services. We provide customs brokerage services to customers importing goods. We remove the burden on completing potentially complex customs documentation and paperwork and charge our customers a small fee for completing such work. In addition to processing documents for clearance, our knowledgeable staff can assist with customs compliance issues and remote location filing, and provide information on C-TPAT certification. 


• | International Freight Forwarding. We provide comprehensive air and ocean freight forwarding solutions. For customers requiring ocean freight solutions, we provide full-container-load, less-than-container-load, charters, bulk, refrigerated service or other unique solutions based on our customers' requirements. For customers requiring air freight solutions, we provide express service, temperature control, monitored door-to-door service, consolidated services or aircraft charters, and onboard couriers. We are well-versed in the many technical aspects of government regulations, state and commerce department licensing requirements, foreign government forms, transportation documents, and international collection and banking procedures. We are an authorized International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) agent and also an Indirect Air Carrier authorized by the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”). Some of our locations are also authorized cargo screening locations. 


• | Shipment Execution. Our transportation specialists are adept at managing time-critical shipments. We maintain constant communication with third-party transportation providers from dispatch through final delivery. As a result, our expedited services are capable of meeting virtually any customer transit or delivery requirement. Finally, we provide the ability to track and trace shipments either online or by phone through one of our transportation specialists.

5


• | Audit and Payment Services. We capture and consolidate our customers’ entire shipping activity and offer weekly electronic billing. We also provide freight bill audit and payment services designed to eliminate excessive or incorrect charges from our customers’ bills.


• | Performance Reporting and Improvement Analysis. Customers utilizing our web reporting system have the ability to review freight bills, develop customized reports online, and access data to assist in financial and operational reporting and planning. Our specialists are also actively driving process improvement by continuously using our technology to identify incremental savings opportunities and efficiencies for our customers.


• | Freight Consolidation and Warehousing. We have 2.5 million square feet of warehousing space strategically located throughout the United States, which includes temperature controlled areas and food-grade sections. We provide access to our state-of-the-art warehouse management system, which provides customers with complete inventory visibility and a robust tool for inventory management. 

With a broad Global Solutions offering, we believe we can accommodate a shipper’s unique needs with any combination of services along our entire spectrum, and cater to their preferred means of shipment processing and communication.
We believe our comprehensive service approach and focus on building long-term customer relationships lead to greater retention of existing business compared to a more short-term gain sharing model employed by many 3PL providers. Before becoming fully operational with a customer, we conduct thorough feasibility and cost savings analyses and collaborate with the customer to create a project scope and timeline with measurable milestones. We believe this approach enables us to identify any potential issues, ensure a smooth integration process, and set the stage for long-term customer satisfaction. Within our Global Solutions operation, we have consistently met customer implementation deadlines and achieved anticipated levels of freight savings. 
Capacity
We offer scalable capacity and reliable service to our extensive customer base in North America through a diverse third-party network of transportation providers and company drivers. Our various transportation modes include TL, LTL intermodal, and domestic and international air. No single carrier accounted for more than 2% of our 2016 purchased transportation costs. We ensure that each carrier is properly licensed and we regularly monitor each carrier's capacity, reliability, and pricing trends. Enhanced visibility provided by our technology systems allows us to leverage the competitive dynamics within our network to renegotiate freight rates and provide our customers with more cost-effective transportation solutions while enhancing our operating margins.
We continuously focus on building and enhancing our relationships with reliable transportation providers to ensure that we not only secure competitive rates, but that we also gain access to consistent capacity. These relationships are critical to our success based on our asset-right transportation and asset-light logistics service provider business model. We typically pay our third-party carriers either a contracted per mile rate or the cost of a shipment less our contractually agreed-upon commission, and generally pay within seven to ten days from the date the shipment is delivered. We pay our third-party carriers promptly in order to drive loyalty and reliable capacity.
Our network of transportation providers can be divided into the following groups:
Independent Contractors. ICs are a key part of our long-term strategy to maintain service and provide cost stability. As of December 31, 2016, we had over 2,700 ICs, which consisted of over 2,300 linehaul, truckload, and intermodal services ICs and over 400 local delivery ICs. In selecting our ICs, we adhere to specific screening guidelines in terms of safety records, length of driving experience, and evaluations. In the event of tightening of over-the-road freight capacity, we believe we are well positioned to increase our utilization of ICs as a cost-effective and reliable solution.
To enhance our relationship with our ICs, we offer per mile rates that we believe are highly competitive and often above prevailing market rates. In addition, we focus on keeping our ICs fully utilized in order to limit the number of “empty” miles they drive. We regularly communicate with our ICs and seek new ways to enhance their quality of life. We believe our efforts increase IC retention, which we believe ultimately leads to better service for our customers.
Purchased Power Providers. In addition to our large base of ICs, we have access to a broad base of purchased power providers. We have established relationships with carriers of all sizes, including large national trucking companies and small to mid-size regional fleets. With the exception of safety incentives, purchased power providers are generally paid under a similar structure as ICs within our LTL and TL businesses. In contrast to contracts established with our ICs, however, we do not cover the cost of liability insurance for our purchased power providers.
Company Drivers. We employ over 1,500 drivers across our businesses. 
6

Delivery Agents. For the de-consolidation and delivery stages of our LTL shipment process, our 44 LTL service centers are complemented by over 150 third-party delivery agents. The use of delivery agents is also a key part of our long-term strategy to maintain a variable cost and scalable operating model with minimal overhead.
Intermodal Capabilities. We maintain intermodal capability within our TL segment and through relationships with third-party carriers who rent capacity on Class 1 railroads throughout North America. Intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the capacity provider on a customer-specific basis.
Flight Operations. We support air freight services, including expedited delivery, with 11 cargo jets, 66 flight operations personnel, including pilots, ground crew, and flight coordinators, and a network of third party air cargo providers.
Ground Expedite. We utilize proprietary bid technology supported by our logistics personnel and our network of over-the-road ICs and purchased power providers. 
Customers
Our goal is to establish long-term customer relationships and achieve year-over-year growth in recurring business by providing reliable, timely, and cost-effective transportation and logistics solutions. We possess the scale, operational expertise, and capabilities to serve shippers of all sizes. We serve an extensive customer base within a variety of end markets, with one direct customer accounting for approximately 12% of 2016 revenue. Our diverse customer base reduces our exposure to a decline in shipping demand from any one customer and a cyclical downturn within any particular end market.
Sales and Marketing
In addition to over 90 independent brokerage agents and 40 company brokers, we currently market and sell our transportation and logistics solutions through sales personnel located throughout the United States. We are focused on actively expanding our sales force to new geographic markets where we lack a strong presence. 
As of December 31, 2016, our sales force extends into each service offering as follows:

• | Truckload Logistics. We had 40 company brokers and over 90 independent brokerage agents located throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Additionally, we had a sales team consisting of both sales managers and inside sales representatives. We believe that this sales structure enables our salespeople to better serve our customers by developing an understanding of local and regional market conditions, as well as the specific transportation and logistics issues facing individual customers. Our brokers, brokerage agents, and sales team seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on this knowledge and an understanding of the value proposition we can provide. 


• | Less-than-Truckload. Our LTL sales team of over 80 people consisted of account executives, sales managers, inside sales representatives, and commissioned sales representatives.


• | Global Solutions. We had over 60 Global Solutions salespeople, commissioned sales representatives, and agents.

Competition
We compete in the North American transportation and logistics services sector. Our marketplace is extremely competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with a large number of other asset-light logistics companies, asset-based carriers, integrated logistics companies, and third-party freight brokers, many of whom have larger customer bases and more resources than we do.
In our markets, we compete with global asset-based integrated logistics companies such as FedEx Corporation, United Parcel Service, Inc., and XPO Logistics, Inc., against whom we compete in all of our service lines; asset-based freight haulers, such as Arkansas Best Corporation, Old Dominion Freight Line Inc., and YRC Worldwide, Inc., against whom we compete in our core TL and LTL service offerings; non-asset based and asset-light freight brokerage companies, such as C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., Echo Global Logistics, Inc., and Landstar System, Inc., against whom we compete in all of our service offerings; 3PL providers that offer comprehensive transportation management solutions, such as Schneider Logistics, Inc. and Transplace, Inc., against whom we compete in our Global Solutions offering; and smaller, niche transportation and logistics companies that provide services within a specific geographic region or end market. In our international freight forwarding business, we compete with a large number of service providers. Depending on the trade lane and solution, these competitors include large multi-national, such as Expeditors International of Washington, Inc., Kuehne & Nagel International AG / ADR, and DHL Global Supply Chain, regional, such as Mallory Alexander International Logistics and Laufer Group International and, local, or niche providers. As a result, our focus remains on continuing to provide our customers with exceptional service. 
We believe we compete favorably by offering shippers attractive transportation and logistics solutions designed to deliver the optimal combination of cost and service. To that end, we believe our most significant competitive advantages include:
7


• | our comprehensive suite of transportation and logistics services, which allows us to offer à la carte or a full portfolio value proposition to shippers of varying sizes and to accommodate their diverse needs and preferred means of processing and communication;


• | our asset-right transportation and asset-light logistics service provider, variable cost business model, which allows us to generate strong free cash flows and focus greater attention on providing optimal customer service than on asset utilization;


• | our technology systems, which allow us to provide scalable capacity and a high level of customer service across a variety of transportation modes; and


• | our knowledgeable management team with experience leading high-growth logistics companies and/or business units, which allows us to benefit from a collective entrepreneurial culture focused on growth.

Seasonality
Our operations are subject to seasonal trends that have been common in the North American over-the-road freight sector for many years. Our results of operations for the quarter ending in March are on average lower than the quarters ending in June, September, and December. Typically, this pattern has been the result of factors such as inclement weather, national holidays, customer demand, and economic conditions. 
Technology
We believe the continued development and innovation of our technology systems is important to providing our customers with the most cost-effective, timely, and reliable transportation and logistics solutions. Our objective is to allow our customers and vendors to easily do business with us via technology. Our customers have the ability, through a paperless process, to receive immediate pricing, place orders, track shipments, process remittance, receive updates, and review historical shipping data through a variety of reports over the Internet. We provide flexibility for customers and vendors by utilizing multiple technologies, including web, mobile, workflow and EDI.
Our TL operation uses technology to broker our customers’ freight. Our software enhances our ability to track our third-party drivers, tractors, and trailers, which provides customers with visibility into their supply chains. Additionally, our systems allow us to operate as a paperless operation through electronic order entry, resource planning, and dispatch. Our TL operations also utilize spot bid technology to manage expedited customers' logistics needs.
Our LTL operation utilizes a web-based system with our transportation management applications. Additionally, we make use of EDI to allow our service centers to communicate electronically with our carriers’ and customers’ internal systems. We offer our customers a paperless process, including document imaging and shipment tracking and tracing. 
Our Global Solutions operation uses a variety of software applications and systems customized to meet the unique needs of our customers. We continuously enhance our applications and systems to help improve our productivity, increase customer visibility, and improve collaboration with our service providers, all while offering customizable content for our customers. Our web-based technology approach allows our Global Solutions operation to process and service customer orders, track shipments in real time, select optimal modes of transportation, execute customer billing, provide carrier rates, establish customer-specific profiles, and retain critical information for analysis while providing a company branded solution.  We utilize this approach to maximize supply chain efficiency through mode, carrier, and route optimization.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 4,645 personnel, which included 41 management personnel, 100 sales and marketing personnel, 2,269 operations and other personnel, 1,553 company drivers, and 616 dock personnel. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider relations with our employees to be good.

Regulation
The federal government substantially deregulated the provision of ground transportation and logistics services via the enactment of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994, and the ICC Termination Act of 1995. Prices and services are now largely free of regulatory controls, although states have the right to require compliance with safety and insurance requirements, and interstate motor carriers remain subject to regulatory controls imposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and its agencies, such as the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”). Motor carrier, freight forwarding, and freight brokerage operations are subject to safety, insurance, and bonding requirements prescribed by the DOT and various state agencies. Any air freight business is subject to commercial standards set forth by the IATA and federal regulations issued by the TSA.
We are also subject to the Compliance, Safety, and Accountability Program (“CSA”), which is the FMCSA safety program designed to improve large truck and bus safety and ultimately reduce crashes. CSA is an enforcement and compliance model that involves assessments of a motor carrier's on-road performance and investigation results for a 24-month period using roadside stops and inspections, resulting in safety performance in the following categories: unsafe driving; hours-of-service compliance; driver fitness; controlled substances/alcohol; vehicle maintenance; hazardous material compliance; and crash indicator. The evaluations are then used by the FMCSA to select carriers for audit and other interventions.
As part of our acquisition of Active Aero, we acquired USA Jet Airlines (“USA Jet”), which holds certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the DOT pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 41102 and an air carrier certificate granted by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) pursuant to Part 119 of the federal aviation regulations. The DOT, the FAA, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), through the TSA, have regulatory authority over USA Jet’s air transportation services. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, is the statutory basis for DOT and the FAA authority and the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, is the basis for TSA aviation security authority.
The FAA’s authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and maintenance, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of USA Jet to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. The air carrier certificate granted to USA Jet by the FAA remains in effect so long as we meet the safety and operational requirements of the applicable FAA regulations. 
The DOT’s authority relates primarily to economic licensing aspects of air transportation. The DOT’s jurisdiction extends to authorized types of operations and aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. USA Jet holds various certificates issued by the DOT, including a domestic certificate authorizing USA Jet to engage in U.S. air transportation and a foreign certificate authorizing international air transportation of property. In addition, USA Jet is subject to non-U.S. government regulation of aviation rights involving non-U.S. jurisdictions, and non-U.S. customs regulation.
The TSA has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA continues to require USA Jet to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program and the Twelve-Five Standard Security Program, which contain evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. 
We are also subject to various environmental and safety requirements, including those governing the handling, disposal, and release of hazardous materials, which we may be asked to transport in the course of our operations. If hazardous materials are released into the environment while being transported, we may be required to participate in, or may have liability for response costs and the remediation of such a release. In such a case, we also may be subject to claims for personal injury, property damage, and damage to natural resources. Our business is also subject to changes in legislation and regulations, which can affect our operations and those of our competitors. For example, new laws and initiatives to reduce and mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions could significantly impact the transportation industry. Future environmental laws in this area could adversely affect our ICs’ costs and practices and consequently, our operations.
We are also subject to regulations to combat terrorism that the DHS and other agencies impose. 
The international freight forwarding and customs brokerage services provided by our Global Solutions business are regulated by a variety of regulatory agencies and bodies including, but not limited to: the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”), the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) and the TSA within the DHS (customs brokerage and security issues); the IATA; the DOT; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”); the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”); the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”); the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Products and Firearms (“BATF”); the U.S. Census Bureau; and other agencies or world governing bodies regulating international trade and compliance. Regulations and requirements must be strictly adhered to and can change periodically. Additionally, our Global Solutions business manages customer activities in numerous countries. As such, there may be risk associated with sudden fluctuations in currency, changes in economic policy, political unrest, changes to

tariffs and trade policies/restrictions that are all outside of our control. Compliance with these changes may have a material impact on our operations and may increase our costs to service our customers.
Insurance
We insure our ICs and company drivers against third-party claims for accidents or damaged shipments and we bear the risk of such claims. We maintain insurance for auto liability, general liability, and cargo damage claims. We maintain an aggregate of $100 million of auto liability and general liability insurance. We maintain auto liability insurance coverage for claims in excess of $1.0 million per occurrence and cargo coverage for claims in excess of $100,000 per occurrence. Because we maintain insurance for our ICs, if our insurance does not cover all or any portion of the claim amount, we may be forced to bear the financial loss. We attempt to mitigate this risk by carefully selecting carriers with quality control procedures and safety ratings.
In addition to auto liability, general liability, and cargo claim coverage, our insurance policies also cover other standard industry risks related to workers’ compensation and other property and casualty risks. We are self-insured up to $1.0 million for workers compensation. We believe our insurance coverage is comparable in terms and amount of coverage to other companies in our industry. We establish insurance reserves for anticipated losses and expenses and periodically evaluate and adjust the reserves to reflect our experience.

ABL Facility
On July 21, 2017, we entered into a credit agreement with BMO Harris Bank, N.A. and certain other lenders (the “ABL Facility”). The ABL Facility consists of a $200.0 million asset-based revolving line of credit, of which $20.0 million may be used for swing line loans and $30.0 million may be used for letters of credit, a $56.8 million term loan facility, and a $35.0 million asset-based facility available to finance future capital expenditures. We used the initial proceeds from the ABL Facility for working capital purposes and to redeem all 240,500 shares of our Series F Preferred Stock.

Sale of Unitrans
On September 15, 2017, we completed the sale of Unitrans, Inc. (“Unitrans”) for cash consideration of $95.0 million. We used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of Unitrans to redeem 52,500 shares of our Series E Preferred Stock. See Note 16 “Subsequent Events” to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further information.
Enactment of US Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into United States law, and most changes are effective as of January 1, 2018. The law includes various provisions that will affect corporations, including a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from a 35% maximum rate to a 21% flat rate, enhanced “bonus depreciation” for capital equipment purchases, limitations on interest expense deductions, changes to net operating loss carryback and carryforward rules, and changes to US taxation of foreign profits. The corporate tax rate reduction is expected to result in a discrete tax benefit during the three months ended December 31, 2017 as a result of recalculating the carrying value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. See Note 16 “Subsequent Events” to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further information.
