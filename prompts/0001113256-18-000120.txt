Overview

 Meritor, Inc. ("we", "us" or "our"), headquartered in Troy, Michigan, is a premier global supplier of a broad range of integrated systems, modules and components to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and the aftermarket for the commercial vehicle, transportation and industrial sectors. We serve commercial truck, trailer, military, bus and coach, construction, and other industrial OEMs and certain aftermarkets. Our principal products are axles, undercarriages, drivelines and brakes.

Meritor was incorporated in Indiana in 2000 in connection with the merger of Meritor Automotive, Inc. and Arvin Industries, Inc. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms "company," "Meritor," "we," "us" and "our" include Meritor, its consolidated subsidiaries and its predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise.

Meritor serves a broad range of customers worldwide, including medium- and heavy-duty truck OEMs, specialty vehicle manufacturers, certain aftermarkets, and trailer producers. Our total sales from continuing operations in fiscal year 2018 were approximately $4.2 billion. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 75 percent of fiscal year 2018 sales from continuing operations. Sales from operations outside North America accounted for approximately 38 percent of total sales from continuing operations in fiscal year 2018. Our continuing operations also participated in four unconsolidated joint ventures, which we accounted for under the equity method of accounting and that generated revenues of approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2018.

Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest to September 30. Fiscal year 2018 ended on September 30, 2018, fiscal year 2017 ended on October 1, 2017, and fiscal year 2016 ended on October 2, 2016. All year and quarter references relate to our fiscal year and fiscal quarters unless otherwise stated. For ease of presentation, September 30 is utilized consistently throughout this report to represent the fiscal year end.

M2019 Growth-Focused Plan 
As we look forward to completing the last year of our M2019 plan, we made significant progress in fiscal year 2018 toward our objectives. The financial targets we set for this plan are the following:
•Grow revenue at 20 percent cumulatively above market levels, measured from the end of fiscal year 2015
•Increase adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $1.25, measured from fiscal year 2015
•Reduce the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA to less than 1.5
(see Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Item 7)
To achieve these targets, we remain focused on three main priorities:
•Exceeding customer expectations
•Transforming to a growth-oriented organization
•Continuing to invest in employees
Exceed Customer Expectations
For more than 100 years, our products have evolved to meet the changing needs of our customers in major regions of the world. As technology has advanced, we have designed products that are more fuel efficient, lighter weight, safer, more durable and more reliable. The Meritor brand is well established globally and reflects a broad and growing portfolio of high-quality products for various applications.
Over the past years, we worked hard to become an innovation partner to our customers. From concept to launch, we work closely together to ensure we are designing reliable and high quality products that meet or exceed their expectations now and in the future. In addition to technology and product collaboration, we also meet regularly with our customers to review our performance in a number of other areas including quality, delivery and cost.
In our M2019 plan, we set an overall quality target of 25 parts per million ("PPM"). We believe this will further differentiate us in the commercial vehicle industry. In fiscal year 2018, Daimler Trucks North America awarded four Meritor production sites with Masters of Quality Awards. An additional three facilities earned the PACCAR's 10 PPM Quality Award that is given to suppliers who meet or exceed its rigorous standard of 10 or fewer defective parts for every 1 million parts shipped to this customer.
We want to continue the excellent delivery performance we have demonstrated at greater than 99 percent. This year, we were proud to receive the 100 Percent Delivery Award from Hino Motors Manufacturing U.S.A., Inc. for perfect on-time delivery of dressed drive and steer axles. Meritor builds the drive and front steer axles for all of Hino's medium-duty conventional cab models in North America. On-time delivery is critical because axles are among the first parts placed on the manufacturer's truck assembly line. 
In addition to recognition from our customers for outstanding quality and delivery, we also received a Gold Award from Ashok Leyland in India for new product development for the design of a unique slipper suspension for haulage trucks and assisting the truck manufacturer with the migration to a new emission standard. This new suspension has unique and patented design features that include a lighter-weight design compared to conventional suspensions, and offers a significant reduction in service time and maintenance costs with less tire wear due to more efficient axle alignment. And in Australia, we earned the Penske Supplier of the Year Award for outstanding sales, customer service and marketing support, and maintaining a consistently high fill rate of 95 percent. These recognitions reflect our focus on maintaining excellent customer relationships globally and will continue to be an area to which we devote significant attention. 
We will maintain our focus on driving down operating costs through material cost-reduction and labor and burden improvements with a target achievement of 1.5 percent improvement per year. We are continuing to drive material performance with three different approaches: commercial negotiations, best-cost-country sourcing and technical innovation. And, we are improving in labor and burden by addressing several areas simultaneously including better equipment utilization, reduced changeover time, elimination of waste, improved shift and asset utilization, investing in equipment to improve cycle time and flexibility and employee involvement.

We believe we effectively manage complexity for low volumes and support our customers’ needs during periods of peak volumes. The quality, durability and on-time delivery of our products has earned us strong positions in the markets we support. As we seek to extend and expand our business with existing customers and establish relationships with new ones, our objective is to ensure we are getting a fair value for the recognized benefits of our products and services and the strong brand equity we hold in the marketplace.
Transform to a Growth-Oriented Organization
We know that despite changes and volatility in global market conditions, it is important that we generate profitable top-line growth. We have designed the M2019 plan to enable us to achieve the growth we are targeting while operating in a cyclical industry that can be greatly impacted by economic and political factors. We are increasing our market share with key customers, renewing long-term contracts and winning new business in all of our regions around the globe across both of our reportable segments. 
We have increased the pace of product introduction, which is a key component to growing revenue. Prior to our M2016 plan, we launched approximately three major programs annually. We are developing these jointly with our customers for their future product programs, and we have line of sight to revenue streams for each of these products. In fiscal year 2018, we launched the following six products:

• | Optimized EX+ Air Disc Brake - Built to maximize productivity by reducing maintenance time and costs, the gear synchronized, twin-piston design delivers even force across the brake pads simultaneously resulting in better performance and uniform pad wear.


• | 79000 Series Axle - Designed to help municipal transit fleets meet federal and industry durability guidelines. By more than tripling the durability of previous offerings, fleets may only need to replace the axle’s carrier once instead of multiple times during the vehicle’s service life in this heavy stop-and-go segment.


• | ZL50+ Loader Axle - Designed for the off-highway construction market in China, specifically for loaders.


• | MT-610 Hub Reduction Axle - DAF Trucks, subsidiary of PACCAR, has equipped its next-generation, heavy-duty lineup for European long-haul and off-road applications with a hub-reduction tandem axle developed by Meritor. Designed for extreme applications, the axle's fast ratios allow the engine to run at lower rpms, improving fuel efficiency for end-users. 


• | DuaLite 156 Axle - Specifically produced for the China bus market with low noise and high efficiency design.


• | MTC-3203 Transfer Case - Designed for the medium-duty all-wheel drive market and launched with Navistar and Chevrolet.

We expect to continue to broaden our relationships with our global strategic customers, earn the business of new customers, increase aftermarket share in our core product areas, expand our components business by utilizing our time-proven core competencies of forging, machining and gear manufacturing, and enter near adjacent markets and products that we believe will be a good match with our core competencies.
AB Volvo is Meritor’s largest global customer with the majority of that business being in Europe. Last year, we extended our long-term agreement with Volvo for an additional three years to 2024. Under the terms of this agreement, Meritor will design and deliver a new family of heavy, single reduction rear axles for both Volvo and Renault brands. These newly designed products will feature fuel efficiency improvement, faster ratios and a higher gross combined weight rating to enable more payload per truck. We also support Volvo in Thailand and India.
During fiscal year 2018, we delivered strong operational execution, won new business and increased market share with key customers in major markets. Meritor was awarded important new contracts with customers globally including front and rear axles for MAN’s new delivery truck, axle business with Mercedes Benz and Iveco for school buses in South America, axle and suspension business with Tata, Kenworth and Ashok Leyland in Asia Pacific, and several new awards for Meritor’s hub reduction axle around the world. In our Defense business, we have a new contract with Mack Defense for a rear beam and front drive steer axle, as well as drivelines and transfer cases for approximately 700 trucks.
In the electric vehicle space, Meritor currently has 22 active programs across the globe on applications including school buses, yard tractors, medium duty trucks, urban buses and refuse trucks. In addition to supporting these programs with core Meritor content, including front and rear suspensions, wheel ends, drum and disc brakes and gearboxes, Meritor is also offering its 
4

proprietary eAxle and other products now part of its portfolio as a result of our strategic alliance with TransPower. In fiscal year 2018, we earned new business in the electric space with customers including Daimler Trucks North America (DTNA) for its innovation fleet, and with Thomas Built Bus, a subsidiary of DTNA, Ashok Leyland, Kalmar and Peterbilt. For Peterbilt, we will supply all-electric drivetrain systems for two vehicle platforms that will include 12 all-electric Class 8 day cab tractors and three refuse trucks.
As we strive to grow our aftermarket business, we took various actions this year to better serve our customers, including launching the North America Authorized Rebuilder Program for drive axle carriers, including our 145, 14X TM and 160 products. We are partnering with exceptional rebuilders that share our commitment to helping fleets maximize uptime with coast-to-coast, 24-hour guaranteed delivery of highly reliable, rebuilt carriers which meet original performance specifications, Also this year, we launched a comprehensive portfolio of products designed to deliver the right parts, performance and price for each life stage of trucks, trailers and buses. As an example, the MachTM parts brand is designed for customers seeking high-value, delivering quality all-makes parts that improve uptime at affordable prices, while the Meritor® and Euclid® brands offer top-quality aftermarket parts at more affordable prices. Meritor Genuine brand is designed for newer vehicles still under warranty or for customers who want to maintain original performance and maximize uptime with OEM production parts. Meritor is one of the few suppliers that manufactures or approves for sale lifecycle aftermarket parts that include support and availability.
While we are planning for the majority of Meritor's growth to be organic, we anticipate allocating capital for targeted acquisitions that could be an accelerant in our growth trajectory. To that end, this year we acquired substantially all of the assets of AA Gear & Manufacturing, Inc. and its subsidiaries. This transaction provides our components business with a suite of process engineering and production capabilities for gear and shaft components that will enable us to offer new products and applications. In August, we announced a new five-year contract for a near-net forged part in which Meritor will produce more than three million pieces. Start of production is 2020.
As industry trends continue to drive the need for equipment that complies with environmental and safety-related regulatory provisions, OEMs select suppliers based not only on the cost and quality of their products, but also on their ability to meet stringent environmental and safety requirements and to service and support the customer after the sale. We use our technological and market expertise to develop and engineer products that address mobility, safety, regulatory and environmental concerns.
Our commitment to designing and manufacturing braking solutions for the commercial vehicle market has resulted in more commercial vehicles in North America having Meritor brakes than any other brake manufacturer. We believe Meritor’s EX+ air disc brakes are among the highest performing brakes in the marketplace. In Europe, a region where air disc brakes are much more widely adopted, we have sold more than 6 million ELSA air disc brakes - a testament to the quality, reliability and performance of this brake platform.
We believe the quality of our core product lines, our ability to service our products through our aftermarket capabilities, and our sales and service support teams give us a competitive advantage. An important element of being a preferred supplier is the ability to deliver service through the entire life cycle of the product. Also, as our industry becomes more international, our manufacturing footprint around the world and our ability to supply customers with regionally-tailored product solutions are competencies of increasing importance.
Invest in Employees
The safety of our employees is our top priority. Total case rate is a measure of recordable workplace injuries normalized per 100 employees per year. Our target for M2019 is to achieve a rate of less than 0.65. In fiscal year 2018, we achieved an overall case rate of 0.72 injuries per 200,000 hours. Our safety rate in fiscal year 2018 was slightly unfavorable to fiscal year 2017. This was due in large part to the 15-percent increase in hours worked in our manufacturing facilities this year due to peak markets in North America and high production demand globally. Even with the significant increase in hours, sixteen of our 40 measured facilities had no recordable incidents in the entire fiscal year. We attribute this to the diligence of our employees and the safety programs and equipment we have instituted throughout our global operations to protect them. In an effort to continually improve our safety rate, we will maintain our diligence through training and education of our employees, reducing certain behaviors that are known to create safety issues and continue to maximize risk identification and hazard assessment. 
We will also continue to drive the close alignment of our global Meritor team to M2019. Such alignment was a key driver of the success we experienced in our previous M2016 strategic plan. We believe that our strength to compete in the global market is dependent upon the engagement of every Meritor employee and that a high-performing team is critical to the level of performance we want to achieve. We have a strong and experienced leadership group and a committed team, both of which are focused on sustaining the strong foundation we built in M2016 and delivering on our M2019 performance objectives. We will also continue to diversify our workforce because we recognize the value of different opinions and backgrounds in a company as global as Meritor.

We have established various development and training programs to help our employees grow as we grow. This year, we continued the leadership development programs for managers, directors and senior leaders around the world. For managers, we offered eLearning modules and courses that address important areas for advancement including accountability, delegation, and providing and receiving feedback. For certain director-level employees, we led our second annual Leadership Edge - a 10-month program whose objective is to develop advanced leadership skills, prepare high-potential leaders for senior level positions and strengthen business acumen. And for certain senior-level leaders, we continued the Summit, which provides executive coaching, the opportunity to attend specific executive training sessions tailored to each individual’s background and career goals, participation in a MBA-level finance course, if needed, and engagement in mentorship opportunities with a member of Meritor’s Board of Directors. To ensure we provide a rich experience for our employees, we will continue to measure employee engagement to build on the competencies that are important to our future.
Products

 Meritor designs, develops, manufactures, markets, distributes, sells, services and supports a broad range of products for use in the transportation and industrial sectors. In addition to sales of original equipment systems and components, we provide our original equipment, aftermarket and remanufactured products to vehicle OEMs, their dealers (who in turn sell to motor carriers and commercial vehicle users of all sizes), independent distributors, and other end-users in certain aftermarkets.
The following chart sets forth, for each of the fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, information about product sales comprising more than 10% of consolidated revenue in any of those years. A narrative description of our principal products follows the chart.

Other | 2 | % | | 2 | % | 2 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Axles, Undercarriage & Drivelines

We believe we are one of the world's leading independent suppliers of axles for medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, with the leading market position in axle manufacturing in North America, South America and Europe, and are one of the major axle manufacturers in the Asia-Pacific region. Our extensive truck axle product line includes a wide range of front steer axles and rear drive axles. Our front steer and rear drive axles can be equipped with our cam, wedge or air disc brakes, automatic slack adjusters, and complete wheel-end equipment such as hubs, rotors and drums.
We supply heavy-duty axles in certain global regions for use in numerous off-highway vehicle applications, including construction, material handling, and mining. We also supply axles for use in military tactical wheeled vehicles, principally in North America. These products are designed to tolerate high tonnage and operate under extreme conditions. In addition, we have other off-highway vehicle products that are currently in development for certain other regions. We also supply axles for use in buses, coaches and recreational vehicles, fire trucks and other specialty vehicles in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe, and we believe we are a leading supplier of bus and coach axles in North America.

We are one of the major manufacturers of heavy-duty trailer axles in North America. Our trailer axles are available in more than 40 models in capacities from 20,000 to 30,000 pounds for virtually all heavy trailer applications and are available with our broad range of suspension modules and brake products, including drum brakes and disc brakes.

We supply universal joints and driveline components, including our Permalube™ universal joint and RPL Permalube™ driveline, which are maintenance free, permanently lubricated designs used often in the high mileage on-highway market. We supply drivelines in North America for use in numerous on-highway vehicle applications. We supply transfer cases and drivelines for use in military tactical wheeled vehicles, principally in North America. We also supply transfer cases for use in specialty vehicles in North America. In addition, we supply trailer air suspension systems and products with an increasing market presence 
6

in North America. We also supply advanced suspension modules for use in light-, medium- and heavy-duty military tactical wheeled vehicles, principally in North America.

Brakes and Brake-Related Components

We believe we are one of the leading independent suppliers of air brakes to medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicle manufacturers in North America and Europe. In Brazil, we believe that Master Sistemas Automotivos Limitada, our 49%-owned joint venture with Randon S. A. Implementos e Participações, is a leading supplier of brakes and brake-related products.
 Through manufacturing facilities located in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe, we manufacture a broad range of foundation air brakes, as well as automatic slack adjusters for brake systems. Our foundation air brake products include cam drum brakes, which offer improved lining life and tractor/trailer interchangeability; wedge drum brakes, which are lightweight and provide automatic internal wear adjustment; air disc brakes, which provide enhanced stopping distance and improved fade resistance for demanding applications; and wheel-end components such as hubs, drums and rotors.

Our brakes and brake system components also are used in military tactical wheeled vehicles, principally in North America. We also supply brakes for use in buses, coaches and recreational vehicles, fire trucks and other specialty vehicles in North America and Europe, and we believe we are the leading supplier of bus and coach brakes in North America. We also supply brakes for commercial vehicles, buses and coaches in Asia Pacific.
Other Products

In addition to the products discussed above, we sell other complementary products, including third-party and private label items, through our aftermarket distribution channels. These products are generally sold under master distribution or similar agreements with outside vendors and include brake shoes and friction materials; automatic slack adjusters; yokes and shafts; wheel-end hubs and drums; ABS and stability control systems; shock absorbers and air springs; and air brakes.
Customers; Sales and Marketing

We have numerous customers worldwide and have developed long-standing business relationships with many of these customers. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 75 percent of our total sales in fiscal year 2018. Sales to our largest three customers, AB Volvo, Daimler AG and PACCAR, represented approximately 23 percent, 17 percent and 12 percent, respectively, of our sales in fiscal year 2018. No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales in fiscal year 2018.
 Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)

In North America, we design, engineer, market and sell products principally to OEMs, dealers and distributors. While our North American sales are typically direct to OEMs, our ultimate commercial truck customers include trucking and transportation fleets. Fleet customers may specify our components and integrated systems for installation in the vehicles they purchase from OEMs. We employ what we refer to as a "push-pull" marketing strategy. We "push" for being the standard product at the OEM. At the same time, our district field managers then call on fleets and OEM dealers to "pull-through" our components on specific truck purchases. For all other markets, we specifically design, engineer, market and sell products principally to OEMs for their market-specific needs or product specifications.

For certain large OEM customers, our supply arrangements are negotiated on a long-term contract basis for a multi-year period that may require us to provide annual cost reductions through price reductions or other cost benefits for the OEMs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cost savings in the future to offset such price reductions, our gross margins will be adversely affected. Sales to other OEMs are typically made through open order releases or purchase orders at market-based prices that do not require the purchase of a minimum number of products. The customer typically has the right to cancel or delay these orders on reasonable notice. We typically compete to either retain business or try to win new business from OEMs when long-term contracts expire. 

We have established leading positions in many of the markets we serve as a global supplier of a broad range of drivetrain systems, brakes and components. Based on available industry data and internal company estimates, our market-leading positions include independent truck drive axles (i.e., those manufactured by an independent, non-captive supplier) in North America, Europe, South America and India through a joint venture; truck drivelines in North America; truck air brakes in North America and South America (through a joint venture); and military wheeled vehicle drivetrains, suspensions and brakes in North America.

Our global customer portfolio includes AB Volvo, Daimler AG, PACCAR, Navistar International Corporation, Oshkosh, MAN, CNH Industrial, Ashok Leyland, Scania, XCMG, Wabash National, Gillig and Ford.

Aftermarket

We market and sell truck, trailer, off-highway and other products principally to, and service such products principally for, OEMs, their parts marketing operations, their dealers and other independent distributors and service garages within the aftermarket industry. Our product sales are generated through long-term agreements with certain of our OEM customers and distribution agreements and sales to independent dealers and distributors. Sales to other OEMs are typically made through open order releases or purchase orders at market-based prices, which do not require the purchase of a minimum number of products. The customer typically has the right to cancel or delay these orders on reasonable notice.

Our product offerings allow us to service all stages of our customers’ vehicle ownership lifecycle. In North America, we stock and distribute thousands of parts from top national brands to our customers or what we refer to as our "all makes" strategy. Our district field managers call on our OEM's, OEM dealers, fleet customers and independent customers to market our full product line capabilities on a regular basis to seek to ensure that we satisfy our customers’ needs. Our aftermarket business sells products under the following brand names: Meritor, Euclid, Trucktechnic and Mach.

Based on available industry data and internal company estimates, we believe our North America aftermarket business has the overall market leadership position for the portfolio of products that we offer. 
Competition

We compete worldwide with a number of North American and international providers of components and systems, some of which are owned by or associated with some of our customers. The principal competitive factors are price, quality, service, product performance, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation and timely delivery. Certain OEMs manufacture their own components that compete with the types of products we supply.

Our major competitors for axles are Dana Incorporated and, in certain markets, OEMs that manufacture axles for use in their own products. Emerging competitors for axles include DTNA’s Detroit Axle, ZF Friedrichshafen in Europe, and Hande, Fuwa and Ankai in China. Our major competitors for brakes are Bendix/Knorr Bremse, WABCO and, in certain markets, OEMs that manufacture brakes for use in their own products. Our major competitors for industrial applications are MAN, AxleTech International, Oshkosh, AM General, Marmon-Herrington, Dana Incorporated, Knorr Bremse, Kessler & Co., Carraro, NAF, Sisu and, in certain markets, OEMs that manufacture industrial products for use in their own vehicles. Our major competitors for trailer applications are Fuwa, Hendrickson and SAF-Holland.
Raw Materials and Suppliers

Our purchases of raw materials and parts are concentrated over a limited number of suppliers. We are dependent upon our suppliers' ability to meet cost performance targets, quality specifications and delivery schedules. The inability of a supplier to meet these requirements, the loss of a significant supplier, or work stoppages could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customers' delivery requirements.
The cost of our core products is susceptible to changes in overall steel commodity prices, including ingredients used for various grades of steel. We have generally structured our major steel supplier and customer contracts to absorb and pass on normal index-related market fluctuations in steel prices. While we have had steel pricing adjustment programs in place with most major OEMs, the price adjustment programs tend to lag behind the movement in steel costs and have generally not contemplated non-steel index related increases. 
Significant future volatility in the commodity markets or a deterioration in product demand may require us to pursue customer price increases through surcharges or other pricing arrangements. In addition, if suppliers are inadequate for our needs, or if prices remain at current levels or increase and we are unable to either pass these prices to our customer base or otherwise mitigate the costs, our operating results could be further adversely affected.
We continuously work to address these competitive challenges by reducing costs and, as needed, restructuring operations. We manage supplier risk by conducting periodic assessments for all major suppliers and more frequent rigorous assessments of high-risk suppliers. On an ongoing basis, we monitor third-party financial statements, conduct surveys through supplier questionnaires, and conduct site visits. We have developed a supplier improvement process where we identify and develop actions to address ongoing financial, quality and delivery issues to further mitigate potential risk. We are proactive in managing our supplier 
8

relationships to avoid supply disruption. Our process employs dual sourcing and resourcing trigger points that cause us to take aggressive actions and then monitor the progress closely. 
Acquisitions, Divestitures and Restructuring

As described above, our business strategies are focused on enhancing our market position by continuously evaluating the competitive differentiation of our product portfolio, focusing on our strengths and core competencies, and growing the businesses that offer the most attractive returns. Implementing these strategies involves various types of strategic initiatives.

As part of our M2019 plan, we are evaluating acquisition opportunities that fit strategically with our core competencies and growth initiatives and regularly review the prospects of our existing businesses to determine whether any of them should be modified, restructured, sold or otherwise discontinued. In fiscal year 2018, we completed a $6 million strategic investment in Transportation Power, Inc. ("TransPower") (see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below). In the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of AA Gear & Manufacturing, Inc. (see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below). In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we completed the sale of our equity interest in Meritor Huayang Vehicle Braking Company Ltd. (see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below). In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we closed on the sale of our interest in Meritor WABCO Vehicle Control Systems to a subsidiary of our joint venture partner, WABCO Holdings Inc. (see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below). In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we also completed the acquisition of the product portfolio and related technologies of Fabco Holdings, Inc. (see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below).

Segment Realignment Program: On March 12, 2018, we announced a realignment of operations to further drive long-term strategic objectives while also assigning new responsibilities as part of our commitment to leadership development. As a part of this program, we approved various labor restructuring actions in the Aftermarket & Industrial segment. We recorded $3 million of restructuring costs during fiscal year 2018 in connection with this program. These actions were substantially complete as of September 30, 2018. 
Other Restructuring Actions: During fiscal year 2018, we recorded restructuring costs of $3 million primarily associated with labor reduction programs in the Commercial Truck & Trailer segment and Aftermarket & Industrial segment. 
Fiscals 2017 & 2016 Aftermarket Actions: During the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we approved various restructuring plans in the North American and European Aftermarket businesses. We recorded $5 million of restructuring costs during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 and $4 million of restructuring costs during fiscal year 2017. Restructuring actions associated with these plans were substantially complete as of September 30, 2017. 
Fiscal 2016 Market Related Actions: In response to the decline in revenue in North America and South America, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we approved various headcount reduction plans targeting different areas of the business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we incurred a total of $5 million in restructuring costs in the Commercial Truck & Trailer segment, $1 million in the Aftermarket & Industrial segment and $2 million related to their corporate locations. Restructuring actions associated with these plans were substantially complete as of September 30, 2017. 
Other Fiscal 2016 Actions: During the first half of fiscal year 2016, we recorded restructuring costs of $3 million primarily associated with a labor reduction program in China in the Commercial Truck & Trailer segment and a labor reduction program in the Aftermarket & Industrial segment. Restructuring actions associated with these plans were substantially complete as of September 30, 2016.

Joint Ventures

As the industries in which we operate have become more globalized, joint ventures and other cooperative arrangements have become an important element of our business strategies. These strategic alliances provide for sales, product design, development and manufacturing in certain product and geographic areas. As of September 30, 2018, our continuing operations participated in the following non-consolidated joint ventures:

 | Key Products | Country
Master Sistemas Automotivos Limitada | Braking systems | Brazil 
Sistemas Automotrices de Mexico S.A. de C.V. | Axles, drivelines and brakes | Mexico 
Ege Fren Sanayii ve Ticaret A.S. | Braking systems | Turkey 
Automotive Axles Limited | Rear drive axle assemblies and braking systems | India 

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we closed on the sale of our interest in Meritor WABCO Vehicle Control Systems to a subsidiary of our joint venture partner, WABCO Holdings Inc. 
Aggregate sales of our non-consolidated joint ventures were $1,101 million, $1,156 million and $1,101 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our consolidated financial statements include the financial position and operating results of those joint ventures in which we have control. For additional information on our unconsolidated joint ventures and percentage ownership thereof see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below. 
Research and Development

We have significant research, development, engineering and product design capabilities. We spent $73 million in fiscal year 2018, $69 million in fiscal year 2017 and $68 million in fiscal year 2016 on company-sponsored research, development and engineering. We employ professional engineers and scientists globally and have additional engineering capabilities through contract arrangements in low-cost countries. We also have advanced technical centers in North America, South America, Europe and Asia Pacific (primarily in India and China). 
Patents and Trademarks

We own or license many United States and foreign patents and patent applications in our engineering and manufacturing operations and other activities. While in the aggregate these patents and licenses are considered important to the operation of our businesses, management does not believe that the loss or termination of any one of them would materially affect a business segment or Meritor as a whole.

Our registered trademarks for Meritor® and the Bull design are important to our business. Other significant trademarks owned by us include Euclid® and Trucktechnic® for aftermarket products.

Substantially all of our U.S.-held intellectual property rights are subject to a first-priority perfected security interest securing our obligations to the lenders under our credit facility. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below. 
Employees

At September 30, 2018, we had approximately 8,600 full-time employees (which includes consolidated joint ventures). At that date, 23 employees in the United States were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Most of our facilities outside of the United States and Canada are unionized. We strive to foster and maintain positive relationships with our hourly and salaried employees.

Environmental Matters

Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have, and will continue to have, an impact on our operations. We record liabilities for environmental issues in the accounting period in which they are considered to be probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. At environmental sites in which more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site, as well as an allocable share of costs related to insolvent parties or unidentified shares. At environmental sites in which we are the only potentially responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation before consideration of recovery from insurers or other third parties.

We have been designated as a potentially responsible party at ten Superfund sites, excluding sites as to which our records disclose no involvement or as to which our liability has been finally determined. These sites include a location in Grenada, Mississippi that was designated as a Superfund site by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in September of 2018. In addition to Superfund sites, various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been asserted against us, alleging violations of federal, state and local environmental protection requirements or seeking remediation of alleged environmental impairments, principally at previously disposed-of properties. We have established reserves for these liabilities when they are considered to be probable and reasonably estimable. See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below for information as to our estimates of the total reasonably possible costs we could incur and the amounts recorded as a liability as of September 30, 2018, and as to changes in environmental accruals during fiscal year 2018.

The process of estimating environmental liabilities is complex and dependent on physical and scientific data at the site, uncertainties as to remedies and technologies to be used, and the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies. The actual amount of costs or damages for which we may be held responsible could materially exceed our current estimates because of uncertainties, including the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties, the success of the remediation and other factors that make it difficult to predict actual costs accurately. However, based on management's assessment, after consulting with Meritor's Chief Legal Officer and with outside advisors who specialize in environmental matters, and subject to the difficulties inherent in estimating these future costs, we believe that our expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, in future periods, new laws and regulations, changes in remediation plans, advances in technology and additional information about the ultimate clean-up remedy could significantly change our estimates. Management cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.
Seasonality; Cyclicality

We may experience seasonal variations in the demand for our products, to the extent OEM vehicle production fluctuates. Historically, for most of our operations, demand has been somewhat lower in the quarters ended September 30 and December 31, when OEM plants may close for summer shutdowns and holiday periods or when there are fewer selling days during the quarter. Our aftermarket business and our operations in India and China generally experience seasonally higher demand in the quarters ending March 31 and June 30.

In addition, the industries in which we operate have been characterized historically by periodic fluctuations in overall demand for trucks, trailers and other specialty vehicles for which we supply products, resulting in corresponding fluctuations in demand for our products. Production and sales of the vehicles for which we supply products generally depend on economic conditions and a variety of other factors that are outside of our control, including freight tonnage, customer spending and preferences, vehicle age, labor relations and regulatory requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors below. Cycles in the major vehicle industry markets of North America and Europe are not necessarily concurrent or related. It is part of our strategy to continue to seek to expand our operations globally to help mitigate the effect of periodic fluctuations in demand of the vehicle industry in one or more particular countries.
See Trends and Uncertainties in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis for estimated commercial truck production volumes for selected original equipment markets based on available sources and management's estimates.
