         We report our operating results in two reportable segments: Paper and Packaging and Distribution. Our Paper and Packaging segment manufactures and sells a wide variety of containerboard, corrugated products and specialty paper for industrial and consumer markets. The Distribution segment, through Victory, a North American distributor of packaging materials, with approximately 60 distribution centers located in the United States, Mexico and Canada, provides packaging materials and related products to a wide variety of customers. For more information about our segments, see Note 18 "Segment Information". 
   General 
         Our Paper and Packaging segment produces containerboard, corrugated products and specialty paper. In 2017, we produced 2.8 million tons, nearly 86 percent of which was sold to third party converters or shipped to our corrugated products manufacturing plants based in the United States, and 14 percent of which was sold to foreign based customers. In 2017, our corrugated products manufacturing plants sold about 912 thousand tons or 14.4 billion square feet ("BSF") of corrugated products in the U.S. Our Paper and Packaging net sales in 2017 totaled $2.4 billion, which was primarily comprised of $1.6 billion of containerboard and corrugated products and $0.7 billion of specialty paper. 
         Our Distribution segment, which operates under the Victory trade name, provides its customers comprehensive packaging solutions and services and distributes corrugated packaging materials and other specialty packaging products, which include stretch film, void fill, carton sealing tape and other specialty tapes. In 2017, our Distribution segment's net sales totaled $1.0 billion, 5 percent of which was sold to customers in Mexico and Canada. 
         The Company's business is affected by cyclical industry conditions and general economic conditions in North America and in other parts of the world where we export containerboard and specialty paper and distribute packaging materials. These conditions affect the prices that we are able to charge for our products and services. Our foreign and export sales may also be affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and trade policies and relations.

   Paper and Packaging Segment 
 


Containerboard 

         Containerboard, consisting of linerboard and corrugated medium, is primarily used to manufacture corrugated containers for packaging products. U.S. demand for corrugated containers and containerboard tends to be driven by industrial production of processed foods, nondurable goods and certain durable goods. 
         The American Forest and Paper Association's ("AF&PA") estimate of the size of the U.S. containerboard market is as follows: 

   
(In millions) | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015 | 
Total U.S. sales | | 33.5 tons | | 32.4 tons | | 32.2 tons | 
U.S. production | | 37.4 tons | | 36.3 tons | | 35.8 tons | 
Imports | | 1.4 tons | | 1.2 tons | | 1.1 tons | 
Exports | | 5.3 tons | | 5.1 tons | | 4.8 tons |

Specialty Paper 


Kraft Paper 

         We produce three general categories of kraft paper:
 

ÂMultiwall paper is used to produce bags for agricultural products, pet food, baking products,
cement and chemicals. We are the only U.S. manufacturer of extensible, high performance multiwall kraft paper. Our FibreShieldÂ® and TEA-KraftÂ® lines of products offer
durability, savings, efficiency and are supported by our exceptional customer and technical service. We also manufacture durable flat multiwall sack paper for a variety of end-use applications. 
ÂSpecialty products have a large variety of uses within coating and laminating applications that
requires a smooth surface. Specialty paper is also used to produce shingle wrap, end caps, roll wrap and dunnage bags. Our specialty paper products are designed to meet the unique needs of a variety
of customers and end uses. We modify a range of specialty paper products for our specialty paper grades, such as sizing, smoothness, porosity, wet strength, pH and others. Our specialty paper products
are manufactured for a variety of converters, including laminators, coaters, insulation manufacturers, agricultural product processors and food product packaging producers. 
ÂLightweight paper is used in a variety of flexible packaging applications that range from
100 percent recycled content for quick-service restaurant carry out bags to 100 percent virgin content for direct contact food packaging. Our lightweight virgin furnished papers are
produced from specifically blended wood chip recipes. These wood chip and pulp recipes are specifically designed to develop paper properties important for a variety of specialty packaging end uses and
coating base paper applications. Our recycled content light weight papers are made in a wide variety of basis weights and percentages of recycled fiber content, and are valued for their cleanliness,
strength, sustainability and end-use possibilities. The most recently developed product line, FibreGreenÂ®, is composed of old corrugated containers ("OCC") processed in our
state-of-the-art OCC facility and is available in a wide range of basis weights. FibreGreenÂ® meets the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's requirements for direct food contact and is
certified by the Sustainable Forestry InitiativeÂ®. 

         The AF&PA's estimate of the size of the U.S. kraft paper market is as follows: 

   
(In millions) | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015 | 
Total U.S. sales | | 1.81 tons | | 1.80 tons | | 1.58 tons | 
U.S. operating rates | | 89 | % | 93 | % | 90 | %

  Saturating Kraft 
         Saturating kraft is used in multiple industries around the world, including construction, electronics manufacturing and furniture manufacturing. The major end-use is thin high pressure laminates ("HPL"), used to create decorative surfaces such as kitchen and bath countertops, home and office furniture and flooring. Within the HPL market there is a growing and distinct HPL segment manufacturing and selling a much thicker product called compact laminates used as surfacing products such as exterior cladding, partitions and doors. In Asia, there is significant use of saturating kraft product for the manufacturing of printed circuit boards and copper clad laminates and there is also a growing use for thin HPL in decorative surfaces. We are not aware of any published data reporting the size of the saturating kraft market. Barriers to entry for producing high quality saturating kraft are high as it is a technically difficult grade of paper to produce.

Unbleached Folding Carton Board 

         Unbleached folding carton board is a low density virgin fiber board. Applications are widely spread throughout end uses in the general folding carton segment of the paperboard packaging market. This product can replace the use of more expensive coated recycled board, coated natural kraft board and solid bleached sulfate board, which are currently much larger markets. There is no published data we are aware of reporting the size of the unbleached, uncoated folding carton market. 
   Distribution Segment 
         The Distribution segment, through Victory's operations, works with customers to improve and facilitate the various aspects of packaging and distribution, including packaging design, creation, storage, delivery and management. Based in Houston, TX, Victory has approximately 60 warehouses and distribution facilities, with the majority in the United States, 3 in Canada and 15 in Mexico. Nationwide, Victory is one of the largest distributors specializing in packaging solutions for its customers on a national scale. Victory also oversees local packaging and distribution for regional customers. The Distribution segment's national network includes approximately 6.4 million square feet of warehouse space and approximately 230 delivery vehicles. 
         Victory distributes corrugated and other specialty packaging products, which include stretch film, void fill, carton sealing tape and other specialty tapes. 
   Manufacturing 
         We operate four paper mills, three in the Southeastern region and one in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. In 2017, we produced 2.8 million tons of containerboard and specialty paper at our mills in North Charleston, South Carolina; Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina; Cowpens, South Carolina; and Longview, Washington. Our mills generally operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Fiber used to make containerboard and specialty paper is produced from a combination of locally sourced roundwood and woodchips. After the wood is debarked and chipped, the chips are loaded into digesters for cooking. Woodchips, chemicals and steam are mixed in the digester to produce softwood pulp. Hardwood pulp is produced in a similar fashion at North Charleston primarily for the production of DuraSorbÂ® saturating kraft and KraftpakÂ® and at Longview primarily for the production of corrugated medium. The pulp is screened and washed through a series of washers and then stored prior to the paper making process. OCC is used to make recycled containerboard at our Cowpens mill and is a component of certain grades of kraft paper and containerboard at our Longview mill. The Company processes pulp using eleven paper machines at our facilities. Management monitors productivity on a real-time basis with on-line reporting tools that track production values versus targets. Overall equipment efficiency is also monitored daily through production reporting systems. 
         As of December 31, 2017, we operated 23 corrugated products manufacturing plants, comprised of 12 box plants, nine sheet plants and two sheet feeder plants. Box plants operate as combining operations that manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated products. Sheet feeder plants have a corrugator machine and manufacture corrugated sheets, which are shipped to sheet or box plants. Sheet plants have various machines that convert corrugated sheets, purchased either from our operations or third parties, into finished corrugated products. Plants with a corrugating machine have total capacity of approximately 19 BSF. 
         Our corrugated products manufacturing plants operate in 15 states in the U.S., with no manufacturing facilities outside of the continental U.S. Each plant, for the most part, serves a market radius that typically averages 200 miles. Our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants, which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities, such as small volume and quick turnaround items. 
 8

           We produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging. We also have multi-color printing capabilities to make high-impact graphics boxes and displays that offer customers such as consumer products companies more attractive packaging. 
         We execute containerboard buy/sell arrangements with other containerboard manufacturers. 
   Supply Chain 
         Containerboard and specialty paper produced in our paper mills is shipped by rail or truck to customers in the U.S. and is shipped by truck to nearby ports and then by ocean vessel to our export customers. Domestic rail shipments represent about 48 percent of the tons shipped and the remaining 52 percent is shipped by truck. 
         Our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our customers demand for timely service. We use a combination of a dedicated third-party fleet and our own trucks. 
         The majority of Victory's products in the U.S. and Canada are delivered directly from Victory's network of distribution and fulfillment facilities using its fleet of approximately 230 delivery vehicles. In Mexico, delivery is outsourced to third party logistics companies. Our distribution and fulfillment facilities offer a range of delivery options depending on the customer's needs and preferences. The strategic placement of the distribution and fulfillment facilities also allows for delivery of special or "rush" orders to many customers. 
   Sales and Marketing 
         Our containerboard and specialty paper marketing strategy is to sell our products to third-party converters and manufacturers of industrial and consumer packaging products. We seek to meet the quality and service needs of the customers of our corrugated operations at the most efficient cost, while balancing those needs against the demands of our containerboard customers. 
         We sell our products directly to end users and converters, as well as through sales agents. Our sales groups are responsible for the sale of these products to third party converters in the U.S. Sales to export markets are managed by personnel who are based in Europe and Asia. 
         Our corrugated and packaging products and services are sold through an internal sales and marketing organization. We have sales representatives and sales managers who serve local and regional accounts. We also have corporate account managers who serve large national accounts at multiple customer locations. Our corrugated operations focus on supplying both high-volume commodity products and specialized packaging with high-value graphics. 
   Customers and Products 
         Our Paper and Packaging segment has over 3,000 U.S.-based and over 200 export customers, and our Distribution segment has approximately 6,300 active customers. 
         Containerboard is sold to domestic and foreign converters in the corrugated packaging industry and to other converters for a variety of uses including laminated tier sheets and wrapping material, among others. Historically, our focus is on independent converters who do not have their own mill systems or converters who otherwise commonly purchase containerboard in the open market. 
         Corrugated products are sold primarily to regional and local accounts, which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations. We have a select number of national accounts, or those customers with a national presence. These national customers typically purchase corrugated products from several of our box plants throughout the United States. 
 9

           Specialty paper is sold to both domestic and export converters who produce multiwall bags for food grade agricultural products, pet food, cement and chemicals, grocery bags and specialty conversion products, such as wrapping paper products, dunnage bags and roll wrap. 
         Our saturating kraft paper, sold under the trade name DurasorbÂ®, has a customer base split among three geographic regions: the Americas; Europe; and Asia. Approximately 88 percent of our DurasorbÂ® sales are exports to customers in Europe, Latin America and Asia where growth opportunities are favorable. KapStone, or its predecessor, has done business with many of these customers for well over 40 years. Some customers have consolidated to form a greater presence in their end-use markets. Customer consolidation is particularly evident in North America and is in the early phase in Europe. In Asia, there are numerous players and it is a highly fragmented market making entry difficult for some companies that do not have a presence in the region. KapStone has acquired a leadership position with our DurasorbÂ® product through knowledge of our markets and understanding the technical needs of our customers' manufacturing processes and the demanding requirements of their products. 
         Our unbleached folding carton board sold under the KraftpakÂ® trade name has a customer base consisting primarily of integrated and independent converters in the folding carton industry. Our unbleached folding carton board product is a unique, low-density virgin fiber board. KapStone believes that the best growth opportunities for Kraftpak are in consumer brands that are changing their images to promote environmental friendliness and sustainability. Kraftpak and similar products replace the use of coated recycled board, coated natural kraft board and solid bleached sulfate board, which are currently much larger markets. 
         Victory's customer base includes local, regional and national accounts across a wide range of industries and size and through a variety of means ranging from multi-year supply agreements to transactional sales. Besides offering material-neutral design capabilities and high levels of distribution services, Victory also specializes in fulfillment, kitting and contract packaging services. 
         Victory has valuable, multi-year, long-term supply agreements with many of its largest customers that set forth the terms and conditions of sale, including product pricing. Generally, customers are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products under these agreements and can place orders on an individual purchase order basis. However, Victory enters into negotiated supply agreements with certain customers, which include commitments to inventory held in its distribution facilities. Victory's working capital needs generally reflect the need to carry significant amounts of inventory in its distribution and fulfillment facilities to meet delivery requirements of its distribution and fulfillment customers, as well as significant accounts receivable balances. As is typical in this industry, Victory's customers often do not pay upon receipt, but are offered terms which are heavily dependent on the specific circumstances of the sale. 
         No customer accounts for more than 10 percent of consolidated net sales. Our business is not dependent upon a single customer or upon a small number of major customers. 
   Seasonality and Backlog 
         In our Paper and Packaging segment, demand for our major product lines is relatively constant throughout the year, and seasonal fluctuations in marketing, production, shipments and inventories are not significant. Seasonal fluctuations are largely driven by the agricultural market within the western United States. Backlogs are a factor in the industry, as they allow paper mills to run more efficiently. However, most orders are placed for delivery within 30 days. 
         In our Distribution segment, operating results are subject to some seasonal influences that are not material to the consolidated results of the Company. Historically, our highest shipments occur during the second and third quarters, while our lowest shipments occur during the first quarter. Within the 
 10

   Distribution segment, shipments for the first quarter are typically less than shipments for the fourth quarter of the preceding year. 
   Suppliers and Major Raw Materials Used 
   Fiber 
         Fiber is the single largest cost in the manufacture of containerboard and specialty paper. KapStone consumes both wood fiber and recycled fiber in its paper mills. Our paper mills in North Charleston and Roanoke Rapids use 100 percent virgin fiber. The fiber needs in 2017 of our Longview, Washington mill were supplied by approximately 70 percent of virgin fiber. Fiber used to make containerboard and specialty paper is produced from a combination of locally sourced roundwood and woodchips. We rely on supply agreements and open-market purchases to supply these mills with roundwood and wood chips. Fiber resources are generally available within proximity to these mills and we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining our mill fiber needs. 
         In 2017, the Company began operating two wood chipping facilities managed by a third party for use at the North Charleston and Roanoke Rapids paper mills. 
   Recycled Fiber 
         The fiber consumption in our mill in Cowpens, South Carolina consists 100 percent of recycled fiber or OCC. We obtain OCC pursuant to certain supply agreements and in open market purchases from suppliers within proximity to the Cowpens Mill. OCC has historically exhibited significant price volatility. The Cowpens mill has not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining OCC. Approximately 30 percent of the fiber needs at our Longview, WA mill are recycled. 
 Containerboard 
         Our corrugated manufacturing plants consume containerboard produced at our mills or from third parties and through buy/sell arrangements. We also use third-party mills which are closer to our corrugated manufacturing plants to realize freight savings. Containerboard, which includes both linerboard and corrugating medium, is the principal raw material used to manufacture corrugated products. Linerboard is used as the inner and outer facings, or liners, of corrugated products. Corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to linerboard in corrugated plants to produce corrugated sheets. The sheets are subsequently printed, cut, folded and glued to produce corrugated products. 
 Distributed Products 
         Victory purchases products from a number of suppliers, mainly in the U.S. Victory's suppliers consist of large paper and packaging corporations, regional corrugated and sheet plants and non-corrugated corporations. Upon being acquired by KapStone, Victory increased its purchases from KapStone's corrugated products manufacturing plants. Suppliers are selected based on customer demand for the product and a supplier's total service, cost and product quality offering. 
         The product sourcing is designed to ensure that Victory is able to offer consistent but varied product selections and market competitive pricing across the enterprise while maintaining the ability to service localized market requirements. Our procurement program is also focused on replenishment, which includes purchase order placement and managing the total cost of inventory by improving the number of days inventory is on hand, negotiating favorable payment terms and maintaining vendor-owned and vendor-managed programs. As a large purchaser of packaging material, we can qualify for volume allowances with some suppliers and can realize significant economies of scale. We in turn enter into incentive agreements with certain of our largest customers, which are generally based on sales to these customers. 
 11

     Energy 
         Energy at the paper mills is obtained through purchased electricity or through various fuels, which are converted to steam or electricity on-site. Fuel sources include coal, purchased biomass fuel, natural gas, oil, bark, sawdust and by-products of the manufacturing and pulping process, including black liquor. These fuels are burned in boilers to produce steam. Steam turbine generators are used to produce electricity. To reduce our mill energy cost, we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high level of purchased fuel flexibility. In recent history, fuel oil has exhibited higher costs per thermal unit and more price volatility than natural gas and coal. KapStone took advantage of declining coal prices plus additional short-term opportunities in declining natural gas prices to balance the utilization of both gas and coal in 2017 with other fuels at our Charleston and Roanoke Rapids mills. A substantial portion of our Longview mill electricity requirements are satisfied by hydroelectric power, which has relatively stable pricing. 
         In 2017, we purchased coal under one contract. Contracts for the purchase of natural gas at fixed prices have been layered in for various terms and quantities, with the shortest terms ending in 2019 and the longest terms ending in 2022. 
         KapStone's corrugated products manufacturing plants primarily use boilers that produce steam which is used in the product manufacturing process. The majority of these boilers burn natural gas, although some also have the ability to burn fuel oil. Sheet plants use electricity for their main source of power. 
         Volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our Distribution segment, as it affects the prices paid by us for products as well as the costs incurred to deliver products to our distribution and fulfillment customers. Victory purchases diesel fuel under contracts tied to market prices for diesel and does not engage in any material forward or hedging fuel contracts.

         The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive and comprised of many participants. We face significant competitors, including large, vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller companies. 
         Our principal competitors with respect to sales of our containerboard and specialty paper are a number of large, diversified paper and packaging corporations, including International Paper Company, Georgia-Pacific (owned by Koch Industries, Inc.), WestRock Company and Packaging Corporation of America, all of which have greater financial resources than we do. We also compete with other regional manufacturers of these products. Our specialty paper products (other than our DurasorbÂ® and KraftpakÂ® products) are each generally considered a commodity-type product that can be purchased from numerous suppliers and competition is based primarily on price, product specification, service and quality. 
         Corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate themselves through innovation, quality, service and product design. We compete for both local and national account business, and we compete against producers of other types of packaging products. On a national level, our primary competitors include International Paper Company, Georgia-Pacific (owned by Koch Industries, Inc.), WestRock Company and Packaging Corporation of America. However, with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts, we also compete with the smaller, independent converters. 
         The packaging distribution industry is highly competitive, with numerous regional and local competitors, and is a mature industry characterized by slowing growth. Victory's principal competitors include regional and local distributors, national and regional manufacturers and independent brokers. Most of these competitors generally offer a wide range of products at prices comparable to those Victory offers, though at varying service levels. On a national level, our primary competitors include

   International Paper Company, Georgia-Pacific (owned by Koch Industries, Inc.), WestRock Company, Veritiv and Packaging Corporation of America. However, with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts, we also compete with the smaller, independent distribution companies. Additionally, new competition could arise from non-traditional sources, group purchasing organizations, e-commerce, discount wholesalers or consolidation among competitors. We believe that Victory offers the full range of services required to effectively compete, but if new competitive sources appear it may result in margin erosion or make it more difficult to attract and retain customers. 
   Intellectual Property 
         The Company owns patents, licenses, trademarks and trade names on products. However, we do not believe that our intellectual property is material to our business and the loss of any or our intellectual property rights would not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. 
 Employees 
         As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 6,400 employees. Of these, approximately 2,000 employees are salaried and 4,400 are hourly. Approximately 2,400 of our hourly employees are represented by unions. The majority of our unionized employees are represented by either the United Steel Workers or the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers. 
         Currently, there is a collective bargaining agreement in effect with respect to approximately 630 employees at the Longview paper mill through May 2024, approximately 560 employees at the North Charleston paper mill through June 2025 and approximately 310 employees at the Roanoke Rapids paper mill through August 2020. 
   Environmental Matters 
         Compliance with environmental requirements is a significant factor in our business operations. We commit substantial resources to maintaining environmental compliance and managing environmental risk. We are subject to, and must comply with, a variety of foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws, particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste disposal, and cleanup of contaminated soil, groundwater or rivers. The most significant of these U.S. laws affecting us are: 


1.Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act;
2.Clean
Water Act;
3.Clean
Air Act;
4.The
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know-Act;
5.Toxic
Substance Control Act; and
6.Safe
Drinking Water Act. 

         We believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws and regulations. We work diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and do not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our business or financial condition. 
         We do not believe that any ongoing remedial projects are material in nature.

           The Company's subsidiary, Longview is a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") with respect to the Lower Duwamish Waterway Superfund Site in the State of Washington (the "Site"). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") asserts that the Site is contaminated as a result of discharges from various businesses and government entities located along the Lower Duwamish Waterway, including a corrugated converting plant owned and operated by Longview. In November 2014, the EPA issued a Record of Decision ("ROD") for the Site. The ROD includes a selected remedy for the Site. In the ROD, EPA states that the total estimated net present value costs (discounted at 2.3 percent) for the selected remedy are $342 million, although many uncertainties remain that could result in increased remedial costs. This estimate does not include actual costs already incurred to date for remedial investigation and feasibility studies or potential natural resource damage claims by parties allegedly affected by the contamination at the Site. The Company has received notice from the Elliot Bay Trustee Council regarding the Company's potential liability for natural resource damages arising from the Site. Neither the Company nor Longview has received a specific monetary demand regarding its potential liability for the Site. In addition, Longview is a participant with approximately 45 other potentially responsible parties in a non-judicial allocation process with respect to the Site. Pursuant to the non-judicial allocation process, Longview and other participating parties will seek to allocate certain costs, including but not limited to the costs necessary to perform the work under the ROD. The non-judicial allocation process is not scheduled to be completed until 2020. Based upon the information available to the Company at this time, the Company cannot reasonably estimate its potential liability for this Site, including any liability for the current or any future third-party claims associated with the Site. 
         We could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of claims by third parties for civil damages, including liability for personal injury or property damage, arising from releases of hazardous substances or contamination. Except as described above, we are not aware of any material claims of this type currently pending against us. 
         While legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed from time to time over the past several years at the federal level, there is no indication of any near term action. In the absence of broad legislation, the EPA has moved forward with an increasing array of regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions in certain industrial sectors under existing Clean Air Act programs. The result of a broader regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs, or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities, which may be material. However, climate change regulations, possible future legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy continues to be encouraged. We currently generate a significant portion of our power requirements for our mills using bark, black liquor and other biomass as fuel, which are derived from renewable resources. While we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives, it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation or regulation will be and how our business and industry will be affected. 
         In 2004, EPA published the Boiler MACT regulations, establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers. These regulations have been subject to a series of legal challenges and have been promulgated and / or amended by EPA several times since the initial rules were published. A final reconsidered regulation was issued in January 2013 but legal challenges were filed. In July 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled on consolidated cases challenging the Boiler MACT regulations. The court vacated emission limits for certain subcategories of solid fuel boilers, and remanded other issues to the EPA for further explanation. In December 2016, in response to a request by EPA, the court changed its remedy for the vacated standards and remanded them to EPA instead. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the matter in June 2017, but legal proceedings continue. We cannot currently predict with certainty how

   these recent decisions will impact our existing Boiler MACT compliance or whether our operating costs will increase in order to comply with any revised Boiler MACT regulations. All of our mills currently subject to federal Boiler MACT regulations have demonstrated compliance with the current standards and requirements. 
         In addition to Boiler MACT and greenhouse gas standards, the EPA has recently finalized a number of other environmental rules, which may impact the pulp and paper industry. The EPA also is revising existing environmental standards and developing several new rules that may apply to the industry in the future. We cannot currently predict with certainty how any future changes in environmental laws and regulations (or their interpretation) and/or enforcement practices will affect our business; however, it is possible that our compliance, capital expenditure requirements and operating costs could increase materially. 
         In January 2017, the Company received a letter from the state of Washington Department of Ecology ("WDOE") contending that the Company is, along with several other companies, responsible for investigation and cleanup of an allegedly contaminated site where the named companies, including Longview, may store or have stored petroleum products. The letter concerns the possible release of petroleum products into the environment. In 1998, Longview (before it was acquired by the Company) and certain other companies who owned or operated underground storage tanks and pipes entered into an agreement for investigating and remediating the area independently of (but in consultation with) the WDOE. Upon expiration of the 1998 agreement, groundwater monitoring continued. In June 2017, the WDOE further notified the Company that WDOE determined Longview is a potentially liable party related to the release or threatened release of petroleum at the site. The Company has responded to the notices and has been engaged in discussions with the WDOE and other potentially liable parties. Based upon the information available to the Company at this time, the Company cannot reasonably estimate its potential liability for this matter.
