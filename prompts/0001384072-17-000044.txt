ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
We are a publicly traded limited liability company focused on the acquisition and development of mature, long-lived oil and natural gas properties in the United States. Our primary business objective is to generate stable cash flows allowing us to resume making monthly cash distributions to our unitholders and, over time, increase our monthly cash distributions through the acquisition of additional mature, long-lived oil and natural gas properties. Through our operating subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2016, we own properties and oil and natural gas reserves primarily located in ten operating basins:

• | the Green River Basin in Wyoming;


• | the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico;


• | the Piceance Basin in Colorado;


• | the Gulf Coast Basin in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama;


• | the Arkoma Basin in Arkansas and Oklahoma;


• | the Big Horn Basin in Wyoming and Montana;


• | the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana;


• | the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and North Texas;


• | the Wind River Basin in Wyoming; and


• | the Powder River Basin in Wyoming.

We were formed in October 2006 and completed our initial public offering in October 2007. For financial information regarding Vanguard, please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report. 
On February 3, 2017, the Company announced that it received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of NASDAQ notifying the Company that as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases (defined below), and in accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b) and IM-5101-1, NASDAQ has determined that its common units representing limited liability company interests, our 7.875% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the “Series A Preferred Units”), our 7.625% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the “Series B Preferred Units”) and our Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the “Series C Preferred Units and, together with the Series A Preferred Units and Series B Preferred Units, the “Preferred Units”) would be delisted from The NASDAQ Stock Market. Accordingly, the trading of the common units and Preferred Units was suspended on February 13, 2017 and the common units and Preferred Units were removed from listing and registration on The NASDAQ Global Select Market.
Our common units, Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and Series C Preferred Units commenced quotation on the OTC Pink Sheets on February 13, 2017 under the symbols VNRSQ, VNRAQ, VNGBQ and VNRCQ, respectively.

Organizational Structure
The following diagram depicts our organizational structure as of March 15, 2017:
Bankruptcy Proceedings under Chapter 11
Commencement of Bankruptcy Cases 
On February 1, 2017, the Company and certain subsidiaries (such subsidiaries, together with the Company, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for relief (collectively, the “Petitions” and, the cases commenced thereby, the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Debtors have filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to jointly administer the Chapter 11 Cases under the caption “In re: Vanguard Natural Resources, LLC, et al.” 
The subsidiary Debtors in the Chapter 11 Cases are VNRF; VNG; VO; VNRH; ECFP; ERAC; ERAC II; ERUD; ERUD II; ERAP; ERAP II; EAC; and EOC.
No trustee has been appointed and the Company will continue to manage itself and its affiliates and operate their businesses as “debtors-in-possession” subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The Company expects to continue its operations without interruption during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. To assure ordinary course operations, the Debtors secured orders from the Bankruptcy Court approving a variety of “first day” motions, including motions that authorize the Debtors to maintain their existing cash management system, to secure debtor-in-possession financing and other customary relief. These motions are designed primarily to minimize the effect of bankruptcy on the Company’s operations, customers and employees.

Restructuring Support Agreement 
Prior to the filing of the Petitions, on February 1, 2017, the Debtors entered into a restructuring support agreement (the “Restructuring Support Agreement”) with (i) certain holders (the “Consenting 2020 Noteholders”) constituting approximately 52% of the 7.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “Senior Notes due 2020”); (ii) certain holders (the “Consenting 2019 Noteholders and, together with the Consenting 2020 Noteholders, the “Consenting Senior Noteholders) constituting approximately 10% of the 8.375% Senior Notes due 2019 (the “Senior Notes due 2019,” and all claims arising under or in connection with the Senior Notes due 2020 and Senior Notes due 2019, the “Senior Note Claims”); and (iii) certain holders (the “Consenting Second Lien Noteholders” and, together with the Consenting Senior Noteholders, the “Restructuring Support Parties”) constituting approximately 92% of the 7.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2023 (the “Second Lien Notes,” and all claims and obligations arising under or in connection with the Second Lien Notes, the “Second Lien Note Claims”). 
The Restructuring Support Agreement sets forth, subject to certain conditions, the commitment of the Debtors and the Restructuring Support Parties to support a comprehensive restructuring of the Debtors’ long-term debt (the “Restructuring Transactions”). The Restructuring Transactions will be effectuated through one or more plans of reorganization (the “Plan”) to be filed in the Chapter 11 Cases. 
The Restructuring Transactions will be financed by (i) use of cash collateral, (ii) the proposed DIP Credit Agreement (as described below), (iii) a fully committed $19.25 million equity investment (the “Second Lien Investment”) by the Consenting Second Lien Noteholders and (iv) a $255.75 million rights offering (the “Senior Note Rights Offering”) that is fully backstopped by the Consenting Senior Noteholders.
Certain principal terms of the Plan are outlined below: 

• | Allowed claims (“First Lien Claims”) under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 30, 2011 (as amended from time to time, the “Reserve-Based Credit Facility”) will be paid down with $275.0 million in cash from the proceeds of the Senior Note Rights Offering and Second Lien Investment and may be paid down further with proceeds from non-core asset sales or other available cash. The remaining First Lien Claims will participate in a new Company $1.1 billion reserve-based lending facility (the “New Facility”) on terms substantially the same as the Reserve-Based Credit Facility and provided by some or all of the lenders under the Reserve-Based Credit Facility.


• | Allowed Second Lien Claims will receive new notes in the current principal amount of approximately $75.6 million, which shall be substantially similar to the current Second Lien Notes but providing a 12-month later maturity and a 200 basis point increase to the interest rate.


• | Each holder of an allowed Senior Note Claim shall receive (a) its pro rata share of 97% of the ownership interests in the reorganized Company (the “New Equity Interests”) and (b) the opportunity to participate in the Senior Note Rights Offering.


• | If the Plan is accepted by the classes of general unsecured claims and holders of the Preferred Units, holders of the Preferred Units will receive their pro rata share of (a) 3% of the New Equity Interests and (b) three-year warrants for 3% of the New Equity Interests.


• | The Plan will provide for the $255.75 million Senior Note Rights Offering to holders of Senior Note Claims to purchase New Equity Interests at an agreed discount. Certain holders of the Senior Note Claims will execute a backstop commitment agreement whereby they will agree to fully backstop the Senior Note Rights Offering.


• | The Plan will provide for the Second Lien Investors to purchase $19.25 million in New Equity Interests at a 25% discount to the Company’s total enterprise value.

The Plan will provide for the establishment of a customary management incentive plan at the Company under which 10% of the New Equity Interests will be reserved for grants made from time to time to the officers and other key employees of the respective reorganized entities. The Plan will provide for releases of specified claims held by the Debtors, the Restructuring Support Parties, and certain other specified parties against one another and for customary exculpations and injunctions. 
The Restructuring Support Agreement obligates the Debtors and the Restructuring Support Parties to, among other things, support and not interfere with consummation of the Restructuring Transactions and, as to the Restructuring Support Parties, vote their claims in favor of the Plan. The Restructuring Support Agreement may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain 
4

events, including the failure to meet specified milestones relating to the filing, confirmation, and consummation of the Plan, among other requirements, and in the event of certain breaches by the parties under the Restructuring Support Agreement. The Restructuring Support Agreement is subject to termination if the effective date of the Plan has not occurred within 150 days of the filing of the Petitions. There can be no assurances that the Restructuring Transactions will be consummated. 
The Administrative Agent (as defined in the Restructuring Agreement) under the Reserve-Based Credit Facility and the financial institutions party thereto (the “First Lien Lenders”) have not executed the Restructuring Support Agreement, and the New Facility will be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and First Lien Lenders in all respects. The Company and the Restructuring Support Parties expect to engage with the First Lien Lenders in an effort to agree upon mutually acceptable terms of the New Facility.
Debtor-in-Possession Financing
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, on February 1, 2017, the Debtors filed a motion (the “DIP Motion”) seeking, among other things, interim and final approval of the Debtors’ use of cash collateral and debtor-in-possession financing on terms and conditions set forth in a proposed Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement (the “DIP Credit Agreement”) among VNG (the “DIP Borrower”), the financial institutions or other entities from time to time parties thereto, as lenders, Citibank N.A., as administrative agent (the “DIP Agent”) and as issuing bank. The initial lenders under the DIP Credit Agreement include lenders under the Company’s existing first-lien credit agreement or the affiliates of such lenders. The proposed DIP Credit Agreement, if approved by the Bankruptcy Court, contains the following terms: 

• | a revolving credit facility in the aggregate amount of up to $50.0 million, and $15.0 million available on an interim basis;


• | proceeds of the DIP Credit Agreement may be used by the DIP Borrower to (i) pay certain costs and expenses related to the Chapter 11 Cases, (ii) make payments provided for in the DIP Motion, including in respect of certain “adequate protection” obligations and (iii) fund working capital needs, capital improvements and other general corporate purposes of the DIP Borrower and its subsidiaries, in all cases subject to the terms of the DIP Credit Agreement and applicable orders of the Bankruptcy Court;


• | the maturity date of the DIP Credit Agreement is expected to be the earliest to occur of November 1, 2017, forty-five days following the date of the interim order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the DIP Facility on an interim basis, if the Bankruptcy Court has not entered the final order on or prior to such date, or the effective date of a plan of reorganization in the Chapter 11 Cases. In addition, the maturity date may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in the DIP Credit Agreement;


• | interest will accrue at a rate per year equal to the LIBOR rate plus 5.50%;


• | in addition to fees to be paid to the DIP Agent, the DIP Borrower is required to pay to the DIP Agent for the account of the lenders under the DIP Credit Agreement, an unused commitment fee equal to 1.0% of the daily average of each lender’s unused commitment under the DIP Credit Agreement, which is payable in arrears on the last day of each calendar month and on the termination date for the facility for any period for which the unused commitment fee has not previously been paid;


• | the obligations and liabilities of the DIP Borrower and its subsidiaries owed to the DIP Agent and lenders under the DIP Credit Agreement and related loan documents will be entitled to joint and several super-priority administrative expense claims against each of the DIP Borrower and its subsidiaries in their respective Chapter 11 Cases subject to limited exceptions provided for in the DIP Motion, and will be secured by (i) a first priority, priming security interest and lien on all encumbered property of the DIP Borrower and its subsidiaries, subject to limited exceptions provided for in the DIP Motion, (ii) a first priority security interest and lien on all unencumbered property of the DIP Borrower and its subsidiaries, subject to limited exceptions provided for in the DIP Motion and (iii) a junior security interest and lien on all property of the DIP Borrower and its subsidiaries that is subject to (a) a valid, perfected and non-avoidable lien as of the petition date (other than the first priority and second priority prepetition liens) or (b) a valid and non-avoidable lien that is perfected subsequent to the petition date, in each case subject to limited exceptions provided for in the DIP Motion;


• | the sum of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of the loan parties and undrawn funds under the DIP Credit Agreement shall not be less than $25.0 million at any time; and

5


• | the DIP Credit Agreement is subject to customary covenants, prepayment events, events of default and other provisions.

The DIP Credit Agreement is subject to final approval by the Bankruptcy Court, which has not been obtained at this time. The Debtors anticipate closing the DIP Credit Agreement promptly following final approval by the Bankruptcy Court of the DIP Motion.
Acceleration of Debt Obligations
The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases described above is an event of default that accelerated the Debtors’ obligations under the following debt instruments (the “Debt Instruments”). Any efforts to enforce such obligations under the Debt Documents are stayed automatically as a result of the filing of the Petitions and the holders’ rights of enforcement in respect of the Debt Documents are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

• | $1.25 billion in unpaid principal and approximately $0.2 million of undrawn letters of credit, plus interest, fees, and other expenses arising under or in connection with the Reserve-Based Credit Facility.


• | $51.12 million in unpaid principal, plus interest, fees, and other expenses, arising under or in connection with the Senior Notes due 2019 issued pursuant to that certain Indenture, dated as of May 27, 2011, as amended, by and among the Eagle Rock Energy Partners, L.P., Eagle Rock Energy Finance Corp., the guarantors named therein, and U.S. Bank, National Association, as indenture trustee. VO became the issuer of the Senior Notes due 2019 pursuant to the Fourth Supplemental Indenture effective as of October 8, 2015, among VO, the Subsidiary Guarantors named therein, as guarantors and U.S. Bank, National Association. Wilmington Trust, National Association, is the successor indenture trustee to the Senior Notes due 2019.


• | $381.83 million in unpaid principal, plus interest, fees, and other expenses, arising in connection with the Senior Notes due 2020 issued pursuant to that certain Indenture, dated as of April 4, 2012, among the Company and VNRF, as issuers, the Subsidiary Guarantors named therein, as guarantors, and U.S. Bank, National Association, as trustee. UMB Bank, N.A., is the successor indenture trustee to the Senior Notes due 2020.


• | $75.63 million in unpaid principal, plus interest, fees, and other expenses, arising in connection with the Second Lien Notes issued pursuant to that certain Indenture, dated as of February 10, 2016, among the Company and VNRF, as issuers, the Subsidiary Guarantors named therein, as guarantors, and U.S. Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Delaware Trust Company is the successor indenture trustee to the Second Lien Notes.

Delisting from NASDAQ
On February 3, 2017, the Company announced that it received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of NASDAQ notifying the Company that as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, and in accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b) and IM-5101-1, NASDAQ has determined that the Company’s common units and Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units, and Series C Preferred Units would be delisted from The NASDAQ Stock Market. Accordingly, the trading of the common units and Preferred units was suspended on February 13, 2017 and the common units and Preferred Units were removed from listing and registration on The NASDAQ Global Select Market. 
On February 13, 2017, the Company’s common units began trading on the OTC Pink. The OTC Pink is a significantly more limited market than NASDAQ, and the quotation of the Company’s common units and Preferred Units on the OTC Pink may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential unitholders to trade units and could further depress the trading price of the Company’s common units and Preferred Units. There can be no assurance that any public market for the Company’s units will exist in the future or that the Company or its successor will be able to relist its units on a national securities exchange.
Proved Reserves
Our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were 1,363.2 Bcfe, of which approximately 19% were oil reserves, 65% were natural gas reserves and 16% were NGLs reserves. All of our estimated proved reserves were classified as proved developed. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has removed all PUD reserves from its total proved reserve estimate due to uncertainty regarding the availability of capital that would be required to develop the PUD reserves. At December 31, 2016, estimated future cash inflows from estimated future production of proved reserves were computed using the average oil, 
6

natural gas and NGLs price based upon the 12-month average price of $42.60 per barrel of crude oil, $2.47 per MMBtu for natural gas, and $13.43 per barrel of NGLs.
At December 31, 2016, we owned working interests in 12,589 gross (4,444 net) productive wells. Our operated wells accounted for approximately 65% of our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016. Our average net daily production was 432,676 Mcfe/day for the year ended December 31, 2016 and was 388,984 Mcfe/day for the fourth quarter of 2016. Our average proved reserves-to-production ratio, or average reserve life, is approximately ten years based on our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 and our fourth quarter 2016 annualized production. 
Business Strategies
Our primary business objective is to generate stable cash flows to allow us to resume making monthly cash distributions to our unitholders, and over the long-term to increase the amount of our future distributions by executing the following business strategies:

• | Replace reserves and/or production either through the development of our extensive inventory of undeveloped locations or make accretive acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties in the known producing basins of the continental United States characterized by a high percentage of producing reserves, long-life, stable production and step-out development opportunities;


• | Maintain a capital structure which affords financial flexibility for opportunistic acquisitions; and


• | Use hedging strategies to reduce the volatility in our revenues resulting from changes in oil, natural gas and NGLs prices.

Properties

As of December 31, 2016, through certain of our subsidiaries, we own interests in oil and natural gas properties located in ten operating basins. The following table presents the production for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the estimated proved developed reserves for each operating area:

The following is a description of our properties by operating basin: 
Green River Basin Properties
Our Green River Basin properties are comprised of assets in the Pinedale and Jonah fields of southwestern Wyoming. Production in the Green River Basin is dominated by natural gas and NGLs from tight sands formations. The Pinedale field lies at depths anywhere between 11,000 to 14,000 feet with similar depths in the adjacent Jonah field. Additionally, we have Green 
7

River Basin properties located in the Hay Reservoir, Great Divide, Siberia Ridge, Wamsutter, Echo Springs and Standard Draw fields in southwestern Wyoming. These gas/condensate fields produce from stacked cretaceous aged tight sandstones within the Lewis and Almond/Mesaverde intervals between 8,000 and 12,000 feet deep. Our properties located in south central Wyoming in the Sierra Madre field produce predominately oil from fractured cretaceous aged Niobrara limestone (between 5,000 and 6,000 feet) and conventional Shannon sandstone (between 3,500 and 4,000 feet). As of December 31, 2016, our Green River Basin properties consisted of 126,420 gross (35,170 net) leasehold acres. During 2016, the Green River Basin properties produced approximately 46,111 MMcfe of which 89% was natural gas. At December 31, 2016, the properties had total proved reserves of approximately 318,441 MMcfe or 23% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 87% were natural gas.
Permian Basin Properties
The Permian Basin is one of the largest and most prolific oil and natural gas producing basins in the United States extending over West Texas and southeast New Mexico. The Permian Basin is characterized by oil and natural gas fields with long production histories and multiple producing formations. Our Permian Basin properties are located in several counties which extend from Eddy County, New Mexico to Ellis County, Texas and encompass hundreds of fields with multiple producing intervals. The majority of our producing wells in the Permian Basin are mature oil wells that also produce high-Btu casinghead gas with significant NGLs content. These properties primarily produce at depths ranging from 2,000 feet to 12,000 feet. As of December 31, 2016, our Permian Basin properties consisted of 355,626 gross (243,043 net) leasehold acres. During 2016, our Permian Basin operations produced approximately 19,613 MMcfe, of which 67% was oil, condensate and NGLs. At December 31, 2016, these properties accounted for approximately 188,491 MMcfe or 14% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 60% were oil, condensate and NGLs. 
Piceance Basin Properties
The Piceance Basin is located in northwestern Colorado. Our Piceance Basin properties, which we operate, are located in the Gibson Gulch. The Gibson Gulch area is a basin-centered gas play along the north end of the Divide Creek anticline near the eastern limits of the Piceance Basin’s productive Mesaverde (Williams Fork) trend at depths of approximately 6,000 to 8,000 feet. As of December 31, 2016, our Piceance Basin properties consisted of 25,320 gross (17,355 net) leasehold acres. During 2016, our properties in the Piceance Basin produced approximately 30,053 MMcfe, of which 68% was natural gas. At December 31, 2016, the Piceance Basin properties accounted for approximately 328,747 MMcfe or 24% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 67% were natural gas.
Gulf Coast Basin Properties
Our Gulf Coast Basin properties include properties in the onshore Gulf Coast area, North Louisiana, Alabama, East Texas, South Texas and Mississippi.
Production from our North Louisiana properties comes from the East Haynesville and Cotton Valley fields. These properties include multiple productive zones including Cotton Valley, James Lime, Pettet, Haynesville, Smackover and Hosston. East Haynesville is located in Claiborne Parish, Louisiana and lies at a depth of approximately 9,000 to 11,000 feet. The Cotton Valley field is located in Webster Parish, Louisiana and produces from an average depth of 11,000 feet. 
Our Alabaman properties include the Big Escambia Creek, Flomaton and Fanny Church fields located in Escambia County, Alabama. These fields produce from either the Smackover or Norphlet formations at depths ranging from approximately 15,000 to 16,000 feet. The Fanny Church field is located two miles east of Big Escambia Creek. The Flomaton field is adjacent to and partially underlies the Big Escambia Creek field and produces from the Norphlet formation at depths from approximately 15,000 to 16,000 feet. The Smackover and Norphlet reservoirs are sour gas condensate reservoirs which produce gas and fluids containing a high percentage of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. These impurities are extracted at the Company-operated Big Escambia Creek Treating facility and the effluent gas is further processed for the removal of natural gas liquids in the Big Escambia Creek Gas Processing facility. The operation of the wells and the facility is closely connected, and we are the largest owner and operator of the combined assets. In addition to selling condensate, natural gas, and NGLs, we also market elemental sulfur.
Our South Texas properties primarily are located in Dewitt, Hidalgo, LaSalle, Live Oak and Webb Counties. Most of the production is high Btu gas that is produced from the Olmos and Escondido sand formations from a depth averaging 7,500 feet. 
8

Our East Texas producing properties include the Fairway (James Lime Unit) field in Henderson and Anderson counties, which is produced from an average depth of 10,000 feet. Other East Texas properties produce from the Smackover formation at an average depth of 13,500 feet and are located in Henderson, Rains, Van Zandt and Wood Counties. 
We operate the majority of our Mississippi properties which are located in the Mississippi Salt Basin. Most of our production comes from the Parker Creek field in Jones County, Mississippi, where our working interest is approximately 60%. Our production is mainly oil that produces from the Hosston Formation from a depth ranging from approximately 13,000 feet to 15,000 feet. Our other Mississippi properties are located in Covington, Jasper, Clarke, Leflore, Jefferson Davis, Wayne and Walthall Counties.
Production from our properties in the onshore Gulf Coast Basin comes from the Silsbee Field in Hardin County, Texas. Most of the Silsbee production is oil produced from the Yegua formation.
As of December 31, 2016, our Gulf Coast Basin properties consisted of 189,611 gross (91,380 net) leasehold acres. During 2016, the Gulf Coast Basin properties produced approximately 14,371 MMcfe, of which 55% were oil, condensate and NGLs. At December 31, 2016, these properties accounted for approximately 165,068 MMcfe or 12% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 46% were natural gas. 
Arkoma Basin Properties
Our Arkoma Basin properties include properties in the Woodford Shale, located in eastern Oklahoma, the Fayetteville Shale, located in Arkansas, and royalty interests and non-operated working interest in both states. As of December 31, 2016, our Arkoma Basin properties consisted of 389,344 gross (179,702 net) leasehold acres.

At December 31, 2016, the properties had total proved reserves of approximately 188,325 MMcfe or 14% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 93% were natural gas.
Big Horn Basin Properties
The Big Horn Basin is a prolific basin which is characterized by oil and natural gas fields with long production histories and multiple producing formations.
Our Elk Basin field is located in Park County, Wyoming and Carbon County, Montana. We operate all of our properties in the Elk Basin area, which includes the Embar-Tensleep, Madison and Frontier formations as discussed below.
Embar-Tensleep Formation.  Production in the Embar-Tensleep formation is being enhanced through a tertiary recovery technique involving effluent gas, or flue gas, from a natural gas processing facility located in the Elk Basin field. From 1949 to 1974, flue gas was injected into the Embar-Tensleep formation to increase pressure and improve production of resident hydrocarbons. Currently, we still use flue gas injection to maintain and improve production within this formation. Our wells in the Embar-Tensleep formation of the Elk Basin field are drilled to a depth of 5,100 to 6,600 feet.

Madison Formation.  We plan to concentrate on implementing an injection program to enhance production in the Madison formation. The wells in the Madison formation of the Elk Basin field are drilled to a depth of 4,400 to 7,000 feet.
Frontier Formation.  The Frontier formation is being produced through primary recovery techniques. The wells in the Frontier formation of the Elk Basin field are typically drilled to a depth of 1,400 to 2,700 feet.
We operate and own a 62% interest in the Elk Basin natural gas processing plant near Powell, Wyoming, which was first placed into operation in the 1940s. ExxonMobil Corporation (“Exxon”) owns a 34% interest in the Elk Basin natural gas processing plant, and other parties own the remaining 4% interest. This plant is a refrigeration natural gas processing plant that receives natural gas supplies through a natural gas gathering system from Elk Basin fields.
We also operate and own the Wildhorse pipeline system, which is an approximately 12-mile natural gas gathering system that transports approximately 1.0 MMcf/day of low-sulfur natural gas from the South Elk Basin fields to the Elk Basin natural gas processing plant.
Our Big Horn Basin properties are comprised of assets in Wyoming and the Elk Basin field in south central Montana. We own working interests ranging from 25% to 100% in our Big Horn Basin properties, which consisted of 24,512 gross (15,632 net) leasehold acres as of December 31, 2016. During 2016, our properties in the Big Horn Basin produced approximately 
9

5,776 MMcfe, of which 86% was oil. At December 31, 2016, the Big Horn Basin properties accounted for approximately 78,447 MMcfe or 6% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 93% were oil, condensate and NGLs.
Williston Basin Properties
Our Williston Basin properties are located in North Dakota and Montana, which include, among others, the Horse Creek field, the Charlson Madison Unit and the Elk field. The Horse Creek field is located in Bowman County, North Dakota and has producing oil wells from multiple horizons in the Red River formation. The Charlson Madison Unit produces from the unitized Madison formation. The Elk field is operated and produces from wells in McKenzie County, North Dakota. As of December 31, 2016, our Williston Basin properties consisted of 452,425 gross (65,744 net) leasehold acres. During 2016, the properties produced approximately 2,614 MMcfe, of which 91% was oil. Our Williston Basin properties had estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 of 23,909 MMcfe or 2% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 91% were oil.
Anadarko Basin Properties
The Anadarko Basin consists of operated and non-operated properties in the Verden field, and other fields located in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma. Within the Anadarko Basin, our assets can generally be characterized by stratigraphic plays with multiple, stacked pay zones and more complex geology than our other operating areas. Properties in in the Anadarko Basin include mature fields with long production histories.
As of December 31, 2016, our Anadarko Basin properties consisted of 99,884 gross (26,752 net) leasehold acres. During 2016, the Anadarko Basin properties produced approximately 11,726 MMcfe, of which 45% were oil, condensate and NGLs. At December 31, 2016, these properties accounted for approximately 36,123 MMcfe or 3% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 71% were natural gas. 
Wind River Basin Properties
The Wind River Basin is located in central Wyoming. Our activities are concentrated primarily in the eastern Wind River Basin, along the greater Waltman Arch. Our natural gas production in this basin is gathered through our own gathering systems and delivered to markets through pipelines owned by Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission and Colorado Interstate Gas (“CIG”). As of December 31, 2016, our Wind River Basin properties consisted of 87,531 gross (62,465 net) leasehold acres. During 2016, our Wind River Basin properties produced approximately 3,462 MMcfe, of which 93% was natural gas. At December 31, 2016, the properties had total proved reserves of approximately 22,357 MMcfe or 2% of our total estimated proved reserves, of which 93% were natural gas.
Powder River Basin Properties
The Powder River Basin is primarily located in northeastern Wyoming. Our development operations are conducted in our coalbed methane (“CBM”) fields. CBM wells are drilled to 1,500 feet on average, targeting the Big George Coals, typically producing water in a process called dewatering. This process lowers reservoir pressure, allowing the gas to desorb from the coal and flow to the well bore. As the reservoir pressure declines, the wells begin producing methane gas at an increasing rate. As the wells mature, the production peaks, stabilizes and then begins declining. The average life of a CBM well can range from five to eleven years depending on the coal seam. Our natural gas production in this basin is gathered through gathering and pipeline systems owned by Powder River Midstream, Fort Union Gas Gathering, LLC and Thunder Creek Gas Services, L.L.C.. As of December 31, 2016, our Powder River Basin properties consisted of 114,287 gross (66,866 net) leasehold acres. During 2016, the properties produced approximately 6,891 MMcfe, which was 100% natural gas. At December 31, 2016, the properties had total proved reserves of approximately 13,286 MMcfe or 1% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end.

Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Prices
We analyze the prices we realize from sales of our oil, natural gas, and NGL production and the impact on those prices of differences in market-based index prices and the effects of our derivative activities. We market our oil and natural gas production to a variety of purchasers based on regional pricing. Our natural gas production is primarily sold under market sensitive contracts which are typically priced at a differential to the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) price or the published natural gas index price for the producing area due to the natural gas quality and the proximity to major consuming markets. The West Texas Intermediate Cushing, (“WTI”) price of crude oil is a widely used benchmark in the pricing of domestic and imported oil in the United States. The relative value of crude oil is mainly determined by its quality and location. In the case of WTI pricing, the crude oil is light and sweet, meaning that it has a higher specific gravity (lightness) measured in degrees of API (“American Petroleum Institute”) gravity and low sulfur content, and is priced for delivery at Cushing, Oklahoma. In general, higher quality crude oils (lighter and sweeter) with fewer transportation requirements result in higher realized pricing for producers. 
Certain of our natural gas marketing contracts determine the price that we are paid based on the value of the dry gas sold plus a portion of the value of NGLs extracted.  Since title of the natural gas sold under these contracts passes at the outlet of the processing plant, we report residue volumes of natural gas in Mcf as production. 
The average realized prices described below include deductions for gathering, transportation and processing fees, however, these prices do not include the impact of our hedges.
Production in the Green River Basin is predominantly natural gas and is processed for the recovery of NGLs. The processed natural gas is subject to a processing agreement with Western Gas Resources in their Granger Plant facility where we take our residue natural gas in-kind for sales and NGLs are taken in-kind and sold pursuant to a liquids purchase agreement. We market our Green River Basin residue natural gas into the Rockies market through the use of multiple pipeline connections. During 2016, we received the average NYMEX price less $0.61 per Mcf in the Green River Basin. Due to the decline in the ethane price which began in 2014 and continued into 2016, the Granger Plant made an economic decision to reject ethane effective January 2015 and is expected to continue ethane rejection through 2017.
In the Permian Basin, most of our natural gas production is casinghead natural gas produced in conjunction with our oil production. Casinghead gas typically has a high Btu content and requires processing prior to sale to third parties. We have a number of processing agreements in place with gatherers/processors of our casinghead natural gas, and we share in the revenues associated with the sale of NGLs resulting from such processing, depending on the terms of the various agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we received the average NYMEX price less $0.60 per Mcf in the Permian Basin. Our oil production is sold under month-to-month sales contracts with purchasers that take delivery of the oil volumes at the tank batteries adjacent to the producing wells. We sell oil production from our operated Permian Basin properties at the wellhead to third party gathering and marketing companies. During 2016, we received the average NYMEX price less $3.87 per barrel in the Permian Basin.
Production in the Piceance Basin is predominantly natural gas and is processed for the recovery of NGLs. The processed gas is subject to a processing agreement with Enterprise Gas Processing LLC, in their Meeker Plant facility. We market our natural gas production into the Rockies market at the Northwest Rockies index pricing. During 2016, we received the average NYMEX price less $1.19 per Mcf in the Piceance Basin.
In the Gulf Coast Basin, our natural gas production has a high Btu content and requires processing prior to sale to third parties. Our proportionate share of the natural gas volumes are sold at the tailgate of the processing plant at the Houston Ship Channel and Waha Gas index pricing which typically results in a discount to NYMEX prices. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we received the average NYMEX price less $0.54 per Mcf.
Our Arkoma Basin production in the southeastern Oklahoma Woodford Shale consists predominately of natural gas with a mix of high Btu processed natural gas and unprocessed lean natural gas. The natural gas production is gathered by multiple third party entities with the processed natural gas ultimately delivered to the Targa Resources, Inc. natural gas processing complex. The processed natural gas is subject to a processing agreement with Targa Resources, Inc., where we take our residue natural gas in-kind for sales, and NGLs are sold pursuant to the terms of the processing agreement. The lean natural gas is primarily delivered directly to market. The natural gas was marketed into the Enable Gas: East index and Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Corp: Zone 4 index via a firm transportation contract that was in place prior to our acquisition of these natural gas properties. Effective August 2016, this firm transportation contract expired; therefore, we no longer receive the related index pricing. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we received the average NYMEX price less $1.00 per Mcf.
11

The marketing of heavy sour crude oil production from our Big Horn Basin properties is done through our Clearfork pipeline, which transports the crude oil to local and other refiners through connections with other pipelines.  Our Big Horn Basin sweet crude oil production is transported from the field by a third-party trucking company that delivers the crude oil to a centralized facility connected to a common carrier pipeline with delivery points accessible to local refiners in the Salt Lake City, Utah and Guernsey, Wyoming market centers. During 2016, we received the average NYMEX price less $8.85 per barrel in the Big Horn Basin. Effective March 2015, we entered into a sales contract under Western Canadian Select (“WCS”) index pricing, which provides the opportunity for us to enter into hedges for our Elk Basin production and therefore reduce our exposure to price volatility. 
 In the Williston Basin, we produce a combination of sweet and legacy sour oil. This oil is both connected to oil pipelines as well as trucked out for sales and there is minimal natural gas associated with this production. During 2016, we received the average NYMEX price less $8.96 per barrel in the Williston Basin.
Our Anadarko Basin production in Oklahoma consists predominately of natural gas with a mix of high Btu processed natural gas and unprocessed lean natural gas. The natural gas production is gathered by multiple third party entities. The lean natural gas is gathered by Enable Gathering & Processing LLC and sold to market at Enable Oklahoma Intrastate Transmission LLC’s West pool at the Panhandle, TX-Okla. index pricing. The high Btu gas is sold at the wellhead to various third party entities. The majority is sold to Oneok Field Services Company LLC and DCP Midstream LP under gas purchase contracts subject to percent of proceeds pricing for all products. During 2016, we received the average NYMEX price less $0.89 per Mcf in the Anadarko Basin. 
Our Wind River Basin properties are predominantly natural gas plays with approximately two-thirds of the production being processed at natural gas plants for the extraction of NGLs at our election. Our residue natural gas is sold into the Rockies market at the CIG index price while the NGLs are sold to a third-party natural gas processor pursuant to a processing agreement. 
Our Powder River natural gas production is classified as CBM gas and, as it is a very dry gas, is sold directly into the market upon being handled with conventional separation, treating, and transportation. The CBM gas is sold into the Rockies market at the CIG index price as well. During 2016, we received the average NYMEX price less $0.50 per Mcf in the Wind River Basin while we received the average NYMEX price less $1.73 per Mcf in the Powder River Basin.
Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Data
Estimated Proved Reserves

The following table presents our estimated net proved oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves and the present value of the estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016, as estimated by our internal reservoir engineers. The estimate of net proved reserves has not been filed with or included in reports to any federal authority or agency. The Standardized Measure value shown in the table is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves. Please see “Reserves Estimation Process” below and the “Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Information” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8.

(1) | Standardized Measure is the present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) (using the 12-month unweighted average of first-day-of-the-month price, the “12-month average price”) without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as selling, general and administrative expenses, debt service and future income tax expenses or to depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. Our Standardized Measure does not include future income tax expenses because we are not subject to income taxes and our reserves are owned by our subsidiaries which are also not subject to income taxes. Standardized Measure does not give effect to derivative transactions. For a description of our derivative transactions, please read “Item 1. Business—Operations—Price Risk and Interest Rate Management Activities” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”


(2) | For an explanation of Standardized Measure, please see “Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Information” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report.


(3) | Oil and natural gas prices are based on spot prices per Bbl and MMBtu, respectively, calculated using the “12-month average price” for January through December 2016, with these representative prices adjusted by field for quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials to arrive at the appropriate net price. NGLs prices were calculated using the differentials to the WTI price per Bbl of $42.60.

(1) | PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under generally accepted accounting principles, or “GAAP,” nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, including future cash flows related to settlement of asset retirement obligations, as defined under GAAP. However, for Vanguard, PV-10 is equal to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, including future cash flows related to settlement of asset retirement obligations, under GAAP because the Company is not a tax paying entity. For our presentation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, please see “Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Information” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report.

The data in the above tables represent estimates only. Oil, natural gas and NGLs reservoir engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. The quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that are ultimately recovered, production and operating costs, the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future sales prices may differ from those assumed in these estimates. Please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

In accordance with the guidelines of the SEC, our internal reservoir engineers’ estimates of future net revenues from our properties, and the standardized measure thereof, were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions, which requires the use of the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month prices for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2016 for each product.
Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The standardized measure shown should not be construed as the current market value of the reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate present value, which is required by Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to the timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.

From time to time, we engage reservoir engineers to prepare a reserve and economic evaluation of properties that we are considering purchasing. Neither the reservoir engineers nor any of their respective employees have any interest in those properties and the compensation for these engagements is not contingent on their estimates of reserves and future net revenues for the subject properties. During 2016, we paid DeGolyer and MacNaughton (“D&M”) approximately $0.2 million for all reserve and economic evaluations.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company has removed all PUD reserves from its total proved reserve estimate due to uncertainty regarding the availability of capital that would be required to develop the PUD reserves. The following table represents a summary of our proved undeveloped reserves activity during the year ended December 31, 2016. This activity includes updates to prior PUD reserves, and the impact of changes in economic conditions, including changes in commodity prices and the uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.

PUDs at December 31, 2016 | — | 

Divestitures. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our proved undeveloped reserves decreased due to divestitures of oil and gas properties including 116.5 Bcfe of our total proved undeveloped reserves booked as of December 31, 2015.
Conversions. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we developed approximately 46.7 Bcfe of our total proved undeveloped reserves booked as of December 31, 2015 through the drilling of 111 gross (11.8 net) wells. We also converted 19.7 Bcfe of volumes to proved developed producing which were not booked as proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2015. 
Revisions/Reclassifications: At December 31, 2016, we reclassified 473.3 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves to the contingent resource category. Contingent resources are resources that are potentially recoverable, but not yet considered mature enough for development due to technological or capital restraints. Because substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern, in determining year-end 2016 reserves amounts, we concluded we lacked the required degree of certainty about our ability to fund a development drilling program and the availability of capital resources that would be required to develop PUD reserves. As a result of our inability to meet the reasonable certainty criteria for recording these PUD reserves as prescribed by the SEC, we did not record any PUD locations in the December 31, 2016 reserve report.
Development Plans. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we spent $20.1 million or approximately 28% of our 2016 proved undeveloped reserves capital expenditures budget fully converting 46.7 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves recorded at December 31, 2015. 
As commodity prices remained depressed throughout 2015 and most of 2016, we revised our development plan. As of December 31, 2016, we were developing our properties at a significantly slower pace than was anticipated in our December 31, 2015 reserve report. In addition, as part of our internal controls over determining a plan to develop our proved reserves each year, we consider whether we have the financial ability to develop our proved undeveloped reserves. This year, because substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern, we no longer expect to develop our proved undeveloped reserves within five years of initial booking, due to uncertainty that we have the ability to fund a development plan. Therefore, as of December 31, 2016, we reclassified all of our proved undeveloped reserves to contingent resources. 
Substantially all of our developed and undeveloped leasehold acreage is held by production, which means that as long as our wells on the acreage continue to produce, we will continue to hold the leases. The leases in which we hold an interest that are not held by production are not considered material to us.
Reserve Estimation Process
Estimates of proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were based on studies performed by our internal reservoir engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC. Our reserve estimation process is a collaborative effort coordinated by our reservoir engineers in compliance with our internal controls for such process. Reserve information as well as models used to estimate such reserves are stored on secured databases. Non-technical inputs used in reserve estimation models, including crude oil, natural gas and NGLs prices, production costs, future capital expenditures and our net ownership percentages are obtained from other departments within the Company. Our internal reservoir engineers perform review procedures with respect to such non-technical inputs. Reserve variances are discussed among the internal reservoir engineers and the Executive Vice President of Operations.
We use technologies to establish proved reserves that have been demonstrated to provide consistent results capable of repetition. The technologies and economic data being used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, production data, well test data, geologic maps, electrical logs and radioactivity logs. The estimated reserves of wells with sufficient production history are estimated using appropriate decline curves. Estimated reserves of producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations are estimated using performance data from analogous wells in the area. These wells are considered analogous based on production performance from the same formation and with similar completion techniques.

Our reservoir engineering group is directly responsible for our reserve evaluation process and consists of eight professionals, four of whom hold, at a minimum, bachelor’s degrees in engineering. Within our Company, our Reservoir Engineering Manager is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimates. Our Reservoir Engineering Manager has over 30 years of experience and graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a Masters of Science Degree in Geology/Geophysics.

The technical persons responsible for preparing the reserve estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
Independent Audit of Reserves
We engage independent petroleum engineers to audit a substantial portion of our reserve estimates. Our audit procedures require the independent engineers to prepare their own estimates of proved reserves for properties comprising at least 80% of our year-end proved reserves. Our board of directors requires that the independent petroleum engineers’ estimate of reserve quantities for the properties audited by the independent petroleum engineers are within 10% of our internal estimate. Once completed, our year-end reserves are presented to senior management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and the Executive Vice President of Operations, for approval.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we engaged D&M, an independent petroleum engineering firm, to perform reserve audit services. The opinion by D&M for the year ended December 31, 2016 covered producing areas containing 94.5% of our proved reserves on a net-equivalent-barrel-of-oil basis. D&M’s opinion indicates that the estimates of proved reserves prepared by our internal reservoir engineers for the properties reviewed by D&M, when compared in total on a net-equivalent-barrel-of-oil basis, do not differ materially from the estimates prepared by D&M. Such estimates by D&M in the aggregate were within our 10% variation tolerance when compared to those prepared by our reservoir engineering group. The report prepared by D&M was developed utilizing geological and engineering data we provided. The report of D&M dated February 10, 2017 which contains further discussion of the reserve estimates and evaluations prepared by D&M, as well as the qualifications of D&M’s technical person primarily responsible for overseeing such estimates and evaluations, is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference. 
Within D&M, the lead technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the audit of our reserves is Mr. Gregory K. Graves. Mr. Graves is a Senior Vice President with D&M and has over 32 years of experience in oil and gas reservoir studies and reserves evaluations. He graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 1984 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Petroleum Engineering and is a member of the International Society of Petroleum Engineers and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. Mr. Graves meets or exceeds the education, training and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines.

(1) | Developed acres are acres spaced or assigned to productive wells.


(2) | Undeveloped acres are acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil or natural gas, regardless of whether such leasehold acreage contains proved reserves.


(3) | A gross acre is an acre in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross acres is the total number of acres in which a working interest is owned.


(4) | A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of the fractional ownership working interests in gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.

Drilling Activity
The following is a description of the Company’s drilling and completion activities during the year ended December 31, 2016.
In the Green River Basin, we participated in the drilling of 148 gross wells (18.4 net) and the completion of 120 gross wells (15.2 net) in Sublette County in southwestern Wyoming. These wells are directionally drilled from pads but are vertical through 
18

the 4,000 feet pay section. The average well depth is approximately 14,000 feet and is typically completed with 14 to 20 frac stages.
In the Permian Basin, we participated with a 3.6% working interest in the drilling of two vertical wells in Gaines County, Texas. We also participated with a 7.8% working interest in the drilling and completion of two horizontal wells in Glasscock County, Texas. The vertical wells were drilled to an average depths of approximately 10,400 feet to 12,000 feet. The horizontal wells were drilled to vertical depths of 8,000 to 16,000 feet and extended with horizontal lateral lengths of approximately 5,000 to 10,000 feet.
In the Gulf Coast Basin, we participated with a 6.0% working interest in the drilling and completion of one horizontal well in the East Haynesville field in Claiborne County, Louisiana. The well was drilled to a vertical depth of approximately 8,000 feet. 
In the Arkoma Basin, we participated in the drilling and completion of four (0.05 net) horizontal wells in Cleburne County, Arkansas. We also participated with an average of 0.2% working interest in the drilling of two horizontal wells in White County, Arkansas. In addition, we participated with a 4.2% working interest in the drilling and completion of a horizontal well in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma. These wells were drilled to vertical depths of 8,000 to 16,000 feet and extended with horizontal lateral lengths of approximately 5,000 to 10,000 feet. 
In the Anadarko Basin, we participated in the drilling of 17 gross horizontal wells (0.6 net) and the completion of 9 gross horizontal wells (0.2 net) in several counties in Oklahoma. These wells were drilled to vertical depths of 8,000 to 16,000 feet and extended with horizontal lateral lengths of approximately 5,000 to 10,000 feet. 
We currently anticipate a capital expenditures budget for 2017 of approximately $150.0 million to $155.0 million, compared to the $64.5 million we spent in 2016. During 2017, we intend to concentrate our drilling on low risk, development opportunities with the majority of drilling capital focused on high Btu natural gas wells in four areas which we believe will continue to offer attractive drilling returns. We expect to spend between $57.0 million to $59.0 million or approximately 38% of the 2017 capital budget in the Green River Basin where we will participate as a non-operated partner in the drilling and completion of vertical natural gas wells. Additionally, we expect to spend between $25.0 million to $26.0 million or approximately 17% of the capital budget in the Piceance Basin, at Mamm Creek Field where we will operate a one rig program drilling and completing vertical gas wells. The balance of our capital drilling will be focused in the Gulf Coast Basin at Haynesville Field in Louisiana operating a one rig program drilling and completing vertical gas wells and in the Arkoma Basin operating a one rig program drilling and completing horizontal Woodford wells. 
The following table sets forth information with respect to wells completed during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Our drilling activity during these periods has consisted entirely of drilling development wells. We have not drilled any exploratory wells during these periods. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of oil, natural gas, and NGLs regardless of whether they produce a reasonable rate of return.

Operations

Principal Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs to Mieco Inc., ConocoPhillips, Plains Marketing, L.P., Tenaska and Marathon Oil Company accounted for approximately 12%, 11%, 6%, 5% and 3%, respectively, of our oil, natural gas and NGLs revenues. Our top five purchasers during the year ended December 31, 2016 therefore accounted for 37% of our total revenues. To the extent these and other customers reduce the volumes of oil, natural gas and NGLs that they purchase from us and they are not replaced in a timely manner with a new customer, our revenues and cash available for distribution could decline. However, if we were to lose a customer, we believe a substitute purchaser could be identified in a timely manner and upon similar terms and conditions.
Delivery Commitments and Marketing Arrangements
Our oil and natural gas production is principally sold to marketers, processors, refiners, and other purchasers that have access to nearby pipeline, processing and gathering facilities. In areas where there is no practical access to pipelines, oil is trucked to central storage facilities where it is aggregated and sold to various markets and downstream purchasers. Our production sales agreements generally contain customary terms and conditions for the oil and natural gas industry, provide for sales based on prevailing market prices in the area, and generally are month-to-month or have terms of one year or less. 
We generally sell our natural gas production from our operated properties on the spot market or under market-sensitive, short-term agreements with credit-worthy purchasers, including independent marketing companies, gas processing companies, and other purchasers who have the ability to pay the highest price for the natural gas production and move the natural gas under the most efficient and effective transportation agreements. Because all of our natural gas production from our operated properties is sold under market-priced agreements, we are positioned to take advantage of future increases in natural gas prices but we are also subject to any future price declines. We do market our own natural gas on some of our non-operated properties. 
The marketing of heavy sour crude oil production from our Big Horn Basin properties is done through our Clearfork pipeline, which transports the crude oil to local and other refiners through connections to other export pipelines. Our Big Horn Basin sweet crude oil production is transported from the field by a third party trucking company that delivers the crude oil to a centralized facility connected to a common carrier pipeline with delivery points accessible to local refiners in the Salt Lake City, Utah and Guernsey, Wyoming market centers. We sell oil production from our operated Permian Basin properties at the wellhead to third-party gathering and marketing companies.
Our natural gas is transported through our own and third-party gathering systems and pipelines, and we incur processing, gathering and transportation expenses to move our natural gas from the wellhead to a specified delivery point. These expenses vary based on the volume and distance shipped, and the fee charged by the third-party gatherer, processor or transporter. Capacity on these gathering systems and pipelines is occasionally limited and at times unavailable because of repairs or improvements, or as a result of priority transportation agreements with other gas shippers. While our ability to market our natural gas has been only infrequently limited or delayed, if transportation space is restricted or is unavailable, our cash flow from the affected properties could be adversely affected. In certain instances, we may enter into firm transportation agreements to provide for pipeline capacity to flow and sell a portion of our gas volumes. Currently, a majority of our existing firm transportation agreements were assumed in connection with acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties. These agreements have term delivery commitments of fixed and determinable quantities of natural gas. Please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Commitments and Contractual Obligations” for additional information regarding our long-term firm transportation contracts.
The following table sets forth information about material long-term firm transportation contracts for pipeline capacity, which typically require a demand charge. We source the gas to meet these commitments from our producing properties. We have certain commitments that we assumed as part of our acquisitions of oil and gas properties where the production from the acquired properties and the production of joint interest owners that we market were not adequate to meet the commitments resulting to us paying the set demand charge relating to the maximum daily quantity outlined in the contract. During the year ending December 31, 2017, our firm transportation contracts obligate us to deliver 80,200 MMBtu of natural gas per day.

Price Risk and Interest Rate Management Activities
Historically we entered into derivative transactions in the form of hedging arrangements to reduce the impact of oil, natural gas and NGLs price volatility on our cash flow from operations. As of December 31, 2016, we have terminated all of our commodity hedge contracts. Traditionally, we routinely primarily engaged in fixed-price swaps, basis swap contracts and other hedge option contracts to hedge oil and natural gas prices. By removing the price volatility from a significant portion of our oil and natural gas production, we are able to mitigate for a period of time, but not eliminate, the potential effects of fluctuation in oil and natural gas prices on our cash flow from operations. As such, our revenues are more susceptible to commodity price volatility as our commodity price hedges settle and are not replaced. As of December 31, 2016, we have terminated all of our commodity hedge contracts. For a description of our derivative positions, please read “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”
Competition

The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil companies in acquiring properties, leasing acreage, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staff substantially larger than ours or a different business model. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial, technical or personnel resources will permit.

We are also affected by competition for drilling rigs and the availability of related equipment. In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has delayed development drilling and has caused significant price increases. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may occur or how they would affect our development program.

Competition is also strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties, undeveloped leases and drilling rights, and we cannot assure unitholders that we will be able to compete satisfactorily when attempting to make further acquisitions.

Title to Properties
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, however, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. As a result, we have obtained title opinions on a significant portion of our oil and natural gas properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests, contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for taxes not yet payable and other burdens, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties, or will materially interfere with our use of these properties in the operation of our business.
21

Natural Gas Gathering
We own and operate a network of natural gas gathering systems in the Gulf Coast Basin, Piceance Basin, Big Horn Basin in Wyoming, and the Potato Hills Pipeline in Oklahoma. These systems gather and transport our natural gas and a small amount of third-party natural gas to larger gathering systems and intrastate, interstate and local distribution pipelines. Our network of natural gas gathering systems permits us to transport production from our wells with fewer interruptions and also minimizes any delays associated with a gathering company extending its lines to our wells. Our ownership and control of these lines enables us to:

• | realize faster connection of newly drilled wells to the existing system;


• | control pipeline operating pressures and capacity to maximize production;


• | control compression costs and fuel use;


• | maintain system integrity;


• | control the monthly nominations on the receiving pipelines to prevent imbalances and penalties; and


• | track sales volumes and receipts closely to assure all production values are realized.

Seasonal Nature of Business
Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other operations in some of our operating areas, and as a result we generally perform the majority of our drilling in these areas during the summer and fall months. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increased costs or delay our operations. Generally, but not always, oil is typically in higher demand in the summer for its use in road construction and natural gas is in higher demand in the winter for heating. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas consumers utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters
General.   Our business involving the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties is subject to extensive and stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, environmental protection, and the health and safety of employees. Our operations are subject to the same environmental, health and safety laws and regulations as other similarly situated companies in the oil and natural gas industry. These laws and regulations may:

• | require the acquisition of permits before commencing drilling or other regulated activities;


• | require the installation of expensive pollution control equipment and performance of costly remedial measures to mitigate or prevent pollution from historical and ongoing operations, such as pit closure and plugging of abandoned wells;


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities;


• | limit or prohibit drilling activities on lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas;


• | impose specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection;


• | impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations; and


• | require preparation of a Resource Management Plan, an Environmental Assessment, and/or an Environmental Impact Statement for operations affecting federal lands or leases.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of removal or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations deemed in non-compliance. Moreover, these laws and regulations may restrict our ability to produce oil, natural gas and NGLs by, among other things, limiting production from our wells, limiting the number of wells we are allowed to drill or limiting the locations at which we may conduct our drilling operations. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly well drilling, 
22

construction, completion and water management activities, or waste handling, disposal and clean-up requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs. We believe that operation of our wells is in substantial compliance with all current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. However, we cannot provide any assurance on how future compliance with existing or newly adopted environmental laws and regulations may impact our properties or the operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not incur any material capital expenditures for performance of remediation or installation of pollution control equipment at any of our facilities; however, we did incur capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business to comply with pollution control requirements. As of the date of this Annual Report, we are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures during 2017 or that will otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations.

The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our operations as well as the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry in general.

Waste Handling.  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or “RCRA,” and comparable state laws, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of “hazardous wastes” as well as the disposal of non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the “EPA,” individual states administer some or all of the federal provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent state requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and many other wastes associated with the exploitation, development, and production of crude oil, natural gas, or geothermal energy are currently regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions. However, by amendment of existing RCRA laws and regulations, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such generated wastes, which cost increase could be significant. In the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as RCRA hazardous wastes.

 Hazardous Substance Releases.   The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, also known as “CERCLA,” or “Superfund,” and analogous state laws, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transportation or disposal of the hazardous substance found at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. While materials are generated in the course of operation of our wells that may be regulated as hazardous substances, we have not received any pending notifications that we may be potentially responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA.

We currently own, lease, or have a non-operating interest in numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas production for many years. Although we believe that operating and waste disposal practices used on these properties in the past were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where these substances, wastes and hydrocarbons have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination.
As of December 31, 2016, we have recorded $16.2 million for future remedial costs and abandonment liability for decommissioning the Big Escambia Creek, Elk Basin, and Fairway natural gas processing plants.

• | Our Elk Basin assets include a natural gas processing plant. Previous environmental investigations of the Elk Basin natural gas processing plant indicate historical soil and groundwater contamination by hydrocarbons and the presence of asbestos-containing material at the site. Although the environmental investigations did not identify an immediate need for remediation of the suspected historical hydrocarbon contamination or abatement of the asbestos, the extent of the hydrocarbon contamination is not known and, therefore, the potential liability for remediating this contamination may be significant. In the event we cease operating the gas plant, the cost of decommissioning it and addressing the

23

previously identified environmental conditions and other conditions, such as waste disposal, could be significant. We do not anticipate ceasing operations at the Elk Basin natural gas processing plant in the near future nor a need to commence remedial activities at this time. However, a regulatory agency could require us to investigate and remediate any hydrocarbon contamination even while the gas plant remains in operation. 

• | In addition, we also own and operate the Fairway natural gas processing plant in the Gulf Coast Basin, for which we have reserved abandonment costs.


• | We continue to operate a groundwater remediation project at our Big Escambia Creek gas plant. This release occurred when a prior owner operated the Big Escambia Creek gas plant. We are carrying out the cleanup under the supervision of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, which has approved the risk assessment. We are currently evaluating alternative groundwater treatment technologies. Our current estimate of total remedial costs is no more than approximately $1.0 million. 

Our estimates of the future remediation cost are subject to change, and the actual cost of these items could vary significantly from the above estimates. Due to the significant uncertainty associated with the known environmental liabilities at the gas plants, our estimate of the future abandonment liability includes a reserve.
On March 17, 2016, the Petroleum and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration proposed updates to its safety requirements for liquid (i.e., crude oil, refined products, and natural gas liquids) pipelines. The proposal would require operators to inspect many more pipelines with instrumented in-line inspection tools, repair identified defects more quickly, and require leak detection systems for all regulated pipelines. 

Water Discharges.   The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, or “Clean Water Act,” and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes, into state waters as well as waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the relevant state with delegated authority. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure, or “SPCC,” requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters by an oil spill or release. If an oil spill or release were to occur as a result of our operations, we expect that it would be contained and remediated in accordance with our SPCC plan together with the assistance of trained first responders and any oil spill response contractor that we may have engaged to address such spills and releases. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws can impose substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance including spills and other non-authorized discharges.
Fluids associated with oil and natural gas production, consisting primarily of salt water, are disposed by injection in below ground disposal wells. These disposal wells are regulated pursuant to the Underground Injection Control, or UIC, program established under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, and analogous state laws. The UIC program requires permits from the EPA or an analogous state agency for the construction and operation of disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for disposal well operations, and restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be disposed. While we believe that our disposal well operations substantially comply with requirements under the UIC program, a change in disposal well regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of salt water and ultimately increase the cost of our operations. For example, there exists a growing concern that the injection of saltwater and other fluids into below ground disposal wells triggers seismic activity in certain areas, including Texas, where we operate. In response to these concerns, in October 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission, or TRC, published a final rule governing permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that would require, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the injected fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the TRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well. These new seismic permitting requirements applicable to disposal wells impose more stringent permitting requirements and likely to result in added costs to comply or, perhaps, may require alternative methods of disposing of salt water and other fluids, which could delay production schedules and also result in increased costs.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or “OPA,” amends the Clean Water Act and sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities, and onshore facilities, including exploration and production facilities that are the site of a release of oil into waters of the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties, including owners and operators of onshore facilities, may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural 
24

resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. We believe we are in substantial compliance with the Clean Water Act, OPA and analogous state laws.
Hydraulic Fracturing.  Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We commonly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. 
While hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, and other similar state agencies, increased federal interest has arisen in recent years. 

• | From time to time Congress has considered adopting legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.


• | Federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. The EPA has issued final Clean Air Act regulations governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing; issued in April 2015 a proposed rule that would establish effluent limit guidelines that wastewater from shale gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a treatment plant; and issued in May 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, in March 2015, the BLM issued a final rule containing disclosure requirements and other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. In July 2016, however, a federal district court struck down the BLM rule, finding that the agency lacked the statutory authority to issue the rule. BLM and the Interior Department appealed the ruling in August 2016. 


• | In addition, federal agency reviews are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices. In December 2016, the EPA released final assessment of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. These existing or any future studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing activities. 

Some states in which the Company operates, including Montana, North Dakota, Texas and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, as the State of New York announced in December 2014 with regard to fracturing activities in New York. Also, local government may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.

To our knowledge, there have been no citations, suits, or contamination of potable drinking water arising from our fracturing operations. We do not have insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations; however, we believe our general liability and excess liability and control of well insurance policies would cover third-party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of such policies.
Air Emissions.   The Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from sources through air emissions permitting programs and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and their implementing regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to result in the emission of new or increased existing air pollutants, obtain and strictly comply with air permit requirements containing various emissions and operational limitations, or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. To date, we believe that no significant difficulties have been encountered in obtaining air permits. Oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for emissions of pollutants. For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule that strengthened the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, or “NAAQS,” for ozone from 75 parts per billion, or “ppb,” to 70 ppb for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. The 
25

lower ozone standard could result in states implementing new, more stringent regulations, which could apply to our operations. Compliance with this or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business.
Activities on Federal Lands.  Oil and natural gas exploitation and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended, or “NEPA.” NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will typically prepare an Environmental Assessment to assess the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. Our current production activities, as well as proposed development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits or similar authorizations that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay, limit or increase the cost of developing oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay or halt projects.
Climate Change.  In response to findings made by the EPA that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases, or “GHGs,” present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gasses are contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that establish Title V operation and Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or “PSD,” construction permitting reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards, which typically will be established by the states. These EPA rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources including, among others, onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. We are conducting monitoring of GHG emissions from certain of our operations in accordance with the GHG emissions reporting rule and we believe that our monitoring and reporting activities are in substantial compliance with applicable reporting obligations.
While from time to time Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. The adoption of any legislation or regulations that requires reporting of GHGs or otherwise restricts emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. For example, as part of the Obama Administration’s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025, EPA published in the Federal Register on June 3, 2016, its Methane Rule. The Methane Rule requires oil and gas companies to find and repair leaks, capture gas from completion of fracked wells, limit emissions from new and modified pneumatic pumps, limit emissions from several types of equipment used at gas transmission compressor stations, including compessors and pneumatic controllers, and requires “green completions” to capture natural gas from most new fractured wells. It applies to well site activities commenced on or after September 18, 2015. States and industry groups have challenged the Methane rule in the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals.
Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations. 
Endangered Species Act Considerations.  Various federal and state statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered and their habitats, migratory birds, wetlands and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Clean Water Act. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or “FWS,” is required to make a determination on listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA through the agency’s 2018 fiscal year.  
If endangered species are located in areas of the underlying properties where we wish to conduct seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations, such work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. If we were to cause harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat or natural resources as a result of our operations, government entities or, at times, private parties could seek to prevent oil and gas exploration or development activities or seek 
26

damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and, in some cases, the government could seek criminal penalties. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. 
While some of our facilities or leased acreage may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species, we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with the ESA. For example, on March 27, 2014, the FWS announced the listing of the lesser prairie chicken, whose habitat is over a five-state region, including Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Oklahoma, where we conduct operations, as a threatened species under the ESA. The FWS also announced a final rule that will limit regulatory impacts on landowners and businesses from the listing if those landowners and businesses have entered into certain range-wide conservation planning agreements, such as those developed by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, or WAFWA, pursuant to which such parties agreed to take steps to protect the lesser prairie chicken’s habitat and to pay a mitigation fee if its actions harm the lesser prairie chicken’s habitat. We have been a party to a Conservation Easement governing nearly 50,000 of affected acreage pursuant to which we agree to adopt certain adaptive management principles and pay an acreage-based mitigation assessment. Calendar year 2016 is the final year during which we expect to pay such assessment.
Occupational Safety and Health.  We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or “OSHA,” and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we maintain and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.

Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules, orders and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. For example, on July 1, 2014, the North Dakota Industrial Commission adopted Order No. 24665, or the “July 2014 Order,” pursuant to which the agency adopted legally enforceable “gas capture percentage goals” targeting the capture of 74% of natural gas produced in the State by October 1, 2014, 77% percent of such gas by January 1, 2015, 85% of such gas by January 1, 2016 and 90% of such gas by October 1, 2020. The July 2014 Order establishes an enforcement mechanism for policy recommendations that were previously adopted by the North Dakota Industrial Commission in March 2014. Those recommendations required all exploration and production operators applying for new drilling permits in the state after June 1, 2014 to develop Gas Capture Plans that provide measures for reducing the amount of natural gas flared by those operators so as to be consistent with the agency’s now-implemented gas capture percentage goals. In particular, the July 2014 Order provides that after an initial 90-day period, wells must meet or exceed the North Dakota Industrial Commission’s gas capture percentage goals on a per-well, per-field, county, or statewide basis. Failure to comply with the gas capture percentage goals will result in an operator having to restrict its production to 200 barrels of oil per day if at least 60% of the monthly volume of associated natural gas produced from the well is captured, or 100 barrels of oil per day if less than 60% of such monthly volume of natural gas is captured. While we believe that we were in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2016 and expect to remain in compliance in the future, there is no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.

Drilling and Production.   Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following:


• | the location of wells;


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;


• | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;

27


• | the plugging and abandoning of wells; and


• | notice to surface owners and other third parties.

State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploitation while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction.

Regulation of Transportation and Sales.   The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs. The interstate transportation of natural gas is subject to federal regulation primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or “FERC,” under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or “NGA.”  FERC regulates interstate natural gas pipeline transportation rates and service conditions, which may affect the marketing and sales of natural gas.  FERC requires interstate pipelines to offer available firm transportation capacity on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis to all natural gas shippers.  FERC frequently reviews and modifies its regulations regarding the transportation of natural gas with the stated goal of fostering competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.  State laws and regulations generally govern the gathering and intrastate transportation of natural gas. Natural gas gathering systems in the states in which we operate are generally required to offer services on a non-discriminatory basis and are subject to state ratable take and common purchaser statutes.  Ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling.  Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply.
The ability to transport oil and NGLs is generally dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act, or subject to regulation by the particular state in which such transportation takes place.  Laws and regulation applicable to pipeline transportation of oil largely require pipelines to charge just and reasonable rates published in agency-approved tariffs and require pipelines to provide non-discriminatory access and terms and conditions of service. The justness and reasonableness of interstate oil and natural gas liquid pipeline rates can be challenged at FERC through a protest or a complaint and, if such a protest or complaint results in a lower rate than that on file, pipeline shippers may be eligible to receive refunds or, in the case of a complaining shipper, reparations for the two-year period prior to the filing of the complaint. Certain regulations imposed by FERC, by the United States Department of Transportation and by other regulatory authorities on pipeline transporters in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of pipeline transportation service.  We do not believe, however, that these regulations affect us any differently than other producers.
Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, or “EPAct 2005,” Congress made it unlawful for any entity, as defined in the EPAct 2005, including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers such as us, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services regulated by the FERC that violates the FERC’s rules. FERC’s rules implementing EPAct 2005 make it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. EPAct 2005 also gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act up to $1,000,000 per day per violation. Pursuant to authority granted to FERC by EPAct 2005, FERC has also put in place additional regulations intended to prevent market manipulation and to promote price transparency.  For example, FERC has imposed new rules discussed below requiring wholesale purchasers and sellers of natural gas to report to FERC certain aggregated volume and other purchase and sales data for the previous calendar year. While EPAct 2005 reflects a significant expansion of the FERC’s enforcement authority, we do not anticipate that we will be affected by EPAct 2005 any differently than energy industry participants.
In 2007, FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (“Order 704”). Under Order 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtu of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors and natural gas marketers are now required to report on Form No. 552, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, 
28

contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. Pursuant to Order 704, we may be required to annually report to FERC, starting May 1 of each year, information regarding natural gas purchase and sale transactions depending on the volume of natural gas transacted during the prior calendar year. In recent years, FERC has also issued rules prohibiting anticompetitive behavior by multiple affiliates of the same entity in the natural gas capacity release market, issued a policy statement providing natural gas pipelines a cost-recovery mechanism to recoup capital expenditures made to modernize pipeline infrastructure, and issued a rule adopting reforms to its scheduling rules to improve coordination between the natural gas and electric markets.
On August 6, 2009, the Federal Trade Commission, or “FTC,” issued a Final Rule prohibiting manipulative and deceptive conduct in the wholesale petroleum markets. The Final Rule applies to transactions in crude oil, gasoline, and petroleum distillates. The FTC promulgated the Final Rule pursuant to Section 811 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, or “EISA,” which makes it unlawful for anyone, in connection with the wholesale purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates, to use any “manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Federal Trade Commission may prescribe.” The Final Rule prohibits any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale, from: (a) knowingly engaging in any act, practice, or course of business – including making any untrue statement of material fact that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person; or (b) intentionally failing to state a material fact that under the circumstances renders a statement made by such person misleading, provided that such omission distorts or is likely to distort market conditions for any such product.
Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, FERC and the courts. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these or the above regulatory changes to our natural gas operations. We do not believe that we would be affected by any such FERC action materially differently than other natural gas companies with whom we compete.
The price at which we buy and sell natural gas is currently not subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. Sales of condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. However, with regard to our physical purchases and sales of these energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC and/or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or “CFTC.” Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, market participants, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. 
Although natural gas and oil prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the operations of the underlying properties.
State Regulation.  The various states regulate the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil, natural gas and NGLs, including imposing severance and other production-related taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Reduced rates or credits may apply to certain types of wells and production methods. 
States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not currently regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil, natural gas and NGLs that may be produced from our wells, to increase our cost of production, to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill and to limit the availability of pipeline capacity to bring our products to market.
In addition to production taxes, Texas, Oklahoma and Montana each impose ad valorem taxes on oil and natural gas properties and production equipment. Wyoming and New Mexico impose an ad valorem tax on the gross value of oil and natural gas production in lieu of an ad valorem tax on the underlying oil and natural gas properties. Wyoming also imposes an ad valorem tax on production equipment. North Dakota imposes an ad valorem tax on gross oil and natural gas production in lieu of an ad valorem tax on the underlying oil and gas leases or on production equipment used on oil and gas leases.
The petroleum industry participants are also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of these regulations and those laws relate to occupational safety, resource conservation and equal employment 
29

opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these regulations and laws will have a material adverse effect upon the unitholders.
Federal, State or Native American Leases.  Our operations on federal, state, or Native American oil and natural gas leases are subject to numerous restrictions, including nondiscrimination statutes. Such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the BLM and other agencies. 
Operating Hazards and Insurance
The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including fires, explosions, blowouts, environmental hazards and other potential events that can adversely affect our ability to conduct operations and cause us to incur substantial losses. Such losses could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, exploitation or leasehold acquisitions or result in loss of properties.
In accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, potential risks and losses. We do not carry business interruption insurance except for our Elk Basin and Fairway gas plants as well as for our Piceance compressor assets. We may not obtain insurance for certain risks if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable at a reasonable cost.  If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect us.
Employees
As of March 13, 2017, we had 357 full-time employees. We also contract for the services of independent consultants involved in land, regulatory, tax, accounting, financial and other disciplines as needed. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
