Item 1. | BUSINESS

General
SunTrust Banks, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “SunTrust,” or “the Company”) is a leading provider of financial services, with our headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia. Our principal subsidiary is SunTrust Bank (“the Bank”). The Company was incorporated in the State of Georgia in 1984 and offers a full line of financial services for consumers, businesses, corporations, institutions, and not-for-profit entities, both through its branches (located primarily in Florida, Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Maryland, South Carolina, and the District of Columbia) and through other national delivery channels. The Bank offers deposit, credit, and trust and investment services to its clients through a selection of full-, self-, and assisted-service channels, including branch, call center, Teller Connect™ machines, ATMs, online, mobile, and tablet. Other subsidiaries provide capital markets, mortgage banking, securities brokerage, investment banking, and wealth management services. At December 31, 2017, the Company had total assets of $206 billion and total deposits of $161 billion.
We operate two business segments: Consumer and Wholesale, with our functional activities included in Corporate Other.
Additional information regarding our businesses and subsidiaries is included in the information set forth in Item 7, MD&A, as well as Note 20, “Business Segment Reporting,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Regulation and Supervision
We are limited under the BHC Act to banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the FRB has determined to be closely related to banking. The Company, a BHC, elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the GLBA, allowing it to engage in a broader range of activities that are (i) financial in nature or incidental to financial activities or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general. These expanded services include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting, merchant banking, and insurance company portfolio investment, and are subject to the Volcker Rule and other restrictions discussed below.
As a financial holding company, the Company and its banking subsidiary are required to be “well capitalized” and “well managed” while maintaining at least a “satisfactory” CRA rating. In the event of noncompliance, the Federal Reserve may, among other things, limit the Company’s ability to conduct these broader financial activities or, if the deficiencies persist, may require the Company to divest its banking subsidiary. Furthermore, if the Company does not have a satisfactory CRA rating, it may not commence any new financial activities, although the Company will still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking.
The Federal Reserve regulates BHCs under the BHC Act, with residual supervisory authority over “functionally regulated” subsidiaries such as the Company's broker-dealer and investment 


adviser subsidiaries. Our non-banking subsidiaries are regulated by various other regulatory bodies with supervisory authority over the particular activities of those subsidiaries. For example, STRH and STIS are broker-dealers registered with the SEC and members of FINRA, and STAS is an investment advisor registered with the SEC. STIS is also an insurance agency registered with state insurance commissions.
The Bank is an FDIC-insured commercial bank chartered under the laws of the State of Georgia and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. In addition to regulation by the FRB, the Bank and the Company are regulated by the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance. The FDIC also has jurisdiction over certain activities of the Bank as an insured depository institution. As a Georgia-chartered commercial bank, the Bank's powers are limited to activities permitted by Georgia and federal banking laws. Generally, the Bank may engage in all usual banking activities such as taking deposits, lending money, issuing letters of credit, currency trading, and offering safe deposit box services.
As an umbrella supervisor under the GLBA's system of functional regulation, the FRB requires that financial holding companies operate in a safe and sound manner so that their financial condition does not threaten the viability of affiliated depository institutions. 
The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, implemented changes that affected the oversight and supervision of financial institutions, provided for a new resolution procedure for large financial companies, created the CFPB, introduced more stringent regulatory capital requirements and significant changes in the regulation of OTC derivatives, reformed the regulation of credit rating agencies, increased controls and transparency in corporate governance and executive compensation practices, incorporated the Volcker Rule, required registration of advisers to certain private funds, and influenced significant changes in the securitization market. Dodd-Frank Act requirements typically apply to BHCs with greater than $10 billion of consolidated assets, and the requirements increase at certain asset size thresholds (most notably, $50 billion of consolidated assets and $250 billion of consolidated assets).
Enhanced Prudential Standards
BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more are subject to enhanced prudential standards and capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the FRB to establish heightened prudential standards for (i) risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, (ii) liquidity risk management requirements, (iii) overall risk management requirements, (iv) stress testing, (v) resolution planning, (vi) credit exposure and concentration limits, and (vii) early remediation actions that must be taken under certain conditions in the early stages of financial distress.
In February 2014, the FRB adopted a final rule implementing the enhanced liquidity and risk management requirements; it requires greater supervision and oversight of liquidity and general risk management by boards of directors and includes capital planning and stress testing requirements. In 


1

addition, the rule requires publicly traded U.S. BHCs with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more to establish enterprise-wide risk committees. The liquidity risk management requirements are in addition to those imposed by the LCR rule. 
Enhanced Capital Standards
In July 2013, the U.S. banking regulators promulgated final rules substantially implementing the Basel III capital framework and various Dodd-Frank Act provisions (the “Capital Rules”). The Capital Rules increased regulatory capital requirements of U.S. banking organizations and revised the level at which the Bank becomes subject to corrective action as described in the “prompt corrective action” section below. The “Collins” amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act required federal banking regulators to impose a generally applicable leverage capital ratio regardless of institution size and to phase out certain “hybrid” capital elements from Tier 1 capital treatment. The Company became subject to the Capital Rules on January 1, 2015. For additional information regarding the Capital Rules, including recent updates and/or changes to the rules and related requirements, refer to the "Capital Resources" section of Item 7, MD&A, in this Form 10-K. 
Distributions
There are various legal and regulatory limits on the extent to which the Bank may pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to its Parent Company. Federal and state bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prevent the Bank from paying dividends or engaging in any other activity that, in the opinion of the agency, would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Restrictions on capital distributions, share repurchases and redemptions, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers are imposed on banks that are unable to sustain the capital conservation buffer above the minimum CET1, Tier 1, and Total capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer is a buffer above the minimum levels designed to ensure that banks remain well-capitalized, even in adverse economic scenarios.
See additional discussion of Basel III in the "Capital Resources" section of Item 7, MD&A, in this Form 10-K.
Mandatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”); Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”) 
In September 2014, the FRB, OCC, and the FDIC approved rulemaking that established, for the first time, a quantitative minimum LCR for large, internationally active banking organizations, and a less stringent LCR (“modified LCR”) for BHCs with less than $250 billion in total assets, such as the Company. The LCR requires a banking entity to maintain sufficient liquidity to withstand an acute 30-day liquidity stress scenario. The LCR became effective for the Company on January 1, 2016, with a minimum requirement of 90% of high-quality, liquid assets to total net cash outflows; full compliance of 100% was required beginning January 1, 2017. The Company has met LCR requirements within the regulatory timelines and at December 31, 2017, its LCR was above the 100% regulatory requirement.
On December 19, 2016, the FRB published the final rule, promulgated as Regulation WW, which will require us to publicly disclose qualitative information, with certain 


qualifications and permitted limitations related to information that is proprietary or confidential to the Company, about (i) certain components of our LCR calculation in a standardized tabular format (LCR disclosure template) and (ii) factors that have significant effect on the LCR, to facilitate an understanding of our calculations and results. The rule aims to promote market discipline by providing the public with comparable liquidity information about covered companies. The disclosures must be made on a covered company's public internet site or in a public financial or regulatory report. The disclosures must remain available to the public for at least five years from the time of initial disclosure. Covered companies subject to modified LCR, including the Company, will be required to comply with disclosure requirements beginning on October 1, 2018.
On May 3, 2016, the FRB, OCC, and the FDIC proposed a rule to implement the NSFR. The proposal would require large U.S. banking organizations to maintain a stable funding profile over a one-year horizon. The FRB proposed a modified NSFR requirement for bank holding companies with greater than $50 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion in total on balance sheet foreign exposure. As proposed, the rule would require us to publicly disclose our NSFR and the components of the NSFR each calendar quarter. The agencies intend the NSFR to complement the LCR, liquidity risk management, and stress testing requirements under the FRB's Regulation YY (enhanced prudential standards for BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more). The proposed rule contains an implementation date of January 1, 2018; however, a final rule has not yet been issued.
See additional discussion of the LCR and NSFR in the "Liquidity Risk Management" section of Item 7, MD&A, in this Form 10-K. 
Capital Planning; Stress Testing
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, BHCs are required to conduct company-run stress tests and to perform supervisory stress tests directed by the FRB. BHCs with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets must conduct an annual company-run stress test, and those with total consolidated assets exceeding $50 billion must conduct an additional mid-cycle stress test. For company-run stress tests, BHCs use the same planning horizon, capital action assumptions, and scenarios as those used in the supervisory stress tests. Stress testing is designed to assess whether the covered Company's capital is sufficient to absorb losses during stressful conditions, while meeting obligations to creditors and counterparties, and, to the extent applicable, continuing to serve as credit intermediaries. 
The Company also is subject to supervisory stress testing requirements under the FRB's Capital Plan Rule, which the FRB implements as part of its CCAR process. CCAR is a broad supervisory program that includes stress testing and assesses a covered company’s practices for determining capital needs, including its risk measurement and management practices, capital planning and decision-making, and associated internal controls and governance. The Company is required to publish a summary of the results of its annual stress test, and the FRB publishes the results of the stress testing under adverse and severely adverse scenarios. 


2

The Capital Plan Rule finalized in late 2011 requires a U.S. BHC with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to develop and maintain a capital plan that is reviewed and approved by its board of directors or a committee thereof. Capital plans are intended to allow the FRB to assess the BHC’s systems and processes of incorporating forward-looking projections of assets and liabilities, revenues and losses, and to monitor and maintain their internal capital adequacy. Under the Capital Plan Rule, each capital plan must address, among other capital actions, projected capital ratios under stress scenarios, planned dividends and other capital distributions, and share repurchases over a minimum nine quarter planning horizon. Prior to executing a capital plan, a non-objection notification must be received from the FRB. If the FRB objects to our capital plan, we may not make certain capital distributions until the FRB's non-objection to the distribution is received.
In January 2017, the FRB released a final rule that revises capital plan and stress test rules, whereby certain BHCs, including the Company, with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets will no longer be subject to the qualitative component of the FRB’s annual CCAR. The final rule also modifies certain regulatory reports to collect additional information on nonbank assets and to reduce reporting burdens for large and noncomplex firms. 
For additional information regarding Capital Planning and Stress Testing, refer to the "Capital Resources" section of Item 7, MD&A, in this Form 10-K.
Regulatory Regime for Swaps
The Dodd-Frank Act established a new comprehensive regulatory regime for the OTC swaps market, aimed at increasing transparency and reducing systemic risk in the derivatives markets, including requirements for central clearing, exchange trading, capital, margin, reporting, and recordkeeping. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that certain swap dealers register with one or both of the SEC and CFTC, depending on the nature of the swaps business. The Bank provisionally registered with the CFTC as a swaps dealer, subjecting the Bank to new requirements under this regulatory regime including trade reporting and record keeping requirements, business conduct requirements (including daily valuations, disclosure of material risks associated with swaps and disclosure of material incentives and conflicts of interest), mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements for certain standardized swaps designated by the CFTC, and increased capital requirements established by the FRB. Subject to the SEC's finalization of certain rules applicable to security-based swaps, the Bank expects to register with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer. Such registration will subject the Bank’s security-based swaps business to similar Dodd-Frank Act requirements, including trade reporting, business conduct standards, recordkeeping, and potentially mandatory clearing and exchange requirements. In 2020, our derivatives business involving uncleared swaps is expected to become subject to margin requirements established by the FRB, which may exceed current market practice.
Resolution Planning
BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must submit resolution plans to the FRB and FDIC addressing the 


company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in case of material financial distress or failure. 
The FRB and FDIC have widely promoted resolution plans as core elements of reforms intended to mitigate risks to the U.S. financial system, and to end the “too big to fail” status of the largest financial institutions. Covered institutions are expected to file their resolution plans annually, or at the direction of regulators, regardless of the financial condition or nature of operations of the institution. Preparation and review of these resolution plans is a major undertaking for covered financial institutions. If a plan is not credible, the Company and the Bank may be restricted in expansionary activities, or be subjected to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements. The Company and the Bank submitted resolution plans to the FRB and FDIC in December 2015. During 2016, the FRB and FDIC waived the covered financial institutions' requirement to file their resolution plans. The FRB and FDIC provided feedback regarding the Company's and the Bank's 2015 resolution plans during 2017. The Company submitted its updated resolution plan to the FRB in December 2017. The Bank is developing its resolution plan to be responsive to feedback received and will submit its plan to the FDIC in 2018.
The FDIC issued a final rule in November 2016 requiring insured depository institutions with more than two million deposit accounts to create and maintain comprehensive and detailed deposit account records to facilitate the determination of FDIC insured deposits in the event of a bank failure. Under the rule, the FDIC must be able to use the failing bank's systems, data, and staff to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each depositor and place holds on portions of uninsured deposits. The Bank will be required to be in compliance with this rule by May 2020.
Deposit Insurance 
The Bank’s depositors are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits, which is currently $250,000 per account ownership type. The FDIC provides deposit insurance through the DIF, which the FDIC maintains by assessing depository institutions, including the Bank, an insurance premium. The Dodd-Frank Act changed the statutory regime governing the DIF. By September 30, 2020, the FDIC must increase the amount in the deposit insurance fund to 1.35% of insured deposits, impose a premium on banks to reach this goal, and offset the effect of assessment increases for institutions with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. In March 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule to address this surcharge on banks by collecting those premiums from banks with more than $10 billion in consolidated assets. This surcharge began in the third quarter of 2016.
Source of Strength
FRB policy requires BHCs to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support each subsidiary. This policy was codified in the Dodd-Frank Act, though no regulations have been proposed to define the scope of this financial support.
Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”), PATRIOT ACT; OFAC Sanctions
Anti-money laundering measures and economic sanctions have 


3

long been a matter of regulatory focus in the U.S. The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, commonly referred to as the "Bank Secrecy Act" or "BSA," requires U.S. financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering by imposing various reporting and recordkeeping requirements on financial institutions. Passage of the Patriot Act renewed and expanded this focus, extending greatly the breadth and depth of anti-money laundering measures required under the BSA. The Patriot Act requires all financial institutions to establish certain anti-money laundering compliance and due diligence programs, including enhanced due diligence policies, procedures, and controls for certain types of relationships deemed to pose heightened risks. In cooperation with federal banking regulatory agencies, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN") is responsible for implementing, administering, and enforcing BSA compliance.
Federal banking regulators and FinCEN continue to emphasize their expectation that financial institutions establish and implement robust BSA/AML compliance programs. Consistent with this supervisory emphasis, in August 2014, FinCEN issued an advisory stressing its expectations for financial institutions’ BSA/AML compliance programs, including specific governance, staffing and resource allocation, and testing and monitoring requirements. Furthermore, FinCEN proposed a rule that would require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information from all legal entities with which they conduct business.
OFAC has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing economic and trade sanctions, which are broad-based measures, derived from U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives. These sanctions are imposed on designated foreign countries and persons, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, and persons involved in activities relating to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. While the sanctions laws are separate from the BSA and AML laws, these regimes overlap in purpose. All U.S. persons must comply with U.S. sanctions laws. The Company must ensure that its operations, including its provision of services to clients, are designed to ensure compliance with U.S. sanctions laws. Among other things, the Company must block accounts of, and transactions with, sanctioned persons and report blocked transactions after their occurrence.
Over the past several years, federal banking regulators, FinCEN, and OFAC have increased supervisory and enforcement attention on U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, as evidenced by a significant increase in enforcement activity, including several high profile enforcement actions. Several of these actions have addressed violations of AML laws, U.S. sanctions laws, or both, resulting in the imposition of substantial civil monetary penalties. In both the BSA/AML and sanctions areas, enforcement actions have increasingly focused on publicly identifying individuals and holding those individuals, including compliance officers, accountable for deficiencies in BSA/AML compliance programs. State attorneys general and the DOJ have also pursued enforcement actions against banking entities alleged to have willfully violated AML and U.S. sanctions laws. 


Consumer Financial Protection
The CFPB, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, has broad rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. Furthermore, the CFPB is authorized to engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data, and promote the availability of financial services to under-served consumers and communities. The CFPB has primary examination and enforcement authority over institutions with assets of $10 billion or more. We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, and these laws’ respective state-law counterparts. The Company also is subject to state laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution, and attorneys’ fees. In addition, federal bank regulators, state attorneys general, and state and local consumer protection agencies may pursue remedies, such as imposition of regulatory sanctions and penalties, restrictions on expansionary activities, and requiring customer rescission rights. 
Prompt Corrective Action
The federal banking agencies have broad powers with which to require companies to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The law establishes five capital categories for this purpose: (i) well-capitalized, (ii) adequately capitalized, (iii) undercapitalized, (iv) significantly undercapitalized, and (v) critically undercapitalized. The Capital Rules amended the thresholds in the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the higher capital ratios required in the Capital Rules. Under the Capital Rules, to be considered well-capitalized, an institution generally must have risk-based Total capital and Tier 1 capital ratios of at least 10% and 6%, respectively, and must not be subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. While the prompt corrective action rules apply to banks and not BHCs, the FRB is authorized to take actions at the holding company level. The banking regulatory agencies are required to take mandatory supervisory actions, and have the discretion to take other actions, as to insured depository institutions in the three undercapitalized categories, the severity of which depends on the assigned capital category. For example, an insured depository institution is generally prohibited from paying dividends or making capital distributions if it would be undercapitalized as a result. An undercapitalized institution must submit a capital restoration plan, which must be guaranteed up to certain amounts by its parent holding company. Significantly undercapitalized institutions may be subject to various requirements and restrictions, such as mandates to sell voting stock, reduce total assets, and limit or prohibit the receipt of correspondent bank deposits. Critically undercapitalized 


4

institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator.
Volcker Rule
Through the “Volcker Rule,” the Dodd-Frank Act amends the BHC Act by generally prohibiting a banking entity from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in, sponsoring, or having certain other relationships with, a private equity, hedge fund, or certain other types of private funds. The term “banking entity” covers insured depository institutions, their holding companies, and certain other entities and their affiliates. There are limited exceptions to the prohibition on proprietary trading, such as trading in certain U.S. government or agency securities, engaging in certain underwriting or market-making activities, and certain hedging activities. There are also limited exceptions to the prohibitions on certain activities with covered private funds, such as for certain activities in connection with a banking entity's bona fide trust, fiduciary, or investment advisory business, as well as in connection with public welfare activities including low income housing finance. All permitted activities are subject to applicable federal or state laws, restrictions or limitations that may be imposed by the regulator, including capital and quantitative limitations as well as diversification requirements, and must not, among other things, pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or the financial stability of the U.S. Further, the Volcker Rule's anti-evasion authority grant to the regulatory agencies requires them to impose extensive internal controls and recordkeeping requirements on banking organizations to ensure their compliance with the Volcker Rule.
Branching
The Dodd-Frank Act relaxed existing interstate branching restrictions by modifying the federal statute governing de novo interstate branching by state member banks. Consequently, a state member bank may open its initial branch in a state outside of the bank’s home state by way of an interstate bank branch, so long as a bank chartered under the laws of that state would be permitted to open a branch at that location.
Restrictions on Affiliate Transactions
There are limits and restrictions on transactions in which the Bank and its subsidiaries may engage with the Company and other Company subsidiaries. Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and FRB's Regulation W, among other things, govern terms and conditions and limit the amount of extensions of credit, and the amount of collateral required to secure extensions of credit, by the Bank and its subsidiaries to the Company and other Company subsidiaries, and limit purchases of assets by the Bank and its subsidiaries from the Company and other Company subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly enhanced and expanded the scope and coverage of the limitations imposed by Sections 23A and 23B, specifically, by including derivative transactions as credit extensions subject to Section 23A and 23B. Furthermore, the Dodd-Frank Act requires that conforming collateral be maintained for the duration of covered transactions, rather than only at the time of the transaction. The FRB has increased its scrutiny of Regulation W transactions, and has supported its supervision over 


Regulation W compliance with information received through the resolution planning process. The FRB has yet to amend Regulation W or provide guidance in light of the Dodd-Frank Act's changes to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act.
Interchange Rules; “Durbin Amendment”
The Dodd-Frank Act, through a provision known as the “Durbin Amendment,” required the FRB to establish a cap on the interchange fees that merchants pay banks for electronic clearing of debit transactions. In 2011, the FRB issued final rules that significantly limit the amount of interchange fees a bank may charge for electronic debit transactions.
Incentive Compensation
In 2010, the FRB and other regulators jointly published final guidance for structuring incentive compensation arrangements at financial organizations. The guidance does not set forth any formulas or pay caps but contains certain principles that companies are required to follow with respect to employees and groups of employees that may expose the company to material amounts of risk. The three primary principles are (i) balanced risk-taking incentives, (ii) compatibility with effective controls and risk management, and (iii) strong corporate governance. The FRB monitors compliance with this guidance as part of its safety and soundness oversight.
In 2016, the FRB, SEC, and other regulators jointly published proposed rules on incentive compensation under Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The proposed rules would impose several substantive requirements on the form of our incentive compensation, including (i) requiring that incentive compensation payable to a “senior executive officer” or “significant-risk taker” be subject to a 7-year clawback requirement; (ii) requiring a substantial portion of incentive compensation payable to a “senior executive officer” or “significant-risk taker” to be deferred and subject to the risk of forfeiture; (iii) prohibiting the acceleration of incentive compensation that is required to be deferred, other than in the event of death or disability; (iv) limiting the amount of incentive compensation payable to “senior executive officers” and “significant risk-takers” for the attainment of performance measures in excess of target measures (to 125% and 150% of target for “senior executive officers” and “significant risk-takers,” respectively); and (v) requiring the implementation of an independent risk-monitoring framework. In July 2017, the SEC released its rulemaking agenda and did not include the rules under Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, it is not certain when the final rules may be issued.
Privacy and Cyber-Security
We are subject to many U.S. federal, state, and international laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures to protect non-public confidential information of our customers. The GLBA requires us to periodically disclose our privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and permits consumers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. Other laws and regulations, at both the federal and state level, impact our ability to share certain information 


5

with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. The GLBA also requires banking institutions to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. These security and privacy policies and procedures, for the protection of personal and confidential information, are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations. 
Acquisitions
Our ability to grow through acquisitions is limited by various regulatory approval requirements. The FRB's prior approval is required if we wish to (i) acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank, (ii) acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of any bank or thrift, or (iii) merge or consolidate with any other BHC.
Pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies from any state may acquire banks located in any other state, subject to certain conditions, including concentration limits. Additionally, the BHC Act enumerates the factors the FRB must consider when reviewing the merger of BHCs, the acquisition of banks, or the acquisition of voting securities of a bank or BHC. These factors include the competitive effects of the proposal in the relevant geographic markets, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and banks involved in the transaction, the effect of the transaction on the financial stability of the U.S., the organizations’ compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, and the records of performance, under the CRA, of the insured depository institutions involved in the transaction. In addition, in cases involving interstate bank acquisitions, the FRB must consider the concentration of deposits nationwide and in certain individual states. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a BHC is generally prohibited from merging, consolidating with, or acquiring, another company if the resulting company’s liabilities upon consummation would exceed 10% of the aggregate liabilities of the U.S. financial sector, including the U.S. liabilities of foreign financial companies.
Competition
We face competition from domestic and foreign lending institutions and numerous other providers of financial services. The Company competes using a client-centered model that focuses on working together as OneTeam to deliver high quality service, while offering a broad range of products and services. We believe this approach better positions us to increase loyalty and deepen existing relationships, while also attracting new customers. Furthermore, the Company maintains a strong presence within high-growth Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states, thereby enhancing its competitive position. While we believe the Company is well positioned within the highly competitive financial services industry, the industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, economic, and technological changes, as well as continued consolidation. The ability of non-banking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified 


competition. Because non-banking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and with lower cost and capital structures. However, non-banking financial institutions may not have the same access to deposit funds or government programs and, as a result, those non-banking financial institutions may elect, as some have done, to become financial holding companies to gain such access. Securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions, which could further alter the competitive environment in which we conduct business.
Employees
At December 31, 2017, the Company had 23,785 full-time equivalent employees. None of the domestic employees within the Company are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Management considers its employee relations to be in good standing.
