ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

As used herein, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” means Toys “R” Us, Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries, except as expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31 of each calendar year. This Annual Report on Form 10-K focuses on our last three fiscal years ended as follows: fiscal 2016 ended January 28, 2017; fiscal 2015 ended January 30, 2016; and fiscal 2014 ended January 31, 2015. References to 2016, 2015 and 2014 are to our fiscal years unless otherwise specified.
Overview
We are relentlessly striving to be the best toy and baby products retail company for the world! Our purpose is to put huge smiles on the faces of children of all ages by being the world’s greatest toy store and to make it easier for parents to make the best possible choices as they care for their babies.
We are the leading global specialty retailer of toys and baby products as measured by Net sales. We believe our Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us brands are recognized as the toy and baby authority. We sell a variety of products in the baby, core toy, entertainment, learning and seasonal categories through our omnichannel offerings that leverage the synergies between our brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce.
As of January 28, 2017, we operated 1,691 stores and licensed an additional 257 stores, which are located in 38 countries and jurisdictions around the world. We operate our stores under the Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us banners and also have smaller format Toys “R” Us Outlet stores (“Outlet”) and Toys “R” Us Express stores (“Express”).  Our omnichannel presence includes our Toysrus.com and Babiesrus.com sites, as well as other e-commerce sites in our international markets. For fiscal 2016, we generated Net sales of $11,540 million, resulting in Net loss attributable to Toys “R” Us, Inc. of $36 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $792 million. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, an explanation of why we present it and a description of the limitations of this non-GAAP measure, as well as a reconciliation to Net loss attributable to Toys “R” Us, Inc., refer to Item 6 entitled “SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our History
Our Company was founded in Washington D.C. in 1948 when Charles Lazarus opened a baby furniture store, Children’s Bargain Town. The Toys “R” Us name made its debut in 1957. In 1978, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock. When Charles Lazarus retired as our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) in 1994, we operated or licensed over 1,000 stores in 17 countries and jurisdictions. In 1996, we established the Babies “R” Us brand, further solidifying our reputation as a leading retail destination for children of all ages and their families.
On July 21, 2005, we were acquired by an investment group led by entities advised by or affiliated with Bain Capital Private Equity, L.P., Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., and Vornado Realty Trust. We refer to this collective ownership group as our “Sponsors.” Upon the completion of this acquisition, we became a private company.
Leadership and Strategy
Since joining the Company in 2015, David A. Brandon, CEO and Chairman of the Board, has further strengthened our senior leadership team with a number of key hires across a broad range of disciplines, including communications, information technology, legal, marketing and operations. These hires, along with existing management, provide us with a fresh perspective on the business and bring with them a wealth of relevant experience and knowledge in leading key areas of our business.
Our Company has outlined the following key strategic growth initiatives, which we refer to as our “Strategic Pillars:”

• | Make Talent and Culture a Competitive Advantage. Create a culture of high performance, responsiveness and agility. 


• | Grow and Build the Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us Brands Throughout the World. Invest in our existing stores and e-commerce platforms and continue to grow our brands globally. 


• | Create a World Class Experience for Our Customers - Innovate and Lead. Develop empowered teams that strive for flawless execution in every aspect of the in-store and omnichannel experience. 


• | Create a Strong Financial Foundation. Continue to drive cost savings while we transition to our growth phase.

Our Strengths
Strong Brand Equity
Our brand names are highly recognized in North America, Europe and Asia, and our expertise in the toy and baby products retail space, substantial scale and geographic footprint and strong vendor relationships account for our market-leading position and distinguish us from the competition. We believe we offer our customers the most comprehensive year-round selection of merchandise in the retail toy and baby categories through our “R” Us branded brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce business. We seek to further differentiate ourselves from our competitors in several key areas, including our omnichannel presence, broad product assortment, private label and exclusively licensed product offerings and expert service which enables us to command a reputation as the shopping destination for toys and baby products.
Customer Experience
Every day we strive to improve the customer experience in our stores and online. This enables us to bring joy into the lives of our customers by being the toy and baby authority and definitive destination for kid fun, gift-giving solutions and parenting services. Compared with multi-line mass merchandisers, we believe we are able to provide more knowledgeable service to our customers through our highly trained sales force. We train our store team members to deepen their product knowledge and enhance their targeted selling skills in order to improve customer service.
To better leverage our physical presence, we are improving the shopping experience by bringing our stores to life. We have added feature shops in our stores that highlight several of our beacon brands, hot trends and featured movie properties, with larger than life graphic displays. Additionally, we are making our toy stores more interactive to engage kids and families. We are inviting customers to in-store events that offer free build-and-take toys, collect-and-trade days and toy demonstrations. Our Geoffrey’s Birthday Club was re-launched with in-store birthday celebrations for families to enjoy story time and meet Geoffrey himself. During the 2016 holidays, Babies “R” Us stores held a “Baby’s First Christmas” event and we offered professional Santa photo packages in select U.S. Toys “R” Us stores.
To improve shop-ability, our feature shops at the front of our toy stores are designed to help customers easily find what they’re looking for - a “Here’s What’s Hot Shop” with the hottest and trending toys in one convenient location and our “Gift Express” shop featuring grab-and-go gifts for $30 or less. Select U.S. stores are equipped with navigation, including digital store-specific maps to help customers pinpoint the location of the items they are looking for by using their smartphone on a navigational sign at the entrance to our stores. In addition, some of our Babies “R” Us store employees are equipped with tablets to help customers choose the perfect item from our webstore and order right on the spot. We are continuing to invest in our store appearance as part of our “Clean and Bright” initiative and enhance the customer experience by maintaining stronger in-stock positions in our stores and online for the hottest toys at competitive prices.
For the added convenience of our customers, we offer a layaway program and provide a home delivery service. Our “Price Match Guarantee” program matches competitors’ in-store and selected online retailer pricing on identical items.

E-Commerce and Omnichannel
Over the past several years, we have driven growth in our e-commerce business, particularly within our omnichannel programs. For fiscal 2016, our consolidated e-commerce business generated net sales of $1,495 million, 41% of which was contributed by our omnichannel programs. The chart below shows our e-commerce net sales growth with the percentage of omnichannel fulfillment for the past five fiscal years:
($ In millions)
Our omnichannel capabilities through which we integrate our e-commerce and brick-and-mortar stores include the following:

• | Buy Online, Pick Up In Store. Available within all stores in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Germany. Offers customers the ability to browse and shop online and pick up their purchases in-store in as little as one hour. 


• | Ship to Store. Allows customers in the United States to purchase items online that may not be currently available in their local store, and have their order delivered to the local store of their choice, free of shipping charges. 


• | Ship from Store. Leverages inventory from our U.S. stores to improve the speed with which customers receive their online orders, as well as provide an additional option to fulfill these orders. This feature is also available in several of our international markets. 


• | Pay In Store. Provides customers the flexibility to shop online and pay for their items in any store across the United States. 

We are currently working towards the launch of our new Domestic e-commerce platform later in 2017 to transform and modernize our digital space. We aim to significantly improve the customer experience online and better integrate our omnichannel presence. We believe that this will provide us the flexibility needed to grow and allow us to respond to changing customer dynamics in an ever competitive marketplace. Over the past year, we have made improvements to our omnichannel fulfillment capacity, particularly through Ship from Store and improved staffing and training programs at our distribution centers, to meet peak demand during the holidays. In addition, our low everyday free shipping purchase minimum in the U.S. at Toysrus.com and Babiesrus.com is competitive in the marketplace.
Internationally, we have an online presence in 19 countries and jurisdictions, which includes Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Kingdom, as well as in several of our licensed markets.

International Store Portfolio Expansion
We believe that we have the potential to continue to grow the number of stores internationally, particularly those in the emerging markets which are seeing overall GDP growth. Our first licensed store in China opened in 2006 through our partnership with Fung Retailing. In fiscal 2011, the Company acquired a 70% ownership interest in Toys (Labuan) Holding Limited (“Asia JV”) from Fung Retailing, which included locations in Brunei, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand, consisting of 90 operating stores. Since the acquisition of Asia JV, we have more than doubled our store count and now operate 226 Toys “R” Us retail stores as of January 28, 2017. Our International segment operating store portfolio has grown by 22% since fiscal 2012:
Our licensed store base has also continued to expand as we identify opportunities in markets where we do not already have a physical store presence.  As of January 28, 2017, we licensed 257 stores in 19 countries and jurisdictions, generating $18 million in licensing revenue.
Customer Loyalty Programs and Marketing
Domestically, we provide several programs that benefit customers throughout the year including:
Rewards “R” Us. With 19 million current active members, we believe this loyalty program results in an improved customer shopping experience and more frequent visits to our stores and online sites. In fiscal 2016, our valued loyalty members contributed approximately two-thirds of our Domestic Net sales and benefited from the program’s rewards and promotions. Members earn $5 for every $125 spent, with “R” Us credit cardholders earning double the rewards for every $1 spent. Through this program we offer a variety of exclusive one-time and ongoing benefits, deals and promotions to our customers, and allow them to earn and redeem points at our stores and online. This includes Bonus Points days, Black Friday previews, credit card promotions and eligibility to our Endless Earnings and Geoffrey’s Birthday Club programs.
Babies “R” Us Registry. Our baby business offers a broad range of baby products and delivers a high level of customer service and product knowledge to our customers.  We provide a baby product assortment that draws new and repeat customers to our Baby Registry Program, with over 23 million registrants since inception. Our Baby Registry program is important to building our baby business. Establishing first contact with new parents enables us to develop long-lasting customer relationships as their children grow and they transition to our full portfolio of products. We have made several enhancements to our Baby Registry program to improve the shopping experience for expectant and new parents including: 

• | A Registry mobile app that allows customers to manage their baby registry anytime, from anywhere.


• | The Endless Earnings program where domestically, expectant parents receive 5% rewards on the first $300 in purchases and 10% on every purchase thereafter with no limits, encouraging parents to use their registry as their ultimate shopping list that pays them back.


• | Innovative programs, classes and expert services for expectant and new parents, which include monthly in store events and exclusive offers for registrants.

Much like our Rewards “R” Us program in the U.S., we have over 12 million active members in similar loyalty programs around the world. In addition, we offer the following to our customers:

• | Wish List. Allows parents and kids to create a tailored list of desired toys that gift-givers can utilize to make their purchases. 


• | Geoffrey’s Birthday Club. Parents receive exciting offers to help prepare for their child’s birthday and kids are invited to our stores to receive special gifts and meet Geoffrey the Giraffe. 


• | “R” Us Credit Card. We offer co-branded and private label credit cards which allows customers to finance purchases at our stores, online and at other businesses, and receive loyalty benefits, deals and promotions in exchange.

We believe that we have achieved our leading market position largely as a result of, building highly recognized brand names, year-round breadth of product offerings, knowledgeable employees and strong loyalty programs. We use a variety of broad-based and targeted marketing and advertising strategies to reach consumers and to try to connect with our customers on a personal level. These strategies include targeted advertisements and mass marketing programs such as e-mail marketing, digital and social media, direct mail, national television and radio spots, catalogs inserts in national and local newspapers, direct mailings to loyalty program members and in-store marketing. We continue to transition a significant portion of our marketing reach in an effort to optimize our digital versus traditional media mix. Our most significant single piece of advertising in the U.S. is “The Great Big Toys “R” Us Book of Awesome” promotional catalog release, which is distributed through direct mail, newspapers and our stores in advance of the holiday selling season.
Inventory Management
We continue to focus on enhancing the customer experience by improving our in-stock position to ensure we have the hot products that customers are looking for, while at the same time maintaining healthy inventory levels. Additionally, our product life cycle management process continues to help reduce clearance margin risk by instituting greater discipline around product exit dates.
Vendor Relationships
We view our well-established vendor relationships as a core strength of the organization and continue to build these partnerships in the hopes of growing together.  We provide our vendors with a year-round platform to showcase their brands and test their new products in our stores.  In return, we obtain greater access to products in demand, exclusive products and support for advertising and marketing efforts to drive category leadership and differentiation. We additionally have strategic partnerships with American Girl® and Claire’s which are featured as branded shops within select Toys “R” Us stores.
Our Stores
As of January 28, 2017, we operated and licensed retail stores worldwide in the following formats:

Store Type | Store Count | Typical Square Footage
Operated: | | 
Traditional Toy (1) | 932 | | 20,000 - 50,000
Side-By-Side (“SBS”) (2) | 420 | | 30,000 - 70,000
Baby (3) | 237 | | 30,000 - 55,000
Long-Term Express | 64 | | 3,000 - 7,000 
Outlet | 38 | | 3,000 - 5,000 
Total Operated Stores | 1,691 | | 
Licensed (4) | 257 | | Various 


(1) | Devote on average 5,000 square feet to boutique areas for baby products.


(2) | Devote 20,000 to 40,000 square feet to traditional toy products and 10,000 to 30,000 square feet to baby products.


(3) | Devote 3,000 square feet to traditional toy products and includes our Babies “R” Us flagship store in Union Square, New York City.


(4) | “R” Us branded retail stores. Licensing revenue did not have a material impact on Net sales. 

Globally, our store portfolio includes smaller format Express stores located in malls and shopping centers. During the 2016 holiday season, we operated 126 Express stores, of which 103 were still open as of January 28, 2017. Of the 103 Express stores that remained open, 64 have been included in our overall store count as they each have a cumulative lease term of at least two years (“Long-Term Express”). The remaining 39 Express stores are considered temporary stores (“Temporary Express”). These locations typically range in size from 3,000 to 7,000 square feet each, have a cumulative lease term of less than two years and are not included in our overall store count.
Additionally, we operated 38 Outlets within our Domestic segment, 12 of which opened in fiscal 2016. These permanent stores are located in high traffic shopping and lifestyle centers, have traditional toy product assortments as well as unique discount items and typically have lease terms of at least five years.

Our extensive experience in retail site selection has resulted in a portfolio of stores that includes attractive locations in many of our chosen markets. Markets for new stores and formats are selected on the basis of proximity to other “R” Us branded stores, demographic factors, population growth potential, competitive environment, availability of real estate and cost. Once a potential market is identified, we select a suitable location based upon several criteria, including size of the property, access to major commercial thoroughfares, proximity of other strong anchor stores, visibility and parking capacity.
Our Business Segments
Our business has two reportable segments: Toys “R” Us – Domestic (“Domestic”) and Toys “R” Us – International (“International”). Refer to Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements entitled “SEGMENTS” for our segments’ financial results. The following is a brief description of our segments:

• | Domestic — Our Domestic segment sells a variety of products through 879 stores that operate in 49 states in the United States, Puerto Rico and Guam and through e-commerce. As of January 28, 2017, our Domestic stores consisted of 358 traditional toy stores, 223 baby stores, 212 SBS stores, 48 Long-Term Express stores and 38 Outlets, as well as Temporary Express locations. Domestic Net sales were $7,131 million for fiscal 2016, which accounted for 62% of our consolidated Net sales. 


• | International — Our International segment sells a variety of products through 812 operated and 257 licensed stores in 37 countries and jurisdictions and through e-commerce. As of January 28, 2017, our International stores consisted of 574 traditional toy stores, 208 SBS stores, 16 Long-Term Express stores and 14 baby stores, as well as Temporary Express locations. International Net sales were $4,409 million for fiscal 2016, which accounted for 38% of our consolidated Net sales. 

Product Selection and Merchandise
Our product offerings are focused on serving the needs of parents, grandparents and other gift-givers interested in purchasing merchandise in our primary product categories:

• | Baby — focused on serving newborns and children up to four years of age by offering a broad array of products, such as baby gear, consumables, infant care products, apparel, furniture, bedding and room décor; many of these items are available in toy and baby stores;


• | Core Toy — boys and girls toys, such as action figures, dolls and doll accessories, drones, role play toys and vehicles;


• | Entertainment — video game software, systems and accessories, tablets, portable electronics and other related products;


• | Learning — educational electronics and developmental toys, such as our Imaginarium products in the United States and World of Imagination products at our International locations, construction toys, games, creative activities and pre-school merchandise which includes learning products, activities and toys; and


• | Seasonal — toys and other products geared toward holidays (including Christmas, Hanukkah, Three Kings, Chinese New Year, Carnival, Easter, Children’s Day, Golden Week and Halloween) and summer activities, as well as bikes, sports toys, play sets and other outdoor products.

We offer a wide selection of popular national toy and baby brands including many products that are exclusively offered at, or launched at, our stores. Over the past few years, we have worked with key vendors to obtain exclusive products and expand our private label brands enabling us to earn higher margins and offer products that our customers will not find elsewhere. We offer a broad selection of private label merchandise under names such as BABIES “R” US, IMAGINARIUM, KOALA BABY, AVIGO, FAST LANE, YOU & ME, JUST LIKE HOME, BRUIN, STATS, JOURNEY GIRLS, ANIMAL PLANET, TRUE HEROES, SIZZLIN’ COOL, EDU-SCIENCE, PAVILION, DREAM DAZZLERS and TOTALLY ME! in our stores. We believe these private label brands provide a platform on which we can expand our product offerings in the future and will further differentiate our products and allow us to enhance profitability. Our private label penetration rate was 12% of Net sales in fiscal 2016. We utilize our sourcing office in China to work with our vendors and differentiate our product offerings.
Safety Focus
We believe that we have put in place product safety standards that meet or exceed United States federally mandated and/or global regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate. In addition, through our dedicated safety website, safety boards in stores, social media and e-mail communications and partnerships with safety organizations including the Consumer Products Safety Commission, we provide resources for customers, parents and others to help ensure they have the most up-to-date information on product safety and recalls.

Corporate Philanthropy and Community Service
We are proud to have a long tradition at Toys “R” Us of supporting numerous children’s charities. Over the past three decades, the Company has given more than $100 million in product donations to children’s charities. In addition, the Toys “R” Us Children’s Fund Inc., a public charity affiliated with the Company, has donated more than $130 million in grants to children’s charities that keep children safe and help them in times of need. We actively support charities such as the Marine Toys for Tots Foundation, Make-A-Wish America, Special Olympics, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and Save the Children, among others. We encourage our employees to become active in charitable endeavors by matching contributions they make to qualified charities of their choice, and through Volunteer Match, a program that helps them identify charities to assist in their communities. We also manage the Geoffrey Fund, Inc., a non-profit organization that provides assistance to employees affected by natural and personal disasters. The Geoffrey Fund relies on donations from employees to carry out its mission.
Market and Competition
In the domestic market, we compete with mass merchandisers, such as Walmart, Target and Kmart; consumer electronics retailers, such as Best Buy and GameStop; Internet and catalog businesses, such as Amazon.com; national and regional specialty, department and discount store chains; as well as local retailers in the geographic areas we serve. Our baby registry competes with baby registries of mass merchandisers, other specialty retail formats, such as buybuy BABY, and regional retailers. In the International toy and electronics markets, we compete with mass merchandisers, discounters and specialty retailers. The domestic and international mass merchandisers and discounters aggressively price items in the traditional toy and electronic product categories with larger dedicated selling space during the holiday season in order to build traffic for other store departments.
We believe the principal competitive factors in the toy, including video game products, and baby products markets are product variety, price, quality, availability, advertising and promotion, convenience or store location, shipping offers, safety and customer support and service. We believe we are able to effectively compete by providing a broader range of merchandise, strong in-stock positions, convenient locations, knowledgeable customer service and competitive pricing and shipping offers.
Seasonality
Our global business is highly seasonal with sales and earnings highest in the fourth quarter due to the fourth quarter holiday selling season. During fiscals 2016, 2015 and 2014, 40%, 41% and 40%, respectively, of our total Net sales were generated in the fourth quarter. We typically incur net losses in each of the first three quarters of the year, with a substantial portion of our operating earnings generated in the fourth quarter. We seek to continuously improve our ability to manage the numerous demands of a highly seasonal business, from the areas of product sourcing and distribution, to the challenges of delivering high sales volumes and excellent customer service during peak business periods. For more than 65 years, we have developed substantial experience and expertise in managing the increased demand during the holiday season which we believe favorably differentiates us from our competition.
License Agreements
We have license agreements with unaffiliated third party operators located outside the United States. The agreements are largely structured with royalty income paid as a percentage of sales for the use of our trademarks, trade name and branding. Licensing revenue was $18 million for fiscal 2016 and $17 million for fiscals 2015 and 2014, respectively. While this business format remains a small piece of our overall International business operations, we continue to look for opportunities for market expansion. Our preferred approach is to open stores in our Company-operated format, but we may choose partnerships or licensed arrangements where we believe it is appropriate due to business climate and risks.

Employees
As of January 28, 2017, we employed 64,000 full-time and part-time individuals worldwide, with 36,000 domestically and 28,000 internationally. These numbers do not include the individuals employed by licensees of our stores. Due to the 
9

seasonality of our business, we employed 107,000 full-time and part-time employees worldwide during the 2016 holiday season.
Distribution
We operate 18 distribution centers including 8 that support our Domestic operations and 10 that support our International operations (excluding licensed operations). These distribution centers employ warehouse management systems and material handling equipment that help to manage overall inventory levels and distribution costs. In fiscal 2015, we opened a state-of-the-art distribution center in France which integrates our three previous fulfillment centers and serves as the headquarters office for Toys “R” Us, France. We believe that this facility creates greater operational efficiencies for our business, while allowing us to better serve our customers through our growing omnichannel capabilities in Europe.
We have agreements with third party logistics providers JB Hunt Transport, Inc. and Performance Team Freight Systems, Inc. to manage all services related to the delivery of inventory from our distribution centers to our U.S. stores. We believe the flexibility afforded by our warehouse/distribution system and the utilization of third party providers to distribute merchandise provides us with operating efficiencies and the ability to maintain a superior in-stock inventory position at our stores.
We also have an agreement with DHL Supply Chain (formerly Exel, Inc.), a leading North American contract logistics provider, who provides additional warehousing and fulfillment services for our e-commerce operations in the United States. We utilize various third party providers who furnish similar services in our international markets.
We continuously seek to improve our global supply chain management, optimize our inventory assortment and upgrade our automated replenishment system to improve inventory turnover. In line with this strategy, we have a service entity in Rotterdam, Netherlands referred to as the European Import Center (“EIC”) in order to improve supply chain management in the European markets in which we operate. The EIC manages a portion of the purchasing of inventory from third party vendors located in Asia on behalf of our wholly-owned subsidiaries within Europe.
Our Vendors
We procure our merchandise from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2016, we had 3,600 active vendor relationships. For fiscal 2016, our top 20 vendors worldwide, based on our purchase volume in U.S. Dollar (“USD”), represented 43% of the total products we purchased.
