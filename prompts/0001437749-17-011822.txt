Item 1 - Business. 
 
Towerstream Corporation (“Towerstream”, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) is primarily a provider of fixed wireless services to businesses in twelve major urban markets across the U.S. During its first decade of operations, the Company's business activities were focused on delivering fixed wireless broadband services to commercial customers over a wireless network transmitting over both regulated and unregulated radio spectrum. The Company's fixed wireless service supports bandwidth on demand, wireless redundancy, virtual private networks, disaster recovery, bundled data and video services. The Company provides services to business customers in New York City, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Miami, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Philadelphia, Las Vegas-Reno and Providence-Newport. The Company's "Fixed Wireless Services Business" ("Fixed Wireless" or "FW") has historically grown both organically and through the acquisition of five other fixed wireless broadband providers in various markets. 
 
The Company's traditional fixed wireless business delivers high volume broadband to clients through a radio receiver/transmitter on each client’s building which is dedicated solely to the Company’s clients in such building. Beginning in the first half of 2014, the Company shifted its sales and marketing strategy to focus on its fixed wireless On-Net platform, which allows one radio receiver/transmitter to service multiple clients per building. Under its On-Net platform, the Company is able to connect, or “light”, the entire building at once and at a cost similar to what was traditionally required for one high bandwidth customer requiring point-to-point equipment. This can be accomplished, in part, because the capabilities of the equipment installed by the Company have improved even as the cost has decreased. As a result, Towerstream is able to leverage the initial installation cost to serve the entire building tenant base. In place of a wireless install for every single customer, Towerstream now only has to install the wireless portion of the install once. Subsequent customers are connected by simply running a wire to the common space in the building where the wireless service terminates. Additionally, instead of having multiple antennas on both the customer building and the Points-of-Presence (“PoP” or “Company Locations”), there generally needs to be only one antenna on each location. 
 
Currently the Company is offering 1.5Mbps (Megabits per second), 5Mbps to 10Mbps, and 100Mbps to 1.5Gbps (Gigabits per second) bandwidth denominations.  This unique portfolio of bandwidth services is able to go up and down existing markets, from small businesses to fortune 500 companies. Such service is as fast as fiber and equally as stable.
 
In January 2013, the Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Hetnets Tower Corporation (“Hetnets”), to operate a new business designed to leverage its fixed wireless network in urban markets to provide other wireless technology solutions and services. Hetnets built a carrier-class network which offered a shared wireless infrastructure platform, primarily for (i) co-location of customer owned antenna and related equipment and (ii) Wi-Fi access and offloading. The Company referred to this as its “Shared Wireless Infrastructure” or “Shared Wireless” business. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company determined to exit this capital-intensive business and curtailed activities in its smaller markets. The remaining network, located in New York City (or “NYC”), was the largest and had a lease access contract with a major cable company. As a result, the Company explored opportunities during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 to sell the NYC network.

As further described in Note 4 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, on March 9, 2016, the Company completed a sale and transfer of certain assets to the major cable company (the “Buyer”). The asset purchase agreement ("Agreement") provided that the Buyer would assume certain rooftop leases in NYC and acquire ownership of the Wi-Fi access points and related equipment associated with operating the network. The Company retained ownership of all backhaul and related equipment and the parties entered into a backhaul services agreement under which the Company will provide bandwidth to the Buyer at the locations governed by the leases. The Agreement is for a three-year period with two, one year renewals and is cancellable by the Buyer on sixty days’ notice. The operating results and cash flows for Hetnets have been presented as discontinued operating results in these consolidated financial statements. Assets associated with the NYC network were presented as Assets Held for Sale as of December 31, 2015.
 
Our Network
 
The foundation of our network consists of PoPs which are generally located on very tall buildings in each urban market. We enter into long-term lease agreements with the owners of these buildings which provide us with the right to install communications equipment on the rooftop. We deploy this equipment in order to connect customers to the Internet. Each PoP is "linked" to one or more other PoPs to enhance redundancy and ensure that there is no single point of failure in the network. One or more of our PoPs are located in buildings where national Internet service providers such as Cogent or Level 3 are located, and we enter into IP transit or peering arrangements with these organizations in order to connect to the Internet. We refer to the core connectivity of all of our PoPs as a “Wireless Ring in the Sky.” Each PoP has a coverage area averaging approximately six miles although the distance can be affected by numerous factors, most significantly, how clear the line of sight is between the PoP and a customer location.
 
Our network does not depend on traditional copper wire or fiber connections which are the backbone of many of our competitors' networks. We believe this provides us with an advantage because we may not be significantly affected by events such as natural disasters and power outages. Conversely, our competitors are at greater risk as copper and fiber connections are typically installed at or below ground level and more susceptible to network service issues during disasters and outages.
 
Markets
 
We launched our fixed wireless business in April 2001 in the Boston and Providence markets. In June 2003, we launched service in New York City and followed that with our entry into the Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Dallas-Fort Worth markets at various times through April 2008. Philadelphia was our last market launch in November 2009. We entered the Seattle, Las Vegas-Reno, and Houston markets through acquisitions of service providers based in those markets. We also expanded our market coverage and presence in Boston, Providence, and Los Angeles through acquisitions.

We determine which geographic markets to enter by assessing criteria in four broad categories. First, we evaluate our ability to deploy our service in a given market after taking into consideration our spectrum position, the availability of towers and other mounting structures. Second, we assess the market by evaluating the number of competitors, existing price points, demographic characteristics and distribution channels. Third, we evaluate the economic potential of the market, focusing on our forecasts of revenue opportunities and capital requirements. Finally, we look at market clustering opportunities and other cost efficiencies that might be realized. Based on this approach, as of December 31, 2016, we offered wireless broadband connectivity in 12 markets, of which 10 are in the top 20 metropolitan areas in the United States based on the number of small to medium businesses in each market. These 10 markets cover approximately 30% of small and medium businesses (5 to 249 employees) in the United States based on information obtained from AtoZDatabases.com .
 
We believe there are market opportunities beyond the 12 markets in which we are currently offering our services. Our long-term plan is to expand nationally into other top metropolitan markets in the United States. We believe that acquisitions represent a more cost effective manner to expand into new markets rather than to build our own infrastructure. Since 2010, we have completed five acquisitions, of which two were in new markets and three expanded our presence in existing markets. We have paid for these acquisitions through a combination of cash and equity, and believe that future acquisitions will be paid in a similar manner. Our decision to expand into new markets will depend upon many factors including the timing and frequency of acquisitions, national and local economic conditions, and the opportunity to leverage existing customer relationships in new markets.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We employ an inside direct sales force model to sell our services to business customers. As of December 31, 2016, we employed nineteen direct sales people. We generally compensate these employees on a salary plus commission basis. 
 
Historically, we relied upon on Internet based marketing initiatives designed to capture customer demand. Most companies secure their bandwidth service under contracts ranging in length from one to three years. As a result, customer buying decisions generally occur when their existing contracts are close to expiring. We believe that many buyers of information technology services search the Internet to learn about industry trends and developments, as well as competitive service offerings. Spending on Internet based marketing initiatives totaled $126,500 and $758,750 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Sales through indirect channels comprised 34% of our total revenues during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Our channel program provides for recurring monthly residual payments ranging from 8% to 20%.

Effective January 24, 2017, we hired a new Chief Executive Officer who is a telecommunications industry veteran and has extensive experience developing markets and increasing revenue. Our sales organization has been recently restructured for 2017 and beyond to create a more disciplined approach to identify and target prospective customers. Included in this strategy is a new methodology, which includes professional sales and development training, which will assist our sales professionals with achieving both volume and velocity. Enterprise demands are routinely moving towards and exceeding 100Mbps speeds. To ensure we are prepared for increasing connection speeds expected to be demanded in the marketplace, our service offerings will be condensed and priced accordingly. We will be offering three speeds with customized quotes for larger bandwidth needs between 100Mbps and 1Gbps.
 
Competition
 
The market for broadband services is highly competitive, and includes companies that offer a variety of services using a number of different technology platforms including cable networks, digital subscriber lines (“DSL”), third, fourth, and fifth-generation cellular, satellite, wireless Internet service and other emerging technologies. We compete with these companies on the basis of the portability, ease of use, speed of installation and price. Competitors to our wireless broadband services include:
Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and Competitive Local Exchange Carriers
 
We face competition from traditional wireline operators in terms of price, performance, discounted rates for bundles of services, breadth of service, reliability, network security, and ease of access and use. In particular, we face competition from Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. which are referred to as “incumbent local exchange carriers,” or (“ILECS”), as well as competitive local exchange carriers (“CLECS”) such as TelePacific Communications, MegaPath Networks, and EarthLink, Inc.
Cable Modem, DSL, and Fiber Services
 
We compete with companies that provide Internet connectivity through cable modems, DSL, and fiber services. Principal competitors include cable companies, such as Comcast Corporation, Time Warner Cable, Spectrum Communications (previously known as Charter Communications), Cox Communications and incumbent telecommunications companies, such as AT&T Inc. or Verizon Communications Inc. Both the cable and telecommunications companies deploy their services over wired networks initially designed for voice and one-way data transmission that have subsequently been upgraded to provide for additional two-way voice, video and broadband services.
 
Cellular and CMRS Services
 
Cellular and other Commercial Mobile Radio Service (“CMRS”) carriers are seeking to expand their capacity to provide data and voice services that are superior to ours. These providers have substantially broader geographic coverage than we have and, for the foreseeable future, than we expect to have. If one or more of these providers can deploy technologies that compete effectively with our services, the mobility and coverage offered by these carriers will provide even greater competition than we currently face. Moreover, more advanced cellular and CMRS technologies, such as fourth generation Long Term Evolution (“LTE”) mobile technologies, and fifth generation millimeter wave technology currently offer broadband service with packet data transfer speeds of up to 2,000,000 bits per second for fixed applications, and slower speeds for mobile applications. We expect that LTE technology will be improved to increase connectivity speeds to make it more suitable for a range of advanced applications.

Wireless Broadband Service Providers
 
We also face competition from other wireless broadband service providers that use licensed and unlicensed spectrum. In connection with our merger and acquisition activities, we have determined that most of our current and planned markets already have one or more locally based companies providing wireless broadband Internet services. In addition, many local governments, universities and other related entities are providing or subsidizing Wi-Fi networks over unlicensed spectrum, in some cases at no cost to the user. There exist numerous small urban and rural wireless operations offering local services that could compete with us in our present or planned geographic markets.
Satellite 

Satellite providers, such as Hughes Network Systems, LLC, offer broadband data services that address a niche market, mainly less densely populated areas that are unserved or underserved by competing service providers. Although satellite offers service to a large geographic area, latency caused by the time it takes for the signal to travel to and from the satellite may challenge a satellite provider’s ability to provide some services, such as Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”), which reduces the size of the addressable market.
Other 

We believe other emerging technologies may also seek to enter the broadband services market. For example, we are aware that several power generation and distribution companies are seeking to develop or have already offered commercial broadband Internet services over existing electric power lines.
Competitive Strengths
 
Even though we face substantial existing and prospective competition, we believe that we have a number of competitive advantages that will allow us to retain existing customers and attract new customers over time.
Reliability

Our network was designed specifically to support wireless broadband services. The networks of cellular, cable and DSL companies rely on infrastructure that was originally designed for non-broadband purposes. We also connect our customers to our Wireless Ring in the Sky which has no single point of failure. This ring is fed by multiple national Internet providers located at opposite ends of our service cities and connected to our national ring which is fed by multiple leading carriers. We believe that we are the only wireless broadband provider that offers true separate egress for true redundancy. With DSL and cable offerings, the wireline connection can be terminated by one backhoe swipe or switch failure. Our Wireless Ring in the Sky is not likely to be affected by backhoe or other below-ground accidents or severe weather. As a result, our network has historically experienced reliability rates of approximately 99%.

Flexibility
 
Our wireless infrastructure and service delivery enables us to respond quickly to changes in a customer’s broadband requirements. We offer bandwidth options ranging from 0.5 megabits per second up to 1.5 gigabit per second. We can usually adjust a customer’s bandwidth remotely and without having to visit the customer location to modify or install new equipment. Changes can often be made on a same day basis.
Timeliness
 
We have demonstrated the capability to install a new customer and begin delivering Internet connectivity within 3 to 5 business days after receiving a customer’s order. Many of the larger telecommunications companies can take 30 to 60 days to complete an installation. The timeliness of service delivery has become more important as businesses conduct more of their business operations through the Internet.
Value

We own our entire network which enables us to price our services lower than most of our competitors. Specifically, we are able to offer competitive prices because we do not have to buy a local loop charge from the telephone company.
Efficient Economic Model
 
We believe our economic model is characterized by low fixed capital and operating expenditures relative to other wireless and wireline broadband service providers. We own our entire network which eliminates costs involved with using leased lines owned by telephone or cable companies. Our network is modular. Coverage is directly related to various factors including the height of the facility we are on and the frequencies we utilize. The average area covered by a PoP is a six-mile radius.
Prime Real Estate Locations
 
We have secured long term lease agreements for prime real estate locations in the twelve markets in which we have built our fixed wireless network. These locations are some of the tallest buildings in each city which facilitates our ability to deliver Internet connectivity to customer locations where line of sight is not available to our competitors.

Corporate History
 
We were organized in the State of Nevada in June 2005. In January 2007, we merged with and into a wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary for the sole purpose of changing our state of incorporation to Delaware. In January 2007, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours merged with and into a private company formed in 1999, Towerstream Corporation, with Towerstream Corporation being the surviving company. Upon closing of the merger, we discontinued our former business and succeeded to the business of Towerstream Corporation as our sole line of business. At the same time, we also changed our name to Towerstream Corporation and our subsidiary, Towerstream Corporation, changed its name to Towerstream I, Inc.
Regulatory Matters 
 
The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”), and the regulations and policies of the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) impact significant aspects of our wireless Internet service business which is also subject to other regulation by federal, state and local authorities under applicable laws and regulations.
Spectrum Regulation
 
We provide wireless broadband Internet access services using both licensed and unlicensed fixed point-to-point systems. The FCC has jurisdiction over the management and licensing of the electromagnetic spectrum for all commercial users. The FCC routinely reviews its spectrum policies and may change its position on spectrum use and allocations from time to time. We believe that the FCC is committed to allocating spectrum to support wireless broadband deployment throughout the United States and will continue to modify its regulations to foster such deployment, which will help us implement our existing and future business plans.
Broadband Internet Service Regulation
 
Our wireless broadband network can be used to provide Internet access service and Virtual Private Networks (“VPNs”). On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted an Open Internet order in which fixed and mobile broadband services is reclassified as a telecommunications services governed by Title II of the Communications Act. This reclassification includes forbearance from applying many sections of the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules to broadband service providers. The Open Internet order also adopted rules prohibiting broadband service providers from: (1) blocking access to legal content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; (2) impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on its basis, content, applications or services; or (3) favoring certain Internet traffic over other traffic in exchange for consideration. Our wireless broadband Internet services are also subject to a number of federal regulatory requirements, including but not limited to, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (“CALEA”) requirement that high-speed Internet service providers implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity.
 
In addition, Internet service providers are subject to a wide range of other federal regulations and statutes including, for example, regulations and policies relating to low-income subsidies, consumer protection, consumer privacy, and copyright protections. State and local government authorities may also regulate limited aspects of our business by, for example, imposing consumer protection and consumer privacy regulations, zoning requirements, and requiring installation permits.

Regulatory Issues
 
Our antennas and equipment used to provide wireless broadband service are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"). As such, any changes in FCC regulations involving the use or deployment of wireless broadband service could have a positive or negative impact on our business. 
Other - FAA Interference Issue
 
In August 2013, the FCC released a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture ("NAL") alleging that Towerstream caused harmful interference to doppler weather radar systems in New York and Florida, and proposing a fine for the alleged rule violations. In November 2013, after consultation with regulatory counsel, Towerstream filed a response denying the FCC's allegations. In July 2016, Towerstream settled the matter with the FCC under a consent decree that required Towerstream to admit that it violated the laws and regulations that prohibit Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure transmission systems operators from causing interference to doppler weather radar systems, to comply with such rules in the future, and to pay a civil penalty. The Company paid such penalty during the year ended December 31, 2016 and that amount was not material to the operating results for that period.
Rights Plan
 
In November 2010, we adopted a rights plan (the “Rights Plan”) and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock as of the record date on November 14, 2010. Each right, when exercisable, entitles the registered holder to purchase one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per shares of the Company at a purchase price of $18.00 per one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share of the Series A Preferred Stock, subject to certain adjustments. The rights will generally separate from the common stock and become exercisable if any person or group acquires or announces a tender offer to acquire 15% or more of our outstanding common stock without the consent of our Board of Directors. Because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our Board of Directors, our Rights Plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us (or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock) without first negotiating with our Board of Directors. In addition, we are governed by provisions of Delaware law that may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us.
 
The provisions in our charter, bylaws, Rights Plan and under Delaware law, related to the foregoing, could discourage takeover attempts that our stockholders would otherwise favor, or otherwise reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock in the future.
