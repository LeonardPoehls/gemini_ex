ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Broadcom Limited, or Broadcom, is the successor to Avago Technologies Limited, or Avago, as a result of the business combination between Avago and Broadcom Corporation, or BRCM, completed on February 1, 2016, or the Broadcom Transaction. We are a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, based devices and analog III-V based products. We have a history of innovation and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, mobile handsets and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. We differentiate ourselves through our high performance design and integration capabilities and focus on developing products for target markets where we believe we can earn attractive margins. We have four reportable segments: wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage, and industrial & other, which align with our principal target markets. 
The Partnership is an exempted limited partnership formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Broadcom is the sole General Partner and owns a majority interest (by vote and value) in the Partnership. As General Partner, Broadcom has the exclusive right, power and authority to manage, control, administer and operate the business and affairs and to make decisions regarding the undertaking and business of the Partnership in accordance with the Partnership’s amended and restated exempted partnership agreement, or the Partnership Agreement, and applicable laws. There is no board of directors of the Partnership.
Semiconductors are made by imprinting a network of electronic components onto a semiconductor wafer. These devices are designed to perform various functions such as processing, amplifying and selectively filtering electronic signals, controlling electronic system functions and processing, and transmitting and storing data. Our digital and mixed signal products are based on silicon wafers with CMOS transistors offering fast switching speeds and low power consumption, which are both critical design factors for the markets we serve. We also offer analog products, which are based on III-V semiconductor materials that have higher electrical conductivity than silicon, and thus tend to have better performance characteristics in radio frequency, or RF, and optoelectronic applications. III-V refers to elements from the 3rd and 5th groups in the periodic table of chemical elements. Examples of these materials used in our products are gallium arsenide, or GaAs, gallium nitride, and indium phosphide, or InP. Following the acquisition of Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., or Brocade, we also offer mission critical fibre channel storage area networking, or FC SAN, products in the form of modules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products.
Our over 50-year history of innovation dates back to our diverse origins from Hewlett-Packard Company, AT&T, LSI Corporation, or LSI, and BRCM. Over the years, we have assembled a large team of digital, mixed signal and analog design engineers around the world. We maintain design and product development engineering resources at locations in the United States, Asia, Europe and Israel, providing us with engineering expertise worldwide. We strategically focus our research and development resources to address niche opportunities in our target markets and leverage our extensive portfolio of U.S. and other patents and other intellectual property, or IP, to integrate multiple technologies and create system-on-chip, or SoC, and component solutions that target growth opportunities. We design products that deliver high-performance and provide mission-critical functionality.
Original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or their contract manufacturers, and distributors typically account for the substantial majority of our sales. We have established strong relationships with leading OEM customers across multiple target markets. Many of our major customer relationships have been in place for many years and have often been built as a result of years of collaborative product development. This has enabled us to build our IP portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customers’ requirements, including substantial system level knowledge. This collaboration has provided us with key insights into our customers' businesses and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers. We have a direct sales force focused on supporting large OEMs. We also distribute a substantial portion of our products through our broad distribution network, and a significant amount of these sales are to large global electronic components distributors, including Avnet, Inc.
We focus on maintaining an efficient global supply chain and a variable, low-cost operating model. Accordingly, we outsource a majority of our manufacturing operations, utilizing third-party foundry and assembly and test capabilities, as well as some of our corporate infrastructure functions. We focus our internal fabrication capacity and capital expenditures on products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes, to protect our IP and to accelerate time to market of our products, while outsourcing commodity processes such as standard CMOS. We also have a long history of operating in Asia, where approximately 38% of our employees are located and where we manufacture and source the majority of our products and materials. Our presence in Asia places us in close proximity to many of our customers’ manufacturing facilities and at the center of worldwide electronics manufacturing.

Recent Developments
U.S. 2017 Tax Reform Act
On December 20, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the 2017 Tax Reform Act, was approved by Congress and is pending presidential approval. In general, the 2017 Tax Reform Act reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective in 2018. The 2017 Tax Reform Act moves from worldwide business taxation to a participation exemption regime. The 2017 Tax Reform Act also imposes base-erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings of U.S. entities, as well as a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated non-U.S. earnings of U.S. entities. The base-erosion prevention measures will have the effect of subjecting non-U.S. earnings of U.S. entities to taxation in the United States at an effective rate that is expected to be substantially lower than 21%. The 2017 Tax Reform Act will affect the tax position and cash taxes of our U.S. entities and will have a corresponding impact on our consolidated financial results starting in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018.
Acquisition of Brocade
On November 17, 2017, we acquired Brocade for approximately $6.1 billion. Brocade’s networking solutions help the world’s leading organizations turn their networks into platforms for business innovation. With solutions spanning public and private data centers to the network edge, Brocade is a leader in FC SAN switching. We are in the process of integrating Brocade into our enterprise storage segment. In connection with the acquisition of Brocade, or the Brocade Merger, we incurred $4.0 billion of indebtedness.
Proposed Acquisition of Qualcomm
On November 6, 2017, we announced a proposal to acquire Qualcomm Incorporated, or Qualcomm, for $70 per share, consisting of $60 in cash and $10 in Broadcom ordinary shares. We stated that the proposal stands whether Qualcomm’s pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors N.V., or NXP, is consummated on the then-disclosed terms of $110 per NXP share or is terminated. Including the assumption of net debt and giving effect to the pending NXP acquisition, the enterprise value of the proposed transaction is approximately $130 billion.
On November 13, 2017, Qualcomm’s board of directors rejected our proposal. In response, we announced that we remained fully committed to pursuing the acquisition of Qualcomm and reiterated our proposal.
On December 4, 2017, we announced that we had provided notice to Qualcomm of our intent to nominate 11 candidates for election to the Qualcomm board of directors at Qualcomm’s 2018 annual meeting of stockholders.
On December 11, 2017, we filed preliminary proxy materials with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, in connection with our planned solicitation of proxies to elect 11 independent, highly qualified nominees to the Qualcomm board of directors at Qualcomm’s 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, which Qualcomm has announced will be held on March 6, 2018.
We also filed a premerger notification under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission regarding our proposed acquisition of Qualcomm.
No agreement has been reached with Qualcomm and there can be no assurance that any transaction will result from our proposal.
Redomiciliation to the United States from Singapore
On November 2, 2017, we announced our intention to initiate a process to change the ultimate parent company of the Broadcom group from a Singapore company to a U.S. corporation. The final form and timing of the redomiciliation has not yet been finalized and may be affected by the implementation of the 2017 Tax Reform Act. In addition, the redomiciliation is subject to the approval of our shareholders. We presently expect that our overall cash tax costs will approximately double, as compared to our fiscal year 2017 results, due to the redomiciliation and taking in account our initial estimates of the expected effects of the 2017 Tax Reform Act.

Research and Development
We are committed to continuous investment in product development, with a focus on rapidly introducing new, proprietary products. Many of our products have grown out of our own research and development efforts, and have given us competitive advantages in certain target markets due to performance differentiation. However, from time to time we also seek to enhance our capabilities through the acquisition of engineers with complementary research and development skills and complementary technologies and businesses. We focus our research and development efforts on the development of innovative, sustainable and higher value product platforms. We leverage our design capabilities in markets where we believe our innovation and reputation will allow us to earn attractive margins by developing high value-add products.
We plan to continue investing in product development, both organically and through acquisition, to drive growth in our business. We also invest in process development and fabrication capabilities to optimize processes for devices that are manufactured internally. Our field application engineers and design engineers are located in many places around the world, and in many cases near our top customers. This enhances our customer reach and our visibility into new product opportunities and enables us to support our customers in each stage of their product development cycle, from early stages of production design through to volume manufacturing and future growth. By collaborating with our customers, we have opportunities to develop high value-added, customized products for them that leverage our existing technologies. Research and development expense was $3.3 billion, $2.7 billion and $1.0 billion for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts included share-based compensation expense of $636 million, $430 million and $107 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position, and with a continuous flow of innovative and sustainable product platforms. 
Customers, Sales and Distribution
We sell our products to a wide variety of OEMs or their contract manufacturers, distributors and end customers. Certain customers require us to contract with them directly and with specified intermediaries, such as contract manufacturers, and both they and their contract manufacturers often require time-critical delivery of our products to multiple locations around the world. Historically, a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. Sales to distributors accounted for 28% and 30% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. Direct sales to Foxconn Technology Group companies (including Hon Hai Precision Industries), together referred to as Foxconn, accounted for 14% of our net revenue for both fiscal years 2017 and 2016. We believe our aggregate sales to our top five end customers, through all channels, accounted for more than 40% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2017 and more than 30% for fiscal year 2016. We believe aggregate sales to Apple, Inc., through all channels, accounted for more than 20% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2017 and approximately 15% for fiscal year 2016. We expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top five end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We sell our products through our direct sales force and a select network of distributors globally. Our direct sales force is focused on supporting our large OEM customers. Our sales force has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer’s organization.
We have sales offices located in various countries, with a significant presence in Asia, which is a key center of the worldwide electronics supply chain. Many of our customers design products in North America or Europe that are then manufactured in Asia. We also maintain dedicated regional customer support call centers, where we address customer issues and handle logistics and other order fulfillment requirements. 
We have strategically developed distributor relationships to serve thousands of customers around the world. A significant amount of our sales are to large global electronic components distributors, including Avnet, Inc., complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges.
We believe we are well-positioned to support our customers throughout the design, technology transfer and manufacturing stages across all geographies.

Examples of internally fabricated 
8

semiconductors include our FBAR filters for wireless communications and our vertical-cavity surface emitting laser-based and InP-based lasers for fiber optic communications. The majority of our internal III-V semiconductor wafer fabrication is done in the United States and Singapore. Many of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process, typically at one particular foundry, either our own or with a particular contract manufacturer, and in some instances, we may only qualify one contract manufacturer to manufacture certain of our products. 
We store the majority of our product inventory in our warehouse in Malaysia. However, for selected customers, we maintain finished goods inventory near or at customer manufacturing sites to support their just-in-time production. 
Materials and Suppliers
Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials. We purchase materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis. These supply relationships are generally conducted on a purchase order basis. While we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining the materials used in the conduct of our business and we believe that no single supplier is material, some of the parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for re-design or qualification. Our long-term relationships with our suppliers allow us to proactively manage our technology development and product discontinuance plans, and to monitor our suppliers' financial health. Some suppliers may, nonetheless, extend their lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique or highly specialized components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly, or at all. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we may use a number of techniques, including, in some cases, qualifying more than one source of supply, redesigning products for alternative components and incremental, or in some cases "lifetime," purchases of affected parts for supply buffer.
Competition
The global semiconductor market is highly competitive. Our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. We compete with integrated device manufacturers, or IDMs, and fabless semiconductor companies, as well as the internal resources of large, integrated OEMs. The competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within the industry, as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors while others have begun collaborating with each other. We expect this consolidation trend to continue. We expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market. Additionally, our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors, including: quality, technical performance, price, product features, product system compatibility, system-level design capability, engineering expertise, responsiveness to customers, new product innovation, product availability, delivery timing and reliability, and customer sales and technical support.
Our primary competitors in the wired infrastructure segment are Cavium Inc., Intel Corp., Finisar Corp., GlobalFoundries, HiSilicon Technologies Co. Ltd., Lumentum Operations LLC, MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., Marvell Corp., Mediatek Inc., Mellanox Technologies, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V., Quantenna Inc., ST Microelectronics N.V., and Sumitomo Corporation. We compete based on the strength of our high speed proprietary design expertise, our customer relationships, and broad product portfolio.
Our primary competitors in the wireless communications segment are Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Qorvo, Inc., Qualcomm, Skyworks Solutions, Inc., and TDK-EPC Corporation. We compete based on our expertise in FBAR technology, amplifier design, module integration and proprietary material processes.
Our primary competitors in the enterprise storage segment include Cavium Inc., Marvell Technology Group, Ltd., Microsemi Corp., and Texas Instruments, Inc. We compete based on our expertise in multiple storage protocols and mixed-signal design.

We compete based on our design expertise, broad product portfolio, reputation for quality products and large customer base.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and similar IP, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through security measures to protect our trade secrets. We believe our current product expertise, key engineering talent and IP portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets.
9

As of October 29, 2017, we had 24,250 U.S. and other patents and 2,061 U.S. and other pending patent applications. Our research and development efforts are presently resulting in approximately 150 new patent applications per year, relating to a wide range of ASIC, isolation, encoder, LED, RF and optoelectronic components, enterprise storage products, HDD silicon, PCIe, USB and other standard I/O devices, Ethernet and Fibre-Channel connectivity and controllers, set-top box SoCs, cable modem SoCs, broadband access SoCs, wireless connectivity SoCs, switching/routing SoCs, high performance processor SoCs and associated applications. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2018 to 2036, with a small number of patents expiring in the near future, none of which are expected to be material to our IP portfolio. We are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents.
We focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products, as contrasted with more basic research. However, we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims. 
We and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of IP licensing and cross-licensing arrangements that have both benefited our business and enabled some of our competitors. A portion of our revenue comes from IP licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to such IP. We also license in third-party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities, products and manufacturing processes. Historically, licenses of the third-party technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms. 
The semiconductor industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products. Many of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party IP infringement claims. Claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any IP rights claims against us or our customers or distributors, we may be required to cease manufacture of the infringing product, pay damages, expend resources to develop non-infringing technology, seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or relinquish patents or other IP rights.
Employees
As of October 29, 2017, we had approximately 14,000 employees worldwide. By geography, approximately 55% of our employees are located in North America, 38% in Asia, and 7% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In the United States, none of our employees are represented by a labor union. In Singapore, approximately 270 of our 829 employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. A small number of our employees in other countries is represented by workers' councils or labor unions. 
Environmental and Other Regulation
Our research and development and manufacturing operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health, safety and the environment. These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air, water, and soil; remediation requirements; product chemical content limitations; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; pollution control requirements; waste minimization considerations; and treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We are also subject to regulation by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions.
We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental, health and safety laws to our business will not require us to incur significant expenditures.
We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements, including legislation enacted in the United States, European Union and China, among a growing number of jurisdictions, which have placed greater restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products, which affects materials composition and semiconductor packaging. These laws are becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenditures. 
Backlog
Our sales are generally made pursuant to short-term purchase orders. These purchase orders are made without deposits and may be, and often are, rescheduled, canceled or modified on relatively short notice, without substantial penalty. Therefore, we believe that purchase orders or backlog are not necessarily a reliable indicator of future sales.

Seasonality
Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half, primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communications segment. This segment has historically experienced seasonality due to launches of new mobile handsets manufactured by our OEM customers. However, from time to time, typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects, the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large OEMs, particularly in the wireless communications segment. We have a diversified business portfolio and our wired infrastructure segment represents the largest portion of our net revenue. We believe that our overall revenue is less susceptible to seasonal variations as a result of the diversification of our business portfolio.
