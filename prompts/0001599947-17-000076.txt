The diagram below is a summary depiction of our organizational structure as of June 30, 2017:
 
 —————

(1) | Both SunEdison, Inc. and SunEdison Holdings Corporation are debtors in the SunEdison Bankruptcy (as defined below). SunEdison’s economic interest is subject to certain limitations on distributions to holders of Class B units during the Subordination Period.


(2) | The economic interest of holders of Class A units, Class B units, and, in turn, holders of shares of Class A common stock, is subject to the right of holders of the incentive distribution rights, or "IDRs," to receive a portion of distributions after certain distribution thresholds are met. On January 22, 2016, 12,161,844 Class B shares held by SunEdison were converted to 12,161,844 Class A shares and were sold to unaffiliated third parties by SunEdison. After giving effect to the conversion, SunEdison, Inc. indirectly owns 48,202,310 Class B shares of the Company, holds 83.9% of the voting interest in the Company and owns 34.2% of the economic interests of Terra LLC. SunEdison Holdings Corporation ("Holdings"), which is a wholly owned and controlled subsidiary of SunEdison, Inc. owns its Class B common stock, Class B units and IDRs directly and indirectly through a wholly owned and controlled subsidiary, SunE ML 1, LLC, which is also a debtor in the SunEdison Bankruptcy.


(3) | IDRs represent a variable interest in distributions by Terra LLC and therefore cannot be expressed as a fixed percentage ownership interest in Terra LLC. All of our IDRs are currently issued to Holdings or its direct or indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, SunE ML 1, LLC.

(4) | Represents total borrowing capacity as of June 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2017, there were $497.0 million of revolving loans and $60.9 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Revolver, with availability of $12.1 million as of such date.

Our Business Strategy
Our primary business strategy is to own and operate a portfolio of renewable energy assets and to pay cash dividends to our stockholders. We intend to grow our portfolio over time through acquisitions in order to increase the cash dividends we pay to our stockholders. 
We have acquired a portfolio of long-term contracted clean power generation assets from SunEdison and unaffiliated third parties that have proven technologies, creditworthy counterparties, low operating risks and stable cash flows. We have focused on the solar and wind energy segments because we believe they are currently the fastest growing segments of the clean energy industry. Solar and wind assets are also attractive because there is no associated fuel cost risk, the technologies have become highly reliable and assets generally have an estimated expected life of 20 to 30 years.

On April 21, 2016, SunEdison Inc. and certain of its domestic and international subsidiaries (the "SunEdison Debtors") voluntarily filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the "SunEdison Bankruptcy"). In anticipation of and in response to SunEdison’s financial and operating difficulties, which culminated in the SunEdison Bankruptcy, at the direction of our Board of Directors (the "Board"), we have undertaken, and continue to undertake, a number of strategic initiatives to mitigate the adverse impacts of the SunEdison Bankruptcy on the Company. These initiatives focused on governance, operations and business performance initiatives deemed especially critical because SunEdison provided all personnel and services to the Company (other than those operational services provided by third parties). These initiatives include, among other things, developing continuity plans, establishing stand-alone information technology, accounting and other systems and infrastructure, directly hiring employees and self-performing or retaining backup or replacement service providers for the operation and maintenance ("O&M") and asset management of our wind and solar facilities.
As part of this overall strategic review process, we also initiated a process for the exploration and evaluation of potential strategic alternatives for the Company, including potential transactions to secure a new sponsor or sell the Company. As more fully described below, on March 6, 2017, this process resulted in our entry into a definitive merger and sponsorship transaction agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) and agreements to enter into a suite of support and sponsorship arrangements (the "Sponsorship Transaction") with Brookfield Asset Management Inc. ("Brookfield") and certain of its affiliates and our entry into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) and a voting and support agreement (the “Voting and Support Agreement”) with SunEdison and the SunEdison Debtors. 
We continue to focus on these strategic initiatives and other near-term plans and priorities in order to better position the Company to return to its focus on growing its solar and wind portfolio and to pay and increase the cash dividends it pays to its shareholders. These initiatives, plans and priorities include:

• | focusing on the performance and efficiency of our existing portfolio of renewable energy facilities;


• | focusing on satisfying conditions to the effectiveness of the Merger Agreement and the Settlement Agreement to effectuate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Sponsorship Transaction;


• | mitigating, to the extent possible, the adverse impacts resulting from the SunEdison Bankruptcy, including ensuring the continuity of operation, maintenance and asset management of our renewable energy facilities by self-performing those activities or engaging third party providers;


• | creating a separate stand-alone corporate organization, including, among other things, directly hiring employees and establishing our own accounting, information technology, human resources and other systems and infrastructure;


• | working with project-level lenders and financing parties to cure, or obtain waivers or forbearance of, defaults that have arisen under most of our project-level debt financings as a result of the SunEdison Bankruptcy and delays in delivering corporate and project-level audited financial statements, among other things; and


• | seeking to optimize our portfolio and capital structure by reducing corporate-level indebtedness, financing or refinancing certain renewable energy facilities at the project level, exiting certain markets or selling certain assets if we believe the opportunity would improve stockholder value.

While we remain focused on executing our near-term objectives, we also continue to pursue our long-term business strategy, which is to own, operate and grow our portfolio with assets that have proven technologies, creditworthy counterparties, lower operating risks and stable cash flows in markets with attractive long-term power pricing dynamics and predictable regulatory environments.

Recent Developments
Business Update 
As of June 30, 2017, our renewable energy generation fleet stands at 2,606.7 MW, over three times the size of our initial portfolio in July 2014. Our fleet is contracted for a weighted average (based on MW) remaining period of 14 years as of June 30, 2017 with creditworthy counterparties and provides significant ongoing cash flow. 
Transition to Standalone Operations
We have been transitioning away from our historical reliance on SunEdison for management, corporate and accounting services, employees, systems and information technology infrastructure, and the operation, maintenance and asset management of our power plants. As part of this transition, as of January 1, 2017, certain employees of SunEdison who provided dedicated corporate-level services to the Company were hired directly by the Company. During the first half of 2017, we hired additional employees of SunEdison who are primarily dedicated to performing O&M, asset management and project-level accounting activities and entered into transition services agreements with SunEdison with respect to the transition of O&M and asset management services. However, we continue to depend on a substantial number of outside contractors and SunEdison employees, as well as accounting and other systems provided by SunEdison, for certain of our continuing operations. We continue to execute on the other aspects of our plan to implement a stand-alone organization and continue to evaluate our employee retention and incentive plans, as well.
Merger and Sponsorship Transaction    
On March 6, 2017, TerraForm Power entered into the Merger Agreement with Orion US Holdings 1 L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“Orion Holdings”), and BRE TERP Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orion Holdings (“Merger Sub”), which are affiliates of Brookfield. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into TerraForm Power (the “Merger”), with TerraForm Power as the surviving corporation in the Merger. Orion Holdings will hold approximately 51% of the Class A shares of TerraForm Power following consummation of the Merger. The Merger Agreement provides that, at or prior to the effective time of the Merger, TerraForm Power and Orion Holdings, Brookfield and certain of their affiliates will enter into the Sponsorship Transaction, a suite of agreements providing for the sponsorship arrangements of Brookfield and certain of its affiliates of the Company as described in greater detail below. 
The Merger Agreement was approved unanimously by the members of our Board voting on the matter, following the unanimous recommendation of our Corporate Governance and Conflicts Committee (“Conflicts Committee”). Completion of the Sponsorship Transaction is expected to occur, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, in the second half of 2017. 
Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, TerraForm Power will declare the payment of a special cash dividend (the “Special Dividend”) in the amount of $1.94 per fully diluted share, which includes the Company’s issued and outstanding Class A shares, Class A shares issued to SunEdison pursuant to the Settlement Agreement (more fully described below) and Class A shares underlying outstanding restricted stock units of the Company under the Company’s long-term incentive plan.
At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Class A common stock of TerraForm Power, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than certain excluded shares) will be converted into the right to, at the holder’s election and subject to proration as described below, either (i) receive $9.52 per Class A share, in cash, without interest (the “Per Share Cash Consideration”) or (ii) retain one share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of TerraForm Power (the “Per Share Stock Consideration,” and, together with the Per Share Cash Consideration, without duplication, the “Per Share Merger Consideration”). Issued and outstanding shares include shares issued in connection with the SunEdison Settlement Agreement as described more fully below and shares underlying outstanding restricted stock units of the Company under the Company's long-term incentive plan. The Per Share Stock Consideration will be subject to proration in the event that the aggregate number of Class A shares for which an election to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration has been made exceeds 49% of the TerraForm Power fully diluted share count (the “Maximum Stock Consideration Shares”). Additionally, the Per Share Cash Consideration will be subject to proration in the event that the aggregate number of Class A shares for which an election to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration has been made exceeds the TerraForm Power fully diluted share count minus (i) the Maximum Stock Consideration Shares, (ii) any Class A shares currently held by affiliates of Brookfield, and (iii) any shares for which the holders seek appraisal under Delaware law.
11

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, SunEdison executed and delivered the Voting and Support Agreement. Under that agreement, SunEdison agreed to vote or cause to be voted any shares of common stock of TerraForm Power held by it or any of its controlled affiliates in favor of the Merger and to take certain other actions to support the consummation of the Merger and the Sponsorship Transaction. 
The Merger Agreement includes a non-waivable condition to closing that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby be approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding Class A shares, excluding SunEdison, Orion Holdings, any of their respective affiliates or any person with whom any of them has formed (and not terminated) a “group” (as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). The closing of the Merger is also subject to certain additional conditions, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding common shares entitled to vote on the Merger and other customary closing conditions. Certain conditions to the closing of the Merger have been satisfied, including (1) the entry of an order by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”) authorizing and approving the entry by SunEdison (and, if applicable, SunEdison’s debtor affiliates) into the Settlement Agreement and the Voting and Support Agreement (each as described more fully below) and any other agreement entered into in connection with the Merger or the Sponsorship Transaction to which SunEdison or any other debtor will be a party, (2) the expiration or early termination of the waiting period applicable to consummation of the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and (3) the closing of the sale of substantially all of our U.K. solar facilities as described below.
There is no financing condition to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we have agreed to provide cooperation as reasonably requested by Orion Holdings in its efforts to obtain debt financing that is to be made available to us from and after the closing of the Merger. Certain lenders have committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in debt commitment letters provided to Orion Holdings, to provide certain financing to repay, refinance, redeem, defease or otherwise repurchase certain Company indebtedness. Orion Holdings has also provided a guaranty, dated as of March 6, 2017, pursuant to which Brookfield Infrastructure Fund III-A (CR), L.P., a limited partnership organized under the laws of Delaware, Brookfield Infrastructure Fund III-A, L.P., a limited partnership organized under the laws of Delaware, Brookfield Infrastructure Fund III-B, L.P., a limited partnership organized under the laws of Delaware, Brookfield Infrastructure Fund III-D, L.P., a limited partnership organized under the laws of Delaware, and Brookfield Infrastructure Fund III-D (CR), L.P., a limited partnership organized under the laws of Delaware (collectively, the “Guarantors”) have guaranteed certain obligations of Orion Holdings under the Merger Agreement. 
Orion Holdings and TerraForm Power have made customary representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement. We have also agreed to various agreements and covenants, including, subject to certain exceptions, to conduct our business in the ordinary course of business between execution of the Merger Agreement and closing of the Merger and not to engage in certain specified types of transactions during that period. In addition, we are subject to a “no change of recommendation” restriction and “no shop” restriction on our ability to solicit alternative business combination proposals from third parties and to provide information to, and engage in discussions with, third parties regarding alternative business combination transactions, except as permitted under the terms of the Merger Agreement. We may not terminate the Merger Agreement to accept an alternative business combination and are required to hold a shareholder vote on the Merger Agreement even if the Board withdraws its recommendation to vote in favor of the Merger. Orion Holdings has also made certain covenants in respect of the operation of the business of Brookfield and its affiliates in a manner that would not impair the ability of Brookfield and its affiliates to perform their sponsorship obligations under the Sponsorship Transaction from and after the effective time of the Merger.
The Merger Agreement contains specified termination rights, including the right for each of us or Orion Holdings to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger is not consummated by December 6, 2017, subject to extension until March 6, 2018 to obtain required regulatory approvals. The Merger Agreement also provides for other customary termination rights for both us and Orion Holdings, as well as a mutual termination right in the event that the Settlement Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated by either us or Orion Holdings due to the failure to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals or the termination of the Settlement Agreement, and the Board did not change its recommendation to our stockholders to approve the Merger, we will pay to Orion Holdings all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the Sponsorship Transaction, in an amount not to exceed $17.0 million. The Merger Agreement further provides that upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain other specified circumstances, we will be required to pay Orion Holdings a termination fee of $50.0 million. Our obligation to pay any combination of out-of-pocket expenses or termination fees shall not in any event exceed $50.0 million. 
In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that, at or prior to the effective time of the Merger, we will enter into the following suite of documents that comprise the Sponsorship Transaction and that provides the basis of the arrangements under which Brookfield and certain of its affiliates will act as the new sponsor of the Company. These agreements include: (a) a 
12

master services agreement (the “Merger MSA”) by and among TerraForm Power, Terra LLC, Terra Operating LLC, Brookfield and certain affiliates of Brookfield (collectively, the “MSA Providers”) pursuant to which the MSA Providers will provide certain management services to TerraForm Power and its subsidiaries commencing at the effective time of the Merger, (b) a revolving credit line agreement, substantially consistent with the term sheet as agreed between Orion Holdings and TerraForm Power as of the date of the Merger Agreement, (the “Sponsor Line Agreement”) by and among TerraForm Power and Brookfield or its affiliates pursuant to which Brookfield or its affiliates will commit up to a $500 million secured revolving credit line to TerraForm Power for use to acquire renewable energy assets or for profit improving capital expenditures, (c) a relationship agreement (the “Relationship Agreement”) by and among TerraForm Power, Terra LLC, Terra Operating LLC and Brookfield, pursuant to which, among other things, Brookfield agrees that the Company will serve as the primary vehicle through which Brookfield and certain of its affiliates will own operating wind and solar assets in North America and certain other Western European nations and that Brookfield will provide, subject to certain terms and conditions, TerraForm Power and its subsidiaries with a right of first offer on certain operating wind and solar assets that are owned by Brookfield and certain of its affiliates and are located in those countries (the “ROFO Pipeline”) and (d) a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) by and among TerraForm Power and Orion Holdings providing Orion Holdings with registration rights with respect to its shares in TerraForm Power after the Merger (together with the IDR Transfer Agreement (as defined below), Merger MSA, Sponsor Line Agreement, Relationship Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement, collectively, the “New Sponsorship Agreements” and individually, each a “New Sponsorship Agreement”). 
As consideration for the services provided or arranged for by Brookfield and its affiliates pursuant to the master services agreement, the Company will pay a base management fee on a quarterly basis that will be paid in arrears and calculated as follows: 

• | for each of the first four quarters following the closing date of the Merger, a fixed component of $2.5 million per quarter (subject to proration for the quarter including the closing date of the Merger) plus 0.3125% of the market capitalization value increase for such quarter;


• | for each of the next four quarters, a fixed component of $3.0 million per quarter plus 0.3125% of the market capitalization value increase for such quarter; and


• | thereafter, a fixed component of $3.75 million per quarter plus 0.3125% of the market capitalization value increase for such quarter.

For purposes of calculating the quarterly payment of the base management fee, the term market capitalization value increase means, for any quarter, the increase in value of the Company’s market capitalization for such quarter, calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock as of the last trading day of such quarter by the difference between (x) the volume-weighted average trading price of a share of Class A common stock for the trading days in such quarter and (y) $9.52. If the difference between (x) and (y) in the market capitalization value increase calculation for a quarter is a negative number, then the market capitalization value increase is deemed to be zero.
Affiliates of Brookfield will hold the IDRs of Terra LLC. At the closing of the Merger, the limited liability company agreement of Terra LLC will be amended and restated to, among other things, reset the IDR thresholds of Terra LLC to establish a first distribution threshold of $0.93 per share of Class A common stock and a second distribution threshold of $1.05 per share of Class A common stock. As a result of this amendment and restatement, amounts distributed from Terra LLC would be distributed on a quarterly basis as follows: 

• | first, to the Company in an amount equal to the Company’s outlays and expenses for such quarter;


• | second, to holders of Class A units, until an amount has been distributed to such holders of Class A units that would result, after taking account of all taxes payable by the Company in respect of the taxable income attributable to such distribution, in a distribution to holders of shares of Class A common stock of $0.93 per share (subject to adjustment for distributions, combinations or subdivisions of shares of Class A common stock) if such amount were distributed to all holders of shares of Class A common stock;


• | third, 15% to the holders of the IDRs and 85% to the holders of Class A units until a further amount has been distributed to holders of Class A units in such quarter that would result, after taking account of all taxes payable by the Company in respect of the taxable income attributable to such distribution, in a distribution to holders of shares of Class A common stock of an additional $0.12 per share (subject to adjustment for distributions, combinations or subdivisions of shares of Class A common stock) if such amount were distributed to all holders of shares of Class A common stock; and


• | thereafter, 75% to holders of Class A units and 25% to holders of the IDRs.

The Merger Agreement also requires TerraForm Power to issue to Orion Holdings additional Class A shares in respect of any losses to TerraForm Power arising out of certain specified litigation matters upon the final resolution of such matters. 
13

Further, at the effective time of the Merger, the governing documents of TerraForm Power, including its by-laws and certificate of incorporation, will be amended and restated to be substantially consistent with the governance terms agreed to between Orion Holdings and TerraForm Power as of the date of the Merger Agreement.
Settlement Agreement and Voting and Support Agreement with SunEdison 
As part of our strategic alternatives process, we entered into the Settlement Agreement and the Voting and Support Agreement with SunEdison on March 6, 2017 to resolve intercompany claims in connection with the SunEdison Bankruptcy, to obtain SunEdison's support of, and to facilitate the closing of, the Merger and the Sponsorship Transaction in light of SunEdison's controlling stake in the Company and to facilitate a complete transition away from SunEdison as our sponsor and as a provider of services to us. The Bankruptcy Court authorized and approved the entry by SunEdison (and its applicable debtor affiliates) into the Settlement Agreement and the Voting and Support Agreement on June 6, 2017. The mutual releases and certain other terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement will become effective upon the consummation of the Merger or other transaction jointly supported by the Company and SunEdison and certain other conditions. Those provisions of the Settlement Agreement would also become effective upon a "Stand-Alone Conversion" as defined in the last paragraph of this section below.
Upon its effectiveness, the Settlement Agreement will resolve claims between TerraForm Power and SunEdison, including among other things, alleged claims of SunEdison against the Company for alleged fraudulent and preferential transfers and claims of the Company against SunEdison, including those outlined in the initial proof of claim filed by the Company in the SunEdison Bankruptcy on September 25, 2016 and on October 7, 2016. Under the Settlement Agreement, all such claims will be mutually released, and, subject to certain exceptions, any agreements between SunEdison Debtors and SunEdison parties to the Settlement Agreement on the one hand and the Company on the other hand will be rejected and no party will be deemed to have liability under those rejected agreements. 
Under the Settlement Agreement, SunEdison will exchange, effective as of immediately prior to the record time for the Special Dividend, all of the Class B units of Terra LLC held by it or any of its controlled affiliates for 48,202,310 Class A shares of TerraForm Power (the “Exchange Shares” and the “Exchange,” as applicable). As a result of and following completion of the Exchange, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock of TerraForm Power will be redeemed and retired. Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, TerraForm Power will also authorize and issue to SunEdison a number of additional Class A shares (the “Additional SunEdison Shares,” together with the Exchange Shares, the “SunEdison Shares”), such that, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, SunEdison will hold an aggregate number of Class A shares equal to 36.9% of TerraForm Power’s fully diluted share number. In addition, also as part of the settlement, SunEdison agreed to deliver the outstanding IDRs of Terra LLC held by SunEdison or certain of its affiliates to TerraForm Power or its designee and in connection therewith, concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, TerraForm Power, Terra LLC, BRE Delaware, Inc. (the “Brookfield IDR Holder”) and SunEdison and certain of its affiliates have entered into an Incentive Distribution Rights Transfer Agreement (the “IDR Transfer Agreement”), pursuant to which certain SunEdison affiliates will transfer all of the IDRs to Brookfield IDR Holder at the effective time of the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in the IDR Transfer Agreement. Our Board approved the Settlement Agreement upon the recommendation of the Conflicts Committee, each member of which is independent (pursuant to applicable NASDAQ rules) and does not also serve on the Board of Directors of TerraForm Global, Inc. 
The Settlement Agreement would also become effective under certain circumstances if the Merger Agreement is terminated as a result of the failure to obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the Class A common stock of TerraForm Power (as described above) and SunEdison elects to exchange its Class B units in Terra LLC and its Class B shares in TerraForm Power for newly issued Class A common stock constituting 36.9% of the aggregate issued and outstanding Class A common stock on a fully diluted basis (a “Stand-Alone Conversion”). In connection with a Stand-Alone Conversion, SunEdison would be required to deliver a customary voting agreement and an irrevocable proxy in customary form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company and the holder of the Class A common stock issued to SunEdison, which may be SunEdison or a third party that receives the Class A common stock as part of a distribution in connection with SunEdison's plan of reorganization. This voting agreement would require the applicable stockholder, for a period of one year from the date of the Stand-Alone Conversion, to vote one-half of its voting power in the same proportion of the votes cast by stockholders not a party to a similar voting agreement, which would effectively reduce the voting power of the applicable stockholder.
Transition Services Agreements 
In the first half of 2017, we entered into certain transition services agreements with SunEdison with respect to project-level operations and maintenance and asset management services provided by SunEdison. These transition services agreements allow the Company, among other things, to hire employees of SunEdison that are currently performing these project-level 
14

services for the Company. These transition services agreements also allow the Company to terminate project-level asset management and operations and maintenance services on 10 days advance notice. Under these agreements, the Company agreed to indemnify SunEdison for certain losses and liabilities to the extent SunEdison failed to perform services under existing services contracts as a result of the transition of SunEdison employees to the Company. SunEdison will also continue to provide certain project related services for a transitional period. The Company is also in the process of negotiating a corporate-level transition services agreement with SunEdison. The Company expects that under this agreement, SunEdison would agree to continue to provide certain corporate-level services, including tax and information technology support services through the end of the third quarter of 2017. At this time, we cannot give firm assurances that we will enter into any such corporate-level transition services agreement with SunEdison. 
Corporate Governance Changes
Resignation of Mr. David Springer from the Board
On December 20, 2016, Mr. David Springer resigned from his position as a director of the Board. The resignation was contingent upon, and effective immediately prior to, the election of Mr. David Pauker as a director of the Board. Mr. Springer’s resignation was not the result, in whole or in part, of any disagreement with the Company.
Election of Mr. David Pauker to the Board
On December 20, 2016, the Board voted to elect Mr. David Pauker to be a member of the Board effective immediately. We believe that Mr. Pauker qualifies as an independent director under applicable stock exchange rules. In connection with the election of Mr. Pauker to the Board, the Board consulted with various parties, including SunEdison, Inc., our controlling shareholder, which suggested Mr. Pauker as a board candidate.
Resignation of Mr. David Ringhofer from the Board
On February 12, 2017, Mr. David Ringhofer resigned from his position as a director of the Board. The resignation was contingent upon, and effective immediately prior to, the election of Mr. Christian S. Fong as a director of the Board.

Resignation of Mr. Gregory Scallen from the Board
On February 12, 2017, Mr. Gregory Scallen resigned from his position as a director of the Board.

In connection with the election of Mr. Fong to the Board, the Board consulted with various parties, including SunEdison, Inc., our controlling shareholder, which suggested Mr. Fong as a board candidate.
Reconstitution of the Conflicts Committee
On February 3, 2017, the Board appointed Ms. Kerri L. Fox and Messrs. Edward “Ned” Hall, Marc S. Rosenberg and David Pauker to the Conflicts Committee, effective immediately upon the resignation of Messrs. Christopher Compton, Hanif “Wally” Dahya and John F. Stark from the Conflicts Committee. Messrs. Compton, Dahya and Stark resigned from the Conflicts Committee on February 3, 2017. On February 26, 2017, Mr. Fong was appointed to the Conflicts Committee. As a result of these changes, the Conflicts Committee consists of five members, Ms. Fox and Messrs. Hall, Rosenberg, Pauker and Fong. Mr. Hall serves as the Chairperson of the Conflicts Committee.
Additionally, on February 3, 2017, the members of the Conflicts Committee of Terra LLC (the “LLC Conflicts Committee”) appointed Ms. Fox and Messrs. Hall, Rosenberg and Pauker to the LLC Conflicts Committee, effective immediately upon the resignation of Messrs. Compton, Dahya and Stark from the LLC Conflicts Committee. Messrs. Compton, Dahya and Stark resigned from the LLC Conflicts Committee on February 3, 2017. Mr. Fong was appointed to the LLC Conflicts Committee on February 27, 2017. As a result of these changes, the LLC Conflicts Committee consists of five 
15

members, Ms. Fox and Messrs. Hall, Rosenberg, Pauker and Fong. Mr. Hall serves as the Chairperson of the LLC Conflicts Committee.
Creation of Compensation Committee
For purposes of the applicable stock exchange rules, the Company is a “controlled company.” As a controlled company, we rely upon certain exceptions, including with respect to establishing a compensation committee or nominating committee. While we remain able to rely upon such exceptions, on February 3, 2017, the Board created a Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”) and appointed Messrs. Stark, Hall and Compton as its members. Mr. Stark serves as the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee.
The Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other matters: (i) reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, (ii) determining, or recommending to the Board for determination, the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation level based on this evaluation, (iii) determining, or recommending to the Board for determination, the compensation of directors and all other executive officers, (iv) discharging the responsibility of the Board with respect to the Company’s incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans, (v) overseeing compliance with respect to compensation matters, (vi) reviewing and approving severance or similar termination payments to any current or former executive officer of the Company, and (vii) preparing an annual Compensation Committee Report, if required by applicable Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules.
Notification Letters from NASDAQ
NASDAQ Listing Rule 5620(a) (the "Annual Meeting Rule") requires the Company to hold an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months of the end of our fiscal year. We did not hold an annual meeting during 2016, and therefore, we are not in compliance with the Annual Meeting Rule. On January 4, 2017, we received a notification letter from a Senior Director of NASDAQ Listing Qualifications, which stated that our failure to hold our annual meeting by December 31, 2016 serves as an additional basis for delisting the Company's securities and that the hearings panel will consider this matter in their decision regarding our continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. On January 11, 2017, we submitted a response requesting an extension to hold an annual meeting and regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Rule. 
On March 6, 2017, we received a notification letter from a Director of NASDAQ Listing Qualifications informing us that because we had not yet filed this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company was not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of periodic reports with the SEC. The letter noted that on February 24, 2017, we filed our Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016, and as a result regained compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). The Notification Letter also noted that, per listing Rule 5815(c)(1)(F), the NASDAQ Hearings Panel may grant us an exception period not to exceed 360 days from the due date of the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, or February 26, 2018. The notification letter had no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
On March 20, 2017, we received a notification letter from a Hearings Advisor from the NASDAQ Office of General Counsel informing us that the hearings panel granted us an extension until June 30, 2017 to regain compliance with NASDAQ’s continued listing requirements with respect to this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017 and our delinquency in holding our annual meeting during the year ended December 31, 2016. On May 12, 2017, we received a notification letter from a Senior Director of NASDAQ Listing Qualifications stating that because we had not yet filed our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017, this served as an additional basis for delisting the Company's securities from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. 
On June 29, 2017, we received a notification letter from a Hearings Advisor from the NASDAQ Office of General Counsel informing us that the hearings panel granted us further extensions to regain compliance with NASDAQ's continued listing requirements. Under these extensions, the Company's Class A common stock will remain listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, subject to the requirement that this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 be filed with the SEC by July 24, 2017, our annual meeting of stockholders be held by August 24, 2017, our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017 be filed with the SEC by August 30, 2017 and our Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2017 be filed with the SEC by September 30, 2017. The hearings panel also requested certain additional information, which the Company provided on July 10, 2017. The hearings panel reserved the right to reconsider the terms of the extension and the NASDAQ Listing and Hearing Review Council may determine to review the hearing panel's decision. This Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 was filed with the SEC prior to July 24, 2017. We have not yet held our annual meeting for 2016 or filed our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017.

Delayed Filing of First Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q
Due mainly to the failure of SunEdison to provide adequate project-level accounting services to us subsequent to the SunEdison Bankruptcy and the time and resources required to complete our delayed SEC periodic reports, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, our Forms 10-Q for the first, second and third quarters of 2016, and this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, we have experienced delays in our ongoing efforts to complete all steps and tasks necessary to finalize financial statements and other disclosures required to be in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017 and were not able to file our report by the SEC filing deadline in May 2017. On May 11, 2017, we filed a Form 12b-25 Notification of Late Filing with the SEC with respect to our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017. We continue to work to complete, as soon as practicable, all steps and tasks necessary to finalize our financial statements and other disclosures required to be included in our periodic filings with the SEC. There can be no assurance that our future periodic reports will not be delayed for similar reasons. Continued delays in the filing of our periodic reports with the SEC could have a material adverse effect on the Company. See "Continued delays in the filing of our reports with the SEC, as well as further delays in the preparation of audited financial statements at the project level, could have a material adverse effect," in Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information, including certain of the risks associated with these delays. 
Sale of substantially all of the Company's U.K. Portfolio
On May 11, 2017, we announced that Terra Operating LLC completed its previously announced sale of a portfolio of 24 operating solar projects    in the United Kingdom representing 365.0 MW (the "U.K. Portfolio") to Vortex Solar UK Limited, a renewable energy platform managed by the private equity arm of EFG Hermes, an investment bank. Terra Operating LLC received approximately $211 million of proceeds from the sale, net of transaction expenses and distributions taken from the U.K. Portfolio after announcement and before closing of the sale, which is expected to be used for the reduction of the Company's indebtedness. The sale also resulted in a reduction in the Company's non-recourse project debt by approximately GBP 301 million at the U.K. Portfolio level. We have retained 11.1 MW of solar assets in the United Kingdom.
Residential Portfolio Sale
We began exploring a sale of substantially all of our portfolio of residential rooftop solar assets located in the United States through a strategic sales process in 2016, and these assets were determined to meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2016. Our analysis indicated that the carrying value of the assets exceeded the fair value less costs to sell, and as a result, an impairment charge of $15.7 million was recognized within impairment of renewable energy facilities in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. We also recorded a $3.3 million charge within impairment of renewable energy facilities for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the decision to abandon certain residential construction in progress assets that were not completed by SunEdison as a result of the SunEdison Bankruptcy. 
On March 14, 2017, Enfinity SPV Holdings 2, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a membership interest purchase and sale agreement with Greenbacker Residential Solar II, LLC for the sale of 100% of the membership interests of Enfinity Colorado DHA 1, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company that owns and operates 2.5 MW of solar installations situated on the roof of public housing units located in Colorado and owned by the Denver Housing Authority. We received net proceeds of $1.1 million upon the closing of this transaction on March 31, 2017. In addition, the Company entered into a membership interest purchase and sale agreement with Greenbacker Residential Solar II, LLC on June 12, 2017 for the sale of 100% of the membership interests of TerraForm Resi Solar Manager, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, which owns and operates 8.9 MW of rooftop solar installations. The transaction closed on June 30, 2017; we received net proceeds of $5.4 million upon closing and expect to receive an additional $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2017.
Upsize to Canada project-level financing 
On November 2, 2016, certain of our subsidiaries entered into a new non-recourse loan financing in an aggregate principal amount of $120.0 million Canadian dollars (“CAD”) (including a CAD $6.9 million letter of credit) secured by approximately 40 MW(ac) of utility scale solar power plants located in Canada that are owned by our subsidiaries. On February 28, 2017, we increased the principal amount of the credit facility by an additional CAD $113.9 million (including an additional CAD $6.7 million letter of credit), increasing the total facility to CAD $233.9 million. The proceeds of this additional financing are expected to be used for general corporate purposes and were used to pay down an additional $5.0 million on the Revolver per the terms of the consent agreement and ninth amendment to the Revolver entered into on September 27, 2016. The revolving commitments and borrowing capacity for the Revolver were also reduced by $5.0 million.
17

Revolver Amendments
The terms of the Revolver require the Company to provide audited annual financial statements within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year, with a 10-business day cure period. On April 5, 2017, we entered into a tenth amendment to the terms of the Revolver, which provided that the date on which we must deliver to the Administrative Agent and other parties to the Revolver our annual financial statements and accompanying audit report with respect to fiscal year 2016 and our financial plan for fiscal year 2017 would be extended to April 28, 2017. 
On April 26, 2017, we entered into an eleventh amendment to the terms of the Revolver, which further extended the due date for delivery of our 2016 annual financial statements and accompanying audit report to the earlier of (a) July 15, 2017 and (b) the tenth business day prior to the date on which the failure to deliver such financial statements would constitute an event of default under our Indentures. As discussed below, an event of default would not have occurred under our Indentures until July 31, 2017. This Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 was filed within the 10-business day cure period that commenced on July 15, 2017, and consequently no event of default occurred under the Revolver with respect to this filing. The eleventh amendment also extended the due date for delivery to the Administrative Agent and other parties to the Revolver for our financial statements and accompanying information with respect to the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 to July 31, 2017 and with respect to the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017 to the date that is 75 days after the end of each such fiscal quarter, with a 10-business day cure period for each quarterly deliverable.
The eleventh amendment amends the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolver credit and guaranty agreement) applicable to the fourth quarter of 2016, and first, second and third quarters of 2017 from 1.75:1.00 to 1.50:1.00. The amendment also amends the Leverage Ratio (as defined therein) applicable to the fourth quarter of 2016 from 6.00:1.00 to 6.50:1.00 and applicable to the first, second and third quarters of 2017 from 5.75:1.00 to 6.50:1.00. In addition, the amendment amends the definitions of Debt Service Coverage Ratio and Leverage Ratio to provide for, in each case, certain pro forma treatment of the repayment or refinancing of Non-Recourse Project Indebtedness (as defined therein) net of any new Non-Recourse Project Indebtedness incurred in connection with any such refinancing. Per the terms of the eleventh amendment, we agreed to prepay $50.0 million of revolving loans outstanding under the Revolver and permanently reduce the revolving commitments and borrowing capacity by such amount. This amount was repaid on May 3, 2017. After giving effect to this reduction, the total borrowing capacity under the Revolver is now $570.0 million.
Senior Notes Default Notices
The Senior Notes due 2023 and the Senior Notes due 2025 require the Company to timely file with the SEC, or make publicly available, audited annual financial statements and unaudited quarterly financial statements no later than 60 days following the date required by the SEC's rules and regulations (including extensions thereof). The Company has a 90-day grace period from the date a notice of default is deemed to be duly given to Terra Operating LLC in accordance with the Senior Notes due 2023 and the Senior Notes due 2025. On May 2, 2017, Terra Operating LLC received a notice from the trustee of an event of default for failure to deliver 2016 audited annual financial statements and thus had until July 31, 2017 to deliver its 2016 audited financial statements before an event of default would occur under the Indentures. However, this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 was filed with the SEC within the grace period for delivery, and consequently no event of default occurred with respect to this filing.
On July 11, 2017, Terra Operating LLC received a notice from the trustee of an event of default for failure to comply with its obligation to timely furnish the Company's Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017. However, an event of default will not occur under the Indentures with respect to the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017 unless such Form 10-Q is not filed within the 90-day grace period that commenced on July 11, 2017.

Call Right Projects
We entered into a project support agreement with SunEdison in connection with our IPO (the "Support Agreement"), which required SunEdison to offer us additional qualifying projects from its development pipeline that represented at least $175.0 million of cash available for distribution. In addition, we entered into an agreement with SunEdison in connection with the First Wind acquisition (the "Intercompany Agreement"), pursuant to which we were granted additional call rights with respect to certain projects in the First Wind pipeline. 
Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to the effectiveness of the Settlement Agreement, the Support Agreement and Intercompany Agreement will be rejected as part of the Settlement Agreement entered into with SunEdison without further liability, claims or damages on the part of the Company. At the closing of the Merger, however, we expect to enter into the Relationship Agreement with Brookfield pursuant to which Brookfield and its affiliates will provide the Company with a right of first offer on certain operating wind and solar assets that are owned by Brookfield and its affiliates and are located in North America and certain other Western European nations.
We believe we continue to maintain a call right over 0.5 GW (net) of interests in operating wind power plants that are owned by a warehouse vehicle that was owned and arranged by SunEdison (the "AP Warehouse"). We believe SunEdison has sold or is in the process of selling its equity interest in the AP Warehouse to an unaffiliated third party, and we are currently evaluating our alternatives with regard to these assets. 
Seasonality and Resource Availability
The amount of electricity produced and revenues generated by our solar generation facilities is dependent in part on the amount of sunlight, or irradiation, where the assets are located. As shorter daylight hours in winter months results in less irradiation, the electricity generated by these facilities will vary depending on the season. Irradiation can also be variable at a particular location from period to period due to weather or other meteorological patterns, which can affect operating results. As the great majority of our solar power plants are located in the Northern hemisphere, our solar portfolio’s power generation will be at its lowest during the fourth quarter of each year. Therefore, we expect our fourth quarter solar revenue generation to be lower than other quarters.
Similarly, the electricity produced and revenues generated by our wind power plants depend heavily on wind conditions, which are variable and difficult to predict. Operating results for wind power plants vary significantly from period to period depending on the wind conditions during the periods in question. As our wind power plants are located in geographies with different profiles, there is some flattening of the seasonal variability associated with each individual wind power plant’s generation, and we expect that as the fleet expands the effect of such wind resource variability may be favorably impacted, although we cannot guarantee that we will purchase wind power facilities that will achieve such results in part or at all. Historically, our wind production is greater in the first and fourth quarters which can partially offset the lower solar revenue expected to be generated in the fourth quarter.
We do not expect seasonality to have a material effect on the amount of our quarterly dividends. Although we are currently deferring a decision on making dividend payments in the prudent conduct of our business, we intend to revert to a situation where we reserve a portion of our cash available for distribution and maintain sufficient liquidity, including cash on hand in order to, among other things, facilitate the payment of dividends to our stockholders. 
Competition
Power generation is a capital-intensive business with numerous industry participants. We compete to acquire new renewable energy facilities with renewable energy developers who retain renewable energy asset ownership, independent power producers, financial investors and certain utilities. We compete to supply energy to our potential customers with utilities and other providers of distributed generation. We compete with other renewable energy developers, independent power producers and financial investors based on our cost of capital, development expertise, pipeline, global footprint and brand reputation. To the extent we re-contract renewable energy facilities upon termination of a PPA or sell electricity into the merchant power market, we compete with traditional utilities and other independent power producers primarily based on low cost of capital, generation located at customer sites, operations and management expertise, price (including predictability of price), green attributes (such as RECs and tax incentives) of renewable power, the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our renewable energy facilities. In our merchant power sales, we also compete with other types of generation resources, including gas and coal-fired power plants.
22

Environmental Matters
We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we own and operate renewable energy facilities. These laws and regulations generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained and maintained both before construction and during operation of these renewable energy facilities. We incur costs in the ordinary course of business to comply with these laws, regulations and permit requirements. While we do not expect that the costs of compliance would generally have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, it is possible that as the size of our portfolio grows we may become subject to new or modified regulatory regimes that may impose unanticipated requirements on our business as a whole that were not anticipated with respect to any individual renewable energy facility. We also do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental compliance for our renewable energy facilities in the next several years. These laws and regulations frequently change and often become more stringent, or subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement, and therefore future changes could require us to incur materially higher costs which could have a material negative impact on our financial performance or results of operations.
Regulatory Matters 
All of the renewable energy facilities located in the United States that the Company owns are QFs as defined under the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended ("PURPA") or Exempt Wholesale Generators ("EWGs"). As a result, they are exempt from the books and records access provisions of the Public Utilities Holding Company Act of 2005, as amended ("PUHCA"), and most are exempt from state organizational and financial regulation of electric utilities. Depending upon the power production capacity of the renewable energy facility in question, our QFs and their immediate project company owners may be entitled to various exemptions from ratemaking and certain other regulatory provisions of the Federal Power Act, as amended ("FPA").
All of the renewable energy facility companies that we own outside of the United States are Foreign Utility Companies, as defined in PUHCA. They are exempt from state organizational and financial regulation of electric utilities and from most provisions of PUHCA and FPA.
The Company owns a number of renewable energy facilities in the United States with a net power production capacity greater than 20 MW (AC). Each project company that owns such a facility that is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"), under the FPA has obtained “market based rate authorization” and associated blanket authorizations and waivers, which allows it to sell electricity, capacity and ancillary services at wholesale or negotiated market based rates, instead of cost-of-service rates, as well as waivers of, and blanket authorizations under, certain FERC regulations that are commonly granted to market based rate sellers. FERC requires market based rate holders to make additional filings upon certain triggering events in order to maintain market based rate authority. The failure to make timely filings can result in suspension of market based rate authority, refunds of revenues previously collected and the imposition of civil penalties.
Under Section 203 of the FPA (“FPA Section 203”), prior authorization by FERC is generally required for any direct or indirect acquisition of control over, or merger or consolidation with, a “public utility” or in certain circumstances an “electric utility company,” as such terms are used for purposes of FPA Section 203. FERC generally presumes that the acquisition of direct or indirect voting power of 10% or more in an entity results in a change in control of such entity. Violation of FPA Section 203 can result in civil or criminal liability under the FPA, including civil penalties, and the possible imposition of other sanctions by FERC, including the potential voiding of an acquisition made without prior authorization under FPA Section 203. Depending upon the circumstances, liability for violation of FPA Section 203 may attach to a public utility, the parent holding company of a public utility or an electric utility company, or to an acquirer of the voting securities of such holding company or its public utility or electric utility company subsidiaries. 
The Company’s renewable energy facilities are also subject to compliance with the mandatory Reliability Standards developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation ("NERC") and approved by FERC. In the United Kingdom, Canada and Chile, the Company is also generally subject to the regulations of the relevant energy regulatory agencies applicable to all producers of electricity under the relevant feed-in tariff or other governmental incentive (collectively "FIT") regulations (including the FIT rates); however it is generally not subject to regulation as a traditional public utility, i.e., regulation of our financial organization and rates other than FIT rates.
As the size of our portfolio grows, it may become subject to new or modified regulatory regimes that may impose unanticipated requirements on its business as a whole that were not anticipated with respect to any individual renewable energy facility. For example, the NERC rules approved by FERC impose fleetwide cyber security requirements regarding electronic and physical access to generating facilities in order to protect system reliability; such requirements expand in scope after the 
23

point at which a single owner has more than 1,500 MW of reliability assets under its control in a single connection and expand again once the owner has more than 3,000 MW under construction. Such future changes in our regulatory status or the makeup of our fleet could require it to incur materially higher costs which could have a material adverse impact on its financial performance or results of operations.
Government Incentives 
Each of the United States, Canada and Chile has established various incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of renewable energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar and wind energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, favorable tax treatment and depreciation, rebates, RECs or green certificates, net energy metering programs and other incentives. These incentives help catalyze private sector investments in renewable energy and efficiency measures. Changes in the government incentives in each of these jurisdictions could have a material impact on our financial performance.
While we are currently subject to lighter regulation than a traditional utility under United States federal or state law and regulations or the laws and regulations of our foreign markets, we could become more highly regulated in the future.
As the owner of renewable energy facilities in the United States, each of which is either a QF or an EWG, we currently are subject to fewer federal and state standards, restrictions and regulatory requirements than would otherwise be applicable to United States utility companies. As our utility-scale business grows, certain facilities may no longer be eligible for exemption under PURPA from the rate-making or other provisions of the FPA, which would require increased compliance with public utility regulations. Similarly, although we are not currently subject to regulation as an electric utility in the foreign markets in which we provide our renewable energy services, our regulatory position in these markets could change in the future. Any local, state, federal or international regulations could place significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business and execute our business plan by prohibiting or otherwise restricting the sale of electricity by us. If we were deemed to be subject to the same state, federal or foreign regulatory authorities as traditional utility companies, or if new regulatory bodies were established to oversee the renewable energy industry in the United States or in our foreign markets, our operating costs could materially increase, adversely affecting our results of operations.
United States
Federal government support for renewable energy 
The federal government provides an uncapped investment tax credit, or “Federal ITC,” that allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30% of qualified expenditures for a residential or commercial solar generation facility, for which construction begins by the end of 2019. This investment tax credit is currently scheduled to gradually be reduced to 10% for solar generation facilities commencing construction before December 31, 2022 with permanence thereafter. The U.S. Congress could reduce the ITC to below 30% prior to the end of 2019, reduce the ITC to below 10% for periods after 2022 or replace the expected 10% ITC with an untested production tax credit of an unknown amount. PTCs, which are federal income tax credits related to the quantity of renewable energy produced and sold during a taxable year, or ITCs in lieu of PTCs, are available only for wind power plants that began construction on or prior to December 31, 2019. The Wind PTC and ITC are extended to 2019 but reduced 20% in 2017, 40% in 2018 and 60% in 2019 before expiring in 2020. PTCs and accelerated tax depreciation benefits generated by operating renewable energy facilities can be monetized by entering into tax equity financing agreements with investors that can utilize the tax benefits, which have been a key financing tool for renewable energy facilities. The federal government also provides accelerated depreciation for eligible renewable energy facilities. Based on our portfolio of assets, we will benefit from Federal ITC, Federal PTC and an accelerated tax depreciation schedule, and we will rely on financing structures that monetize a substantial portion of these benefits and provide financing for our renewable energy facilities at the lowest cost of capital.
State government support for renewable energy

Many states offer a personal and/or corporate investment or production tax credit for renewable energy facilities, which is additive to the Federal ITC. Further, more than half of the states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy facilities that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits. Certain of our renewable energy facilities in the U.S. have been financed with a tax equity financing structure, whereby the tax equity investor is a member holding equity in the limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns the solar generation facility or wind power plant and receives the benefits of various tax credits.
Many state governments, utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer a rebate or other cash incentive for the installation and operation of a renewable energy facility for energy efficiency measures. Capital costs or “up-front” rebates 
24

provide funds to solar customers based on the cost, size or expected production of a customer’s renewable energy facility. Performance-based incentives provide cash payments to a system owner based on the energy generated by their renewable energy facility during a pre-determined period, and they are paid over that time period. Some states also have established FIT programs that are a type of performance-based incentive where the system owner-producer is paid a set rate for the electricity their system generates over a set period of time.
There are 41 states that have a regulatory policy known as net metering. Net metering typically allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar generation facilities to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility’s retail rate for energy generated by their solar generation facility in excess of electric load that is exported to the grid. At the end of the billing period, the customer simply pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more energy is produced than consumed. Some states require utilities to provide net metering to their customers until the total generating capacity of net metered systems exceeds a set percentage of the utilities’ aggregate customer peak demand.
Some of our solar generation facilities in Massachusetts participate in what is known as Virtual Net Metering. Virtual Net Metering in Massachusetts enables solar generation facilities to be sited remotely from the customer’s meter and still receive a credit against their monthly electricity bill. We bill the customer at a fixed rate or for a percentage of the credit they received which is derived from the G-1 electricity tariff. In addition, multiple customers may be designated as credit recipients from a renewable energy facility, provided they are all within the same Local Distribution Company service territory and load zone. The Virtual Net Metering structure provides a material electricity offtaker credit enhancement for our solar generation facilities by creating the ability to sell to hundreds of entities that are located remotely from the renewable energy facility location within the required area. The authority for Virtual Net Metering in Massachusetts was established by the Green Communities Act of 2008 and would require a change in law to repeal the program.
Many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production. There are 29 states that have adopted a renewable portfolio standard ("RPS") that requires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power generation facilities, by a specified date. To prove compliance with such mandates, utilities must procure and retire RECs. System owners often are able to sell RECs to utilities directly or in REC markets.
RPS programs and targets have been a key driver of the expansion of solar and wind power and will continue to drive solar and wind power installations in many areas of the United States. In addition to the 29 states with RPS programs, eight other states have non-binding goals supporting renewable energy.
Canada

Federal government support for renewable energy
While provincial governments have jurisdiction over their respective intra-provincial electricity markets, from 2007 to 2011 the Canadian federal government supported the development of renewable energy through its ecoENERGY for Renewable Power program, which resulted in a total of 104 renewable energy facilities qualifying for funds, and will represent cash incentives of approximately CAD 1.4 billion over 14 years. It also encouraged an aggregate of approximately 4,500 MW of new renewable energy generating capacity. The program is now fully subscribed, and the Canadian federal government has not signaled an intention to renew it.
Provincial government support for renewable energy
Provincial governments have been active in promoting renewable energy in general and solar power in particular through RPS as well as through requests for proposal ("RFPs") and FIT programs for renewable energy. Several provinces are currently preparing new RFPs for renewable energy. Current provincial targets for renewable energy in those provinces with stated targets are outlined below.
Ontario. In 2009, the Green Energy and Green Economy Act, 2009 was passed into law and the Ontario Power Authority (which was merged with and continued as the Independent Electricity System Operator or “IESO,” effective January 1, 2015) launched its FIT program, which offers stable prices under long-term contracts for electricity generation from renewable energy. In November 2010, the Ontario Ministry of Energy released the draft Supply Mix Directive and Long Term Energy Plan. Ontario, one of our markets, has been a leader in supporting the development of renewable energy through the Long Term Energy Plan, which calls for 10,700 MW of renewable energy generating capacity (excluding small-scale hydroelectricity power) by 2018. The Ontario Ministry of Energy is developing the next Long-Term Energy Plan which is 
25

expected to be released in the summer of 2017. Ontario was also the first jurisdiction in North America to introduce a FIT program, which has resulted in contracts being executed for approximately 4,710 MW of electricity generating capacity as of March 31, 2017.
In April and July of 2012, the Ontario Ministry of Energy implemented version 2.0 of the FIT program, which, among other things, reduced contract prices for new solar generation facilities, limited the acceptance of applications to specific application windows, and prioritized projects based upon project type (community participation, Aboriginal participation, public infrastructure participation), municipal and Aboriginal support, project readiness and electricity system benefit. The revisions to the FIT program did not affect FIT contracts issued prior to October 31, 2011. Prices under the FIT program were reviewed annually, with prices established in November to take effect January 1 of the following year. Such price changes did not affect previously issued FIT contracts but, rather, only FIT contracts entered into subsequent to the price change. The revisions had the potential, however, to make renewable energy facility economics less attractive (because of the PPA price reduction) and by granting priority points or status to certain types of renewable energy facilities, to make it more difficult to obtain PPAs.
The FIT program was further renewed by the Ontario Ministry of Energy for FIT 3 (123.5 MW) awarded in the summer of 2014, FIT 3 Extension (100 MW) awarded in December 2014 and FIT 4 (241.4 MW) awarded in the summer of 2016. On April 5, 2016, the Ontario Ministry of Energy directed the IESO to commence a further renewal (FIT 5). The application period for the FIT 5 (150 MW) program closed on November 28, 2016, and FIT 5 contracts are expected to be offered in the third quarter of 2017. On December 16, 2016, the Ontario Ministry of Energy directed that the 2016 application period (FIT 5) shall be the final application period for the FIT program and directed the IESO to cease accepting applications under the FIT program by December 31, 2016. From 2014 through 2016, the FIT program was available for renewable energy facilities from 10 kW to 500 kW. 
There is also a “microFIT” program for renewable energy facilities under 10 kW. On April 5, 2016, the Ontario Ministry of Energy directed the IESO to cease accepting applications under the microFIT program by December 31, 2017. The microFIT program is being transitioned to a net-metering program and on July 1, 2017, amendments to Ontario's net-metering regulation came into effect. 
On June 12, 2013, December 16, 2013, March 31, 2014, and November 7, 2014, the Ontario Ministry of Energy directed the Ontario Power Authority (now the IESO) to develop a new competitive process for the procurement of renewable energy facilities larger than 500 kW. On March 10, 2015 (as amended on June 12, 2015 and July 31, 2015), IESO issued a Request for Proposals for Procurement of up to 565 MW of New Large Renewable Energy Projects, or “LRP I RFP”. The LRP I RFP process concluded in April 2016, with the execution of approximately 455 MW of new wind, solar and water power contracts. On July 29, 2016, the IESO issued a Request for Qualifications for further Large Renewable Procurement ("LRP II RFQ"). The LRP II RFQ process was cancelled by the IESO on September 27, 2016, as directed by the Ontario Ministry of Energy.
Other Provinces. Provincial support for renewable energy in other provinces includes the following objectives:

• | Alberta: To generate 30% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The Government of Alberta announced on March 24, 2017 that the first competition under Alberta's Renewable Electricity Program would open on March 31, 2017, seeing companies bidding to provide up to 400 MW of renewable energy. The Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of this first competition is expected to open on September 15, 2017.


• | British Columbia: To achieve energy self-sufficiency by 2016 with at least 93% of net electricity generation from clean or renewable sources.


• | New Brunswick: To meet 40% of provincial electricity demand with renewable sources by 2020.


• | Nova Scotia: To generate 25% and 40% of net electricity generation from new (post-2001) sources of renewable energy by 2015 and 2020, respectively.


• | Saskatchewan: To achieve 50% renewables-sourced electricity generation by Crown utility company, SaskPower, by 2030. As part of this objective, SaskPower is moving forward with its competitive process for the selection of energy producers for utility-scale solar (10 MW) and wind (200 MW) projects.

Chile

Chile currently has two major electricity grids, the Central Interconnected System (“SIC”) and the Greater Northern Interconnected System (“SING”). A project to inter-connect and unite the SIC and the SING, thus creating a single major electricity grid in the country, called the National Energy System (the "Sistema Eléctrico Nacional", or "SEN"), is currently under construction. According to recent reports, the interconnection is expected to be operational by 2018.
26

As of January 1, 2017, these two main grids (and afterwards the SEN) consolidated their system operations under a single independent system operator, the National Electric Coordinator ("Coordinador Eléctrico Nacional", or "CEN"). The CEN's main functions include ensuring a reliable, adequate supply of electricity into the system, directing the dispatch of generating facilities to assure an efficient, reliable and economic operations, monitoring market competition and payments in the system and reporting on the use of energy from renewable sources. The CEN is subject to the oversight by the National Energy Commission (the "Comisión Nacional de Energía", or "CNE"). 

In 2013, the Chilean government enacted law No. 20.698, which in turn amended law No. 20.257, the Non-Conventional Renewable Energy Law, which promotes the use of non-conventional renewable energy, or "NCRE," and defines the different types of technologies qualified as sources of NCRE as wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and small (<20MW) hydroelectric technology. The law requires that any load serving energy supplier must source a portion of the electricity from NCRE sources.
The current legislation requires that load serving energy suppliers who enter into contracts on or after July 1, 2013, must source at least 9% of their total supply from NCRE generation by 2017. That requirement increases by 1% annually, reaching 12% in 2020, with further increases to reach 20% in 2025. Suppliers can meet their NCRE requirements by developing their own NCRE generation capacity, purchasing from other market participants with excess NCRE credits, or paying the applicable fines for non-compliance.

The current penalty for non-compliance (at the current applicable exchange rate) is approximately US$28 per MWh of deficit with respect to such supplier's NCRE generation obligation, as certified as of March 1st of the following year. The penalty rate increases for the following three years to US$42 per MWh. Should the supplier comply for the following three years, the penalty rate would revert back to the base rate of US$28 per MWh.

On June 22, 2016, Law No. 20.928 was published, establishing a new “tariff parity” system. This system seeks to equalize tariff rates for residential customers both across the country, as well as within a supplier’s residential customer base. The Law and its terms are not yet in force, pending the issuance of the necessary enabling regulations.

Financial Information about Segments
The Company has two reportable segments: Solar and Wind. These segments comprise the Company's entire portfolio of renewable energy assets and are determined based on the management approach. This approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the reportable segments. The Company’s operating segments consist of Distributed Generation, North America Utility and International Utility that are aggregated into the Solar reportable segment and Northeast Wind, Central Wind, and Hawaii Wind that are aggregated into the Wind reportable segment. The operating segments have been aggregated as they have similar economic characteristics and meet all of the aggregation criteria. Corporate expenses include general and administrative expenses, acquisition costs, formation and offering related fees and expenses, interest expense on corporate-level indebtedness, stock-based compensation and depreciation, accretion and amortization expense. All net operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were earned by the Company's reportable segments from external customers in the United States (including Puerto Rico), Canada, the United Kingdom and Chile. 
Customer Concentration
For the year ended December 31, 2016, significant customers representing greater than 10% of total operating revenue were Tennessee Valley Authority and San Diego Gas & Electric, which accounted for 11.2% and 10.0%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues, net.
Employees
Historically, the Company has not had any employees. Through the end of 2016, the personnel that managed our operations (other than our Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer Peter Blackmore, our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Studebaker, and our Interim Chief Accounting Officer, David Rawden) were employees of SunEdison and their services were provided to the Company under the MSA or project-level asset management and O&M services agreements. In a number of cases, the personnel that have been providing services to us have in the past simultaneously provided services to SunEdison and/or TerraForm Global. Following the SunEdison Bankruptcy, as part of our efforts to create a stand-alone corporate organization, we have identified and established a retention program for key employees. As of January 1, 2017, the key employees that provide most of our corporate-level services were hired directly by the Company to ensure continuity of 
27

corporate operations. To date in 2017, we have also hired additional employees who previously were employed by SunEdison and provided services to us, including those focused on project-level operations. However, we continue to depend on a substantial number of outside contractors, including Messrs. Studebaker and Rawden who are employees of AlixPartners, LLP and whose services are provided pursuant to an engagement letter with an affiliate of AlixPartners, LLP, and SunEdison employees for certain of our continuing operations. As of June 30, 2017, the Company had 119 employees, the substantial majority of which were located in the United States.
Except for our Interim Chief Executive Officer, Peter Blackmore, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Rebecca Cranna, our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Studebaker, our Interim Chief Accounting Officer, David Rawden, and a limited number of other employees who continue to serve in the same functions for TerraForm Global for the time being, all other officers of the Company and substantially all of our non-officer personnel provide services exclusively to the Company. For more information regarding our executive officers also serving in the same roles for TerraForm Global, please refer to the risk factor entitled “We may have conflicts of interest with TerraForm Global,” within Item 1A. Risk Factors.
