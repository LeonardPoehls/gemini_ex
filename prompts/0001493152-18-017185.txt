MARKETS
 
Microwave Filter Company, Inc. (MFC)
 
RF and Microwave - This market encompasses both commercial and military applications. Filters in defense applications are used for such purposes as air to ground communications, radar and land communications. In commercial areas, filters are used to protect such equipment as receivers, transmitters, transceivers and any other electronics used for signal processing. In addition to filters, this market is also served with MFC’s Ferrosorb product line. Ferrosorb is a microwave absorbing material available in sheets, loads and a variety of other shapes. The product is used to offer protection by shielding signals or absorbing selective bands.
 
MFC’s RF/Microwave products are sold primarily to Original Equipment Manufacturers that serve the mobile radio, commercial communications and defense electronics markets. The Company continues to invest in production engineering and infrastructure development to penetrate OEM market segments as they become popular. MFC is concentrating its technical resources and product development efforts toward potential high volume customers as part of a concentrated effort to provide substantial long-term growth. The Company is also actively sourcing complimentary products to distribute to augment sales.
 
Satellite - Microwave filters for removing interference are provided for commercial antennas. A variety of products are available that offer protection and or solutions to interference that affects the feedhorn, downconverter and receiver. An extensive offering of filters are also available for satellite services utilizing the higher KU and KA frequency bands. Management expects the demand for these types of filters to continue with the proliferation of earth stations world wide and increased sources of interference.
 
Mobile Radio and Data Links - MFC provides filters to a variety of mobile radio services such as cellular telephone, two way radio and paging to eliminate interference in transmit or receive equipment. More recently there has been demand for filters and diplexers for broadband microwave applications for Voice Over Internet Protocol (“VOIP”) with the number of services increasing and ISP use. The advent of license exempt applications has increased the need for interference filtering. With the number of services increasing and our air waves becoming more congested, filters are increasingly important to many transmit operations.
 
Cable Television (CATV) - The CATV marketplace continues to change as cable operators begin the process of migrating to the latest DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) standard, DOCSIS 3.1.
 
DOCSIS 3.1 continues the evolution of digital CATV systems with the focus of improving spectrum efficiency and providing greater programming flexibility to benefit consumers. These changes move CATV systems from one that is channelized to one segmented into larger frequency blocks. The ultimate goal of DOCSIS 3.1 is to expand the operating frequency capabilities beyond 1700MHz. DOCSIS 3.1 will provide substantial increases in internet speed and allow for increased TV picture resolution; i.e., Ultra High Definition (UHD) or 4K TV and beyond. DOCSIS 3.1 allows CATV operators to remain competitive with their fiber optic counterparts.
 
MFC primarily serves this market with standard and custom filters used at the headend to process signals and remove interference. A very popular application involves removing or re-routing TV channels to organize programming line ups in multi-dwelling facilities (i.e. hospitals, senior living facilities.)
 
Since all cable operators initially receive substantial programming via satellite, products from our satellite market cross over into the cable television market. C-band satellite receive systems are prone to various types of terrestrial interference which are curable in many cases by applying MFC bandpass filters.

Broadcast – MFC continues to develop and expand its series of wireless diplexers.
 
Due to analog to digital conversion within the TV (UHF/VHF) broadcast industry, Microwave Filter Company has developed new filter products to accommodate the wider bandwidths necessary for the digital transmission. In order to accommodate the wider digital TV signal bandwidths, customers have been forced to replace their existing (narrower bandwidth) analog filters with (wider bandwidth) digital filters.
 
As a result of the recent Broadcast Incentive Auction, UHF channels 38-51 have been auctioned off for Internet Service Provider operations. TV Stations within this channel range that wish to continue broadcasting will be relocated to the remaining UHF spectrum of channels 14-36. This reallocation is expected to align well with MFC’s UHF broadcast filters and combining systems as the changeovers take place.
 
MFC also continues to serve other segments of the Broadcast industry such as FM radio, STL (TV Studio-to-Transmitter Links) and the BAS (Broadcast Auxiliary Service) band (formerly known as the ENG (Electronic News Gathering) band.)
 
WORLD TRADE 
 
The Company’s international sales decreased $66,310 or 16.4% to $338,005 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 when compared to international sales of $404,315 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
 
SUPPLIERS 
 
The Company depends on outside suppliers for raw materials, components and parts, and services. Although items are generally available from a number of suppliers, the Company purchases certain raw materials and components from a single supplier. If such a supplier should cease to supply an item, the Company believes that new sources could be found to provide the raw materials and components. However, manufacturing delays and added costs could result. The Company has not experienced significant delays of this nature in the past, but there can be no assurance that delays in delivery due to supply shortages will not occur in the future. Substantial periods of lead time for delivery of certain materials are sometimes experienced by the Company, making it necessary to inventory varied quantities of materials.
PATENTS AND LICENSES
 
The Company has no patents, trademarks, copyrights, licenses or franchises of material importance.
 
SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS 
 
There are no significant seasonal fluctuations in the Company’s business.
 
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS 
 
The Company is not dependent in any material respect on government contracts.
 
SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
 
Sales to one customer represented 32% of total sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 compared to 41.2% of total sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. These sales are in connection with a multiyear program in which the Company is a subcontractor. A loss of this customer or programs related to this customer could materially impact the Company.
