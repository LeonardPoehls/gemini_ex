Dove Diamonds and Mining
 
Dove is currently in the early stages of acquiring diamonds, gems and precious stones from a variety of locations throughout the African continent. Primarily focused on the West African country of Sierra Leone, we are in an organized search for mineral locations, suppliers and sellers of diamonds, gems and precious stones. Dove intends to acquire equipment, mining operations and mining locations, and to establish distribution channels to sell its diamonds to wholesalers and retailers in the United States and globally. Dove has no plans to sell directly to consumers currently.
Millennium Mining, LLC
 
Millennium’s core operations are to mine, extract, refine, and purify precious metals and stones. We intend to buy, sell, distribute and export diamond bauxite, rutile gold, silver and all other precious minerals in Sierra Leone and internationally. Millennium is party to a mining agreement pursuant to which owners of land in the towns of Gandorhun and Njala in the Tikonko Chiefdom, Bo District of Sierra Leone have agreed to allow Millennium to mine the area in and around the Baimbawai Pool of the Sewa River located between those two towns. The Sewa River, located in the heart of Sierra Leone, is renowned for its diamonds production and has been successfully mined for over 50 years. The Sewa River is formed by the junction of the Bagbe and Bafi rivers and it flows 150 mi (240 km) to join the Waanje River and form the Kittam, which empties into the Atlantic Ocean. The country’s most important commercial river, it has historically produced the bulk of Sierra Leone’s diamond exports. 
 
This site in particular has a rich deposit because the pool was never mined properly and has indicated from spot mining that there is a concentration of diamonds. The pool goes down to depths of 90 feet and the gravel is covered by 1-15 feet of sand. So unless an operator has the right equipment, it is very hard to get down to the gravel, especially in the middle of the pool.
 
According to the terms of the mining agreement dated January 26, 2008, Millennium will fund all diamond mining operations, and shall be responsible for all required machinery, mining equipment and/or structures. The landowners who hold the license to mine this area shall be entitled to thirty percent (28%) of the net profits.
 
During the year ended February 28, 2010, we completed the installation of new equipment at the Sewa River facility. Initial testing has produced approximately .4 carats per ton of gravel processed. Management expects to be able to process approximately 1,000 tons per day when sufficient capital is raised to commence and sustain full scale mining operations. Once full scale operations are sustained, management anticipates strong margins as diamond prices continue to average over $250 per carat. However, there is no assurance that sufficient capital will be raised in order to reach such full scale operations.v 
 
Government Regulation and Environmental Control
 
The Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which regulate, among other things, product safety and the discharge, storage, handling and disposal of a variety of substances and wastes, and to laws and regulations relating to employee safety and health, principally the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act and regulations thereunder. The Company believes that it currently complies in all material respects with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and that future compliance with such existing laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, there is no assurance that such requirements will not become more stringent in the future or that the Company will not have to incur significant costs to comply with such requirements.
Competition
 
We compete with other mining companies in connection with the acquisition, exploration, financing and development of diamond properties. There is competition for the limited number of diamond acquisition and exploration opportunities, some of which is with other companies having substantially greater financial resources than we have. As a result, we may have difficulty acquiring attractive diamond projects at reasonable prices. We also compete with other mining companies for mining engineers, geologists and other skilled personnel in the mining industry and for exploration and development equipment.
