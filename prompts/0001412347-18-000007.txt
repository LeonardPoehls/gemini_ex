ITEM 1 | — BUSINESS.

Overview
We are a low-cost producer and marketer of high-value thermal coal to large electric utilities with coal-fired power plants under long-term coal sales contracts. We also market to industrial users, and are the largest producer of surface mined coal in Ohio. We focus on acquiring thermal coal reserves that we can efficiently mine with our large-scale equipment and take advantage of close customer proximity through mine-mouth power plants and strategically located rail and barge transportation. Our reserves and operations are well positioned to serve our primary market areas of the Midwest, Northeast and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. Our operations are located in Ohio and Wyoming. We sold 7.4 million tons of coal in 2017.
Westmoreland Resource Partners, LP is a Delaware limited partnership listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the ticker symbol "WMLP." We began doing business in 1985, in Coshocton, Ohio, as a contract-mining service to a mining division of a major oil company. In 1989, we transitioned from a contract miner into a producer of coal using our own coal reserves. On July 19, 2010, we completed our initial public offering and moved our headquarters to Columbus, Ohio. On December 31, 2014, our general partner was acquired by Westmoreland Coal Company ("WCC"), a Delaware corporation, and our executive offices were moved to Englewood, Colorado. WCC directly owns 100% of our GP and, as of the date of this filing, 93.94% of the beneficial limited partner interest on a fully diluted basis. We are managed by WCC through our GP, and all executives, officers and employees who provide services to us (which are approximately 570 employees) are employed by WCC. WCC’s common stock trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol “WLB.” We conduct our operations through our subsidiaries and our principal sources of cash are distributions from our operating subsidiaries. We operate in a single business segment and have seven operating subsidiaries. See Exhibit 21.1 - List of Subsidiaries for an organizational chart. The following map shows our operations as of the date of this filing:

Properties
During 2017, we operated one surface mine in Wyoming and four active mining complexes in Ohio comprising thirteen surface mines. The Ohio Operations include a river terminal on the Ohio River, two washing facilities, two rail loadout facilities and a tipple facility. The mines are a combination of area, contour, auger and highwall mining methods using truck/shovel and truck/loader equipment along with large production dozers. We own and operate six augers throughout our mining complexes. We also utilize highwall miner systems. We own or lease most of the equipment utilized in our mining operations and employ preventive maintenance and rebuild programs to ensure that our equipment is well maintained. As of December 31, 2017, we had in place leases or subleases to others for approximately 16.6 million tons of the total reserves we owned or controlled. We believe that we have satisfied all lease conditions in order to retain the properties and keep the leases in place.
Our reported proven and probable coal reserves are those we believe can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In determining whether our proven and probable coal reserves meet this economic and legal standard, we take into account, among other things, our potential ability or inability to obtain mining permits, the possible necessity of revising mining plans, changes in future cash flows caused by changes in estimated future costs, changes in mining permits, variations in quantity and quality of coal, and varying levels of demand and their effects on selling prices. The following table provides coal reserve quantities from mines we own or control as of December 31, 2017:
 | December 31, 2017 
 | (In thousands of tons)
Coal reserves1: | 
Proven | 108,786 
Probable | 11,730 
Total proven and probable reserves2 | 120,516 
Permitted reserves | 62,597 
Current year production | 6,642 


1 | The SEC Industry Guide 7 defines reserves as that part of a mineral deposit, which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Proven and probable coal reserves are defined by SEC Industry Guide 7 as follows:

Proven (Measured) Reserves - Reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so close and the geographic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well-established.
Probable (Indicated) Reserves - Reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.

2 | Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of coal that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by our reserve engineers. In addition, the results of mining, testing and production activities may justify revision of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development of reserves. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ from the quantities of coal that are ultimately recovered.

Substantially all of our properties and assets are encumbered by liens securing our and our subsidiaries’ outstanding indebtedness.

Cadiz. The Cadiz complex consists of the Sandy Ridge, Harrison, Daron, and Harrah mines. Coal produced from these mines is either trucked to our Bellaire river terminal on the Ohio River and then transported by barge to the customer, trucked directly to our customer, or trucked to our Cadiz rail loadout facility on the Ohio Central Railroad and then transported by rail to our Barb Tipple crushing and blending facility. After processing at our Barb Tipple facility the coal is delivered by truck to the nearby AEP Conesville power station. A small amount of this coal is also trucked to our Strasburg wash plant and then transported by truck to the customer after processing is completed. These mines use the area, contour, and auger methods of surface mining.
Tuscarawas. The Tuscarawas complex consists of the East Canton, Garrett, Schupp, and Hunt mines. Coal produced from these mines is transported by truck directly to our customers, trucked to our Barb Tipple facility, or trucked to our Strasburg wash plant. The coal is then transported by truck to the customer after processing is completed. These mines use the area, contour, auger and highwall miner methods of surface mining.
Belmont. The Belmont complex consists of the Speidel, Shugert, Buttermilk, and Egypt Valley Wildlife mines. Most of the coal produced from these mines is transported to our Bellaire river terminal on the Ohio River where it is crushed and blended and then transported by barge to the customer. Some of the coal is transported by truck to our Barb Tipple blending and crushing facility and then delivered by truck to the customer. These mines use area, contour, auger and highwall miner methods of surface mining.
New Lexington. The Avondale mine is the only mine currently operating in the New Lexington complex. Most of the coal produced from this mine is transported by truck to our Barb Tipple blending and crushing facility and then trucked to the customer. Some of the coal from this mine is trucked to our Bellaire river terminal where it is crushed, blended, and loaded onto barge for delivery to the customer. This mine uses the area and auger methods of surface mining.
Muhlenberg:  The Muhlenberg complex is located in western Kentucky and is part of the Illinois Basin coal field. We are no longer producing coal from this complex due to adverse market conditions. Though the Muhlenburg complex produced an immaterial amount of coal, final reclamation activities were ongoing at this complex during 2017. 
Kemmerer. The Kemmerer mine in Wyoming transports the coal it produces via conveyor belt to the adjacent Naughton Power Station or it is shipped via short haul rail or truck to various industrial customers. This mine utilizes truck, shovel and dozer surface mining methods.
Customers
In 2017, we derived approximately 67% of our revenues from coal sales to three customers: PacifiCorp Energy, Inc. (34%), American Electric Power Company, Inc. (23%) and East Kentucky Power Cooperative (10%). We sell the majority of our tons under contracts with a weighted average remaining supply obligation term of approximately four years.
Cadiz, Tuscarawas, Belmont, New Lexington, Noble, Plainfield, Muhlenberg and Tusky (collectively, the "Ohio Operations") supply coal under long-term supply contracts to two significant customers, American Electric Power Company, Inc. and East Kentucky Power Cooperative. The AEP contract has an expiration date of December 31, 2018 and payments are based on a fixed-base price per ton of coal to be delivered with adjustments based on quality measurements. The customer has an obligation to purchase a minimum of 750 thousand tons in 2018. There are multiple contracts with EKPC that have expiration dates ranging from March 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Payments under these contracts are based on a fixed-base price per ton of coal to be delivered with adjustments based on quality measurements. The customer has an obligation to purchase a minimum of 840 thousand tons, 480 thousand tons, and 360 thousand tons in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. 
In addition to these agreements, the Ohio Operations provide coal to various other customers under spot or short-term contracts generally based on prevailing market prices.
The Kemmerer mine supplies the adjacent Naughton Power Station owned and operated by Pacificorp Energy, Inc. via conveyor belt under an agreement that expires on December 31, 2021. Prices under the coal supply agreement include a fixed-base price per ton delivered for set minimum quantities each contract year and a lower fixed-base price per ton delivered for optional tons in excess of stated minimums. These fixed-base prices are adjusted quarterly based on changes in various cost and commodity indices. Naughton Power Station’s Unit 3 is scheduled to be shutdown at the beginning of 2019. The customer has an obligation to purchase a minimum of 2.2 million tons in 2018, 1.7 million tons in 2019, and 1.4 million tons in 2020 and 2021, respectively.

The Kemmerer mine also supplies various industrial customers including Genesis Alkali (formerly Tronox Alkali - Green River and Grainger) and Tata Chemicals North America Inc. through contracts with expiration dates ranging from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2026. These industrial customers are supplied via Union Pacific rail and truck. Prices under the supply agreements are fixed-base costs with periodic adjustments based on certain inflation/commodity indices.
Long-term Coal Supply Contracts
As is customary in the coal industry, we enter into long-term supply contracts (one year or greater in duration) with most of our customers. These contracts allow customers to secure an assured supply for their future needs and provide us with greater predictability of sales volumes and prices. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 73.0% of our coal tons sold were sold under long-term supply contracts. We sell the remainder of our coal through short-term contracts and on the spot market.
The terms of our coal supply contracts result from competitive bidding and extensive negotiations with each customer. Consequently, the terms can vary significantly by contract, and can cover such matters as price adjustment features, price reopener terms, coal quality requirements, quantity adjustment mechanisms, permitted sources of supply, future regulatory changes, extension options, force majeure provisions and termination and assignment provisions. Some long-term contracts provide for a predetermined adjustment to the stipulated base price at specified times or periodic intervals to account for changes due to inflation or deflation in prevailing market prices. In addition, most of our contracts contain provisions to adjust the base price due to new statutes, ordinances or regulations that influence our costs of production. Some of our contracts also contain provisions that allow for the recovery of costs impacted by modifications or changes in the interpretations or application of applicable government statutes.
Price reopener provisions are present in several of our long-term contracts. These price reopener provisions may automatically set a new price based on prevailing market price or, in some instances, require the parties to agree on a new price, sometimes within a specified range. In a limited number of contracts, failure of the parties to agree on a price under a price reopener provision can lead to termination of the contract. 
Quality and volume are stipulated in the coal supply contracts. In some instances, buyers have the option to change annual or monthly volumes. Most of our coal supply contracts contain provisions that require us to deliver coal with specific characteristics, such as heat content, sulfur, ash, hardness and ash fusion temperature, that fall within certain ranges. Failure to meet these specifications can result in economic penalties, suspension or cancellation of shipments or termination of the contract.
Royalty Revenues
Oil and Gas Reserves - For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we generated $1.7 million, $0.9 million and $0.9 million in oil and gas royalty revenue, respectively.
Non-Coal Sales Revenues
Limestone Revenues - At our Daron and Strasburg mines, limestone is removed in order to access the underlying coal. We sell this limestone to a third party who crushes it before selling it to local governmental authorities, construction companies and individuals. The third party pays us for this limestone based on a percentage of the revenue it receives from the limestone sales. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we produced and sold 0.4 million, 0.4 million and 0.7 million tons of limestone, respectively. Revenues from these limestone sales were $2.0 million, $1.8 million and $2.9 million for the same time periods, respectively.
Reclamation
Reclamation expenses are a significant part of any coal mining operation. Prior to commencing mining operations, a company is required to apply for numerous permits in the state where the mining is to occur. Before a state will approve and issue these permits, it requires the mine operator to present a reclamation plan which meets regulatory criteria and to secure a surety bond to guarantee reclamation funding in an amount determined under state law. Bonding companies require posting of collateral, typically in the form of letters of credit or cash collateral, to secure the bonds. See Note 5. Restricted Investments to the consolidated financial statements for our cash deposits, restricted investments and reclamation surety bonds. While bonds are issued against reclamation liability for a particular permit at a particular site, collateral posted is not allocated to a specific bond, but instead is part of a collateral pool supporting all bonds issued by a particular bonding company. Bonds are released in phases as reclamation is completed in a particular area.

Competition
The North American coal industry is intensely competitive. In addition to competition from other coal producers, we compete with producers of alternative fuels used for electrical power generation, such as nuclear energy, natural gas, hydropower, petroleum, solar and wind. Costs and other factors such as safety, environmental and regulatory considerations relating to alternative fuels affect the overall demand for coal as a fuel.
The majority of our mines focus on coal markets where we take advantage of long-term coal contracts with neighboring power plants. These mines gives us a competitive advantage based on two factors:

• | we are among the most economic suppliers to our principal customers as a result of transportation advantages over our competitors; and


• | nearly all of the power plants we supply were specifically designed to use our coal.

The Ohio Operations do not compete with producers of metallurgical coal or lignite. However, we do have limited competition from producers of Powder River Basin coal (sub-bituminous coal) in our target market area for bituminous coal. We compete on the basis of delivered price, coal quality and reliability of supply. Our principal direct competitors are other coal producers, including (listed alphabetically) Alliance Resource Partners, L.P., Alpha Natural Resources, CONSOL Energy, Foresight Energy, Hallador Energy Company, Murray Energy Corporation, Peabody Energy Corp., Rhino Resource Partners, L.P. and various other smaller, independent producers.
Washing Facilities
Depending on coal quality and customer requirements, some raw/crushed coal may be shipped directly from the mine to the customer. However, the quality of some raw coal does not allow direct shipment to the customer without putting the coal through a washing process that physically separates impurities from the coal. This processing upgrades the quality and heating value of the coal by generally removing ash, but it entails additional expense and results in some loss of coal. The Partnership owns and operates two washing facilities as follows:

• | Strasburg (Strasburg, Ohio): Throughput capacity of 250 tons of raw coal per hour and operated at a 44.5% utilization rate in 2017;


• | Conesville (Coshocton County, Ohio): The wash plant was idled throughout 2017 due to poor market conditions. This facility is adjacent to a customer’s power plant.

Seasonality
Our coal business has historically experienced variability in its results due to the effect of seasons. We are impacted by seasonality due to weather patterns and our customers’ annual maintenance outages which typically occur during the second quarter. In addition, our customers generally respond to seasonal variations in electricity demand based upon the number of heating degree days and cooling degree days. Due to stockpile management by our customers, our coal sales may not experience the same direct seasonal volatility; however, extended mild weather patterns can impact the demand for our coal. Our sales typically benefit from decreases in customers’ stockpiles due to high electricity demand. Conversely, when these stockpiles increase, demand for our coal will typically soften. Further, our ability to deliver coal is impacted by the seasons. Because some of our mines are mine-mouth operations that deliver their coal production to adjacent power plants, our exposure to transportation delays or outages as a result of adverse weather conditions is limited.
Material Effects of Regulation
Safety
Following passage of The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, amending the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 ("MSHA"), MSHA significantly increased the oversight, inspection and enforcement of safety and health standards and imposed safety and health standards on all aspects of mining operations. There has also been a dramatic increase in the dollar penalties assessed by MSHA for citations issued over the past several years. Most of the states in which we operate have inspection programs for mine safety and health. Collectively, federal, state and provincial safety and health regulations in the coal mining industry are comprehensive and pervasive systems for protection of employee health and safety. Safety is a core value of Westmoreland Resource Partners, LP. We use a grass roots approach, encouraging and promoting employee involvement in safety and accept input from all employees; we feel employee involvement is a pillar of our safety 
10

excellence. Safety performance at our mines was as follows:

 | 2017 | | 2016 
 | Reportable Rate | | Lost Time Rate | | Reportable Rate | Lost Time Rate
WMLP Mines | 1.66 | | | 0.91 | | 0.84 | | 0.28 | 
U.S. National Surface Average | 1.35 | | | 0.78 | | 1.35 | | 0.88 | 
Percentage | 123 | % | | 117 | % | 62 | % | 32 | %

Regulations
We are subject to extensive regulation with respect to environmental and other matters by federal, state, and local authorities in the United States. Regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the following:
U. S. Federal Law and Regulations 
Surface Mining Control & Reclamation Act of 1977 
Clean Air Act 
Clean Water Act 
Endangered Species Act 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act 
Toxic Substances Control Act 
Migratory Bird Treaty Act 
Various other climate change laws and initiatives 

Federal, tribal, state, and local authorities regulate the U.S. coal mining industry with respect to numerous matters, such as protection of air quality, water quality, wetlands, special status species of plants and animals, land uses, cultural and historic properties, and other environmental resources. These laws and regulations have, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on the production and competitive position of the coal industry as against other energy sources. We endeavor to conduct our operations in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. However, non-compliance with federal, tribal and state laws and regulations could subject us to material administrative, civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities, including suspension or termination of operations. In addition, we may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with future laws, regulations or orders as well as future interpretations and more rigorous enforcement of existing laws, regulations or orders, the extent to which we cannot predict. Our reclamation obligations under applicable environmental laws will be substantial. Certain of our coal sales agreements contain government imposition provisions that allow the pass-through of compliance costs in some circumstances.
The change in U.S. Presidential Administration in 2017 has resulted in a number of executive branch initiatives, some of which are discussed below, seeking to reverse the prior Administration’s economic, environmental, and energy-related policies. Because of the uncertainty associated with these initiatives and pending or anticipated legal challenges by states, environmental groups, individuals, and others, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the current Administration’s initiatives on our businesses.
The following is a summary of various U.S. federal laws and regulations that have a material impact on our business:
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act ("SMCRA"). SMCRA establishes minimum national operational, reclamation, and closure standards for all surface coal mines. SMCRA requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and following completion of coal mining activities. Permits for all coal mining operations must be obtained from the federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (“OSM”), or the appropriate state agency if it has obtained regulatory primacy. A state agency may achieve primacy if it develops a mining regulatory program that is no less stringent than the equivalent federal mining regulatory program under SMCRA. All states in which we conduct mining operations have achieved primacy and issue permits in lieu of the OSM. SMCRA permit provisions include a complex set of requirements that include, among other things, coal prospecting, mine plan development, topsoil or growth medium removal and replacement, handling of overburden materials, mine pit backfilling and grading, disposal of excess 
11

spoil, protection of the hydrologic balance, surface runoff and drainage control, establishment of suitable post mining land uses, and re-vegetation. Permitting under SMCRA and its state analogs has generally become more difficult in recent years. This difficulty in permitting affects the availability of coal reserves at our coal mines. 
Under federal and state laws, a mine operator must also assure, usually through the use of surety bonds, payment of certain long-term obligations, including the costs of mine closure and reclamation of the mined land. The costs of these bonds have fluctuated in recent years, and the market terms of surety bonds have generally become more favorable to us. Surety providers are requiring smaller percentages of collateral to secure a bond, which will require us to provide less cash to collateralize bonds to allow us to continue mining. These changes in the terms of the bonds have been accompanied, at times, by an increase in the number of companies willing to issue surety bonds. See Note 10. Asset Retirement Obligations to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of surety bonds posted and cash collateral securing these bonds for reclamation purposes. In addition to the bond requirement, the Abandoned Mine Land Fund-created by SMCRA-imposes a fee on all coal produced. The proceeds of the fee are used to restore mines closed or abandoned prior to SMCRA’s adoption in 1977. The current fee is $0.28 per ton of coal produced from surface mines. In 2017, we recorded $1.8 million of expense related to this reclamation fee.
In January 2016, the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management announced a moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands. On March 28, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth (“EI Order”), which mandated the lifting of the moratorium. On March 29, 2017, the Interior Secretary issued Order 3348, terminating the federal coal-leasing moratorium. 
In December 2016, the OSM published the final Stream Protection Rule to reduce the environmental impact of surface coal mining operations. The rule included the expansion of baseline data requirements and post-mining restoration requirements. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress approved H.J. Res. 38, disapproving the Stream Protection Rule. President Trump signed H.J. Res. 38 on February 16, 2017. On November 17, 2017, the OSM published notice in the Federal Register that it removed the text of the Stream Protection Rule from the Code of Federal Regulations and restored the text of the regulations to that as it appeared on January 18, 2017. The regulations now in effect are those that were in place on January 18, 2017. 
It is our policy to comply in all material respects with the requirements of the SMCRA and the state and tribal laws and regulations governing mine reclamation.
Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and Related Regulations. The CAA and comparable state laws that regulate air emissions affect coal mining operations both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts on coal mining and processing operations include CAA permitting requirements and emission control requirements relating to air pollutants, including particulate matter, which may include controlling fugitive dust. Indirect impacts on coal mining operations include emissions regulations for particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and other compounds emitted by coal-fired power plants. The air emissions programs, regulatory initiatives and standards that may affect our operations, directly or indirectly, include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) Emissions Standards. In August 2015, the EPA finalized standards for GHGs for new, modified, or reconstructed electric generating units ("EGUs") referred to as “new source performance standards” ("NSPS"). The final NSPS for coal-fired EGUs, promulgated pursuant to Section 111(b) of the CAA, require, in most cases, the installation of partial carbon capture and sequestration at new, modified, or reconstructed coal-fired EGUs, which is likely to be a major obstacle to the construction and development of any new coal-fired generation capacity. States and industry challenged the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. However, on March 28, 2017, EPA filed a motion, pursuant to President Trump’s March 28, 2017 EI Order, requesting that the consolidated cases be held in abeyance pending completion of EPA’s review of the rule and any forthcoming rulemaking. On August 10, 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted the motion, holding the cases in abeyance and requiring that EPA submit regular status reports. The EPA’s most recent status report indicates that “[a]t this time, EPA continues to review the 111(b) Rule, as required under the Executive Order.” (D.C. Cir. No. 15-1381; Jan. 25, 2018). 

Existing coal-fired EGUs were also going to be subject to GHG performance standards. The new standards were set to reduce GHG emissions from the power sector by 32% from 2005 levels by 2030. The “Clean Power Plan,” promulgated pursuant to Section 111(d) of the CAA, would impose stringent standards on existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs that reflect the EPA’s assessment of the “best system of emission reduction” ("BSER"). These existing source standards are implemented by the states, requiring that they meet individual GHG emission “goals” beginning 
12

in 2022 with phased reductions through 2030. The final goals have a greater impact on states with substantial coal-fired generation; Wyoming, for example, would be faced with greater than 40% emission reductions from a 2012 baseline. Under the rule, the states had until September of 2016 to submit plans to the EPA to implement and enforce the state-specific BSER, although two-year extensions could be requested. States and industry groups challenged the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and requested a stay pending judicial review. Although the D.C. Circuit denied the stay request, in February of 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the Clean Power Plan pending judicial review of the rule, including potential review by the Supreme Court. The stay delayed implementation of the rule, including the state plan submittal dates. The D.C. Circuit reviewed the rule under an expedited briefing schedule, and an en banc panel heard oral arguments on September 27, 2016. On March 28, 2017, however, the EPA moved to hold the consolidated cases in abeyance pending its reconsideration of the Clean Power Plan, pursuant to President Trump’s March 28, 2017 EI Order. On April 28, 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted the motion and required the EPA to file regular status reports. The EPA’s most recent status report indicates that on October 10, 2017, the EPA “Administrator signed a Federal Register notice proposing to repeal the Clean Power Plan on the grounds that it exceeds EPA’s statutory authority under a proposed change in the Agency’s interpretation of section 111 of the [CAA].” (D.C. Cir. No. 15-1363 Feb. 9, 2018). On March 1, 2018, the court ordered that the consolidated cases remain in abeyance.
Any final rule promulgated by the Trump Administration regarding GHG emission standards will be subject to judicial review. As such, it is unclear whether the appellate process regarding NSPS or the Clean Power Plan will continue. If either rule is upheld in its current form, it is likely that demand for coal will decrease and adversely impact our business.

• | Mercury & Air Toxics Standards. In February 2012, the EPA published national emission standards under Sections 111 and 112 of the CAA setting limits on hazardous air pollutant emissions from coal- and oil-fired EGUs, often referred to as the “Mercury Air Toxics Standards,” or “MATS Rule.” While the MATS Rule generally requires all coal- and oil-fired EGUs to reduce their hazardous air pollutant emissions, it is particularly problematic for any new coal-fired sources. The EPA agreed to reconsider the new source standards in response to requests by industry and published new source standards in April 2013. In June 2013, the EPA reopened for 60 days the public comment period on certain startup and shutdown provisions included in the November 2012 proposal. In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the EPA had failed to properly consider costs when assessing whether to regulate fossil fuel-fired EGUs under the hazardous air pollutant provisions of the Clean Air Act, referring to the agency’s own estimate that the rule would cost power plants nearly $10 billion per year. The D.C. Circuit remanded the rule to the EPA to conduct a cost assessment but without vacatur, allowing the rule to remain in effect while the EPA conducted the rulemaking. On December 1, 2015, the EPA published a proposed supplemental finding that regulation of EGUs is still “appropriate and necessary” in light of the costs to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from the source category. On April 14, 2016, the EPA issued a final rule confirming its “appropriate and necessary” finding to regulate air toxics, including mercury, from power plants after considering costs. The final rule was immediately challenged by several states, companies, and industry groups. Several states and environmental groups also filed as intervenors for the respondent EPA. On April 27, 2017, the D.C. Circuit issued an order holding the consolidated cases in abeyance and directing the EPA to file status reports on the agency’s review of the supplementing finding every ninety days. The EPA’s most recent status report indicates that the “EPA is continuing to review the Supplement Finding to determine whether the rule should be maintained, modified, or otherwise reconsidered.” (D.C. Cir. No. 16-1127; Jan. 19, 2018). 


• | National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for Criteria Pollutants. The CAA requires the EPA to set standards, referred to as NAAQS, for certain pollutants associated with the combustion of coal, such as nitrogen dioxide particulate matter, ozone, and sulfur dioxide. Areas that are not in compliance (referred to as non-attainment areas) with these standards must take steps to reduce emissions levels. Meeting these limits may require reductions of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions. Although our operations are not currently located in non-attainment areas, we could be required to incur significant costs to install additional emissions control equipment, or otherwise change our operations and future development if that were to change. If our customers are located in non-attainment areas or areas that become non-attainment areas, they may also be forced to modify their operations. We do not know whether or to what extent these developments might affect our operations or our customers’ businesses. 

In 2008, the EPA finalized the current 8-hour ozone standard. In October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the ozone standard further (“2015 Rule”). Several industry and business groups, five states, and Murray Energy Corp. challenged the revised standard in the D.C. Circuit. On April 11, 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA’s petition to indefinitely delay oral arguments in the litigation while the agency reviewed the rule. The D.C. Circuit 
13

directed EPA to file status reports on the agency’s review of the 2015 Rule every ninety days. EPA’s most recent status report indicates that it is “continuing to review the 2015 Rule to determine whether the standards should be maintained, modified, or otherwise reconsidered.” (D.C. Cir. No. 15-1385 Jan. 8, 2018).
In a separate lawsuit, a coalition of states and environmental organizations recently challenged the EPA to finalize initial area air quality designations under the 2015 ozone standards. On March 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that the EPA has until April 30, 2018, to finalize the standards for all areas of the country except for the San Antonio, Texas area (which must be finalized prior to July 17, 2018). (N.D. Cal. 4:17-cv-06900 Mar. 12, 2018).

• | Other Programs. A number of other air-related programs may affect the demand for coal and, in some instances, coal mining directly by regulating air emissions emitted by coal-fired EGUs. These include, but are not limited to, the Acid Rain Program, interstate transport rules such as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, the Regional Haze Program, and requirements related to New Source Review. 


• | Effect on Westmoreland Resource Partners, LP. Our mines do not produce “compliance coal” for purposes of the CAA. Compliance coal is coal containing 1.2 pounds or less of sulfur dioxide per million British thermal unit. This restricts our ability to sell coal to power plants that do not utilize sulfur dioxide emission controls and otherwise leads to a price discount based, in part, on the market price for sulfur dioxide emission allowances under the CAA. Our coal also contains about 50% more ash content than our primary competitors, which can translate into a cost disadvantage where post-combustion coal ash must be land filled.

Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and corresponding state and local laws and regulations affect coal mining and power generation operations by restricting the discharge of pollutants, including dredged or fill materials, into “waters of the United States.” Under the National Pollutants Discharge Elimination System and delegated state permitting systems, any discharge of pollutants from a point source into a “water of the United States” requires a discharge permit from the EPA or the state. Additionally, state and local governments regulate nonpoint source pollution through a number of regulatory programs. Under both point source and nonpoint source programs, issuance of permits with more stringent terms and conditions may increase compliance costs for us and our customers.
In January 2017, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the "Corps") issued general nationwide permits for specific activities requiring authorization under Section 404 of the CWA and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. The nationwide permits cover activities that are similar in nature and that are determined to have minimal adverse environmental effects. The permits became effective in March 2017. The Corps reinstated the use of Nationwide Permit 21 for surface coal mining activities. In the event the acreage limits under the permit are exceeded, we will have to obtain individual permits from the Corps, which will increase the processing time for future permit applications.
The CWA provisions and associated state and federal regulations are complex and subject to amendments, legal challenges and changes in implementation. In May 2015, the EPA and the Corps jointly issued a final rule defining “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS Rule”) to clarify which waters and wetlands are subject to regulation under the CWA. Implementation of the WOTUS Rule was stayed nationwide in October 2015, and on February 6, 2018, the EPA published in the Federal Register a rule delaying implementation of the WOTUS Rule by two years (through February 6, 2020). States and environmental organizations are currently challenging the February 6, 2018 rule. Continued court challenges and regulatory actions create ongoing uncertainty over CWA jurisdiction and permitting requirements, which could either increase or decrease the cost and time spent on CWA compliance. New reporting requirements and pending litigation associated with coal combustion residuals may cause power generation customers to face increased costs in complying with the CWA, which could impact demand for our products. Finally, in light of real or perceived efforts toward federal deregulation, the prospect of citizen suits to enforce certain provisions of the CWA may increase, which could result in greater regulatory and litigation costs.
Endangered Species Act. The Federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), and similar state laws, protect any species listed as threatened with extinction and protect their critical habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service works with the OSM and state agencies to administer the ESA and ensures that species subject to its provisions are protected from mining-related impacts. Protection of endangered and threatened species may cause us to modify mining plans or develop and implement species-specific protection and enhancement plans to avoid or minimize impacts to endangered species or their habitats. A number of species indigenous to the areas where we operate are protected under the ESA and equivalent state laws and regulations. Species in the vicinity of our operations may have their listing status reviewed in the future, however, at this time, we do not believe any of these species protections under the ESA or similar state laws will have a materially adverse effect on our ability to mine coal from our properties.

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We may generate wastes, including “solid” wastes and “hazardous” wastes, that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, although certain mining and mineral beneficiation wastes and certain wastes derived from the combustion of coal currently are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The EPA has limited the disposal options for certain wastes that are designated as hazardous wastes under RCRA. Furthermore, it is possible that certain wastes generated by our operations that currently are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes, and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly management, disposal and clean-up requirements.
The EPA determined that coal combustion residuals (“CCR”) do not warrant regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA in May 2000. Most state hazardous waste laws do not regulate CCR as hazardous wastes. The EPA also concluded that beneficial uses of CCR, other than for mine filling, pose no significant risk and no additional national regulations of such beneficial uses are needed. However, the EPA determined that national non-hazardous waste regulations under RCRA are warranted for certain wastes generated from coal combustion, such as coal ash, when the wastes are disposed of in surface impoundments or landfills or used as minefill. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy signed the final rule relating to the disposal of CCR from electric utilities on December 19, 2014, which was published in the Federal Register on April 17, 2015 ("CCR Rule"). The CCR Rule regulates CCR as solid waste under RCRA and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new CCR landfills, surface impoundments and lateral expansions. The criteria include location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post-closure care and recordkeeping, notification and Internet posting requirements. The CCR Rule is largely silent on the reuse of coal ash. In August 2017, EPA released interim final guidance to be used by states developing their own State CCR Permit Programs, under which states may, but are not required to, develop and submit CCR permit programs to EPA for approval. On March 1, 2018, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt issued a pre-publication version of a proposed rule that would amend the CCR Rule. Among other changes, the proposed revisions would allow states or EPA the ability to incorporate flexibilities into their coal ash permit programs. Continued changes in the management of CCR could increase both our and our customers’ operating costs and potentially impact their ability to purchase coal. In addition, contamination caused by the past disposal of CCR, including coal ash, could lead to citizen suit enforcement against our customers under RCRA or other federal or state laws and potentially reduce the demand for coal.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and similar state laws, joint and several liability covering the entire cost of cleanup of a contaminated site, as well as natural resource damages, can be imposed upon current or former site owners or operators, or upon any party who released one or more designated “hazardous substances” at the site, regardless of the lawfulness of the original activities that led to the contamination. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the potentially responsible parties the costs of such action. Although the EPA excludes most wastes generated by coal mining and processing operations from the hazardous waste laws, such wastes can, in certain circumstances, constitute hazardous substances for the purposes of CERCLA. In addition, the disposal, release, or spilling of some products used by coal companies in operations, such as chemicals, could trigger the liability provisions of the statute. Thus, coal mines that we currently own or operate, coal mines that we have previously owned or operated, and sites to which we have sent waste materials, may be subject to liability under CERCLA and similar state laws. We may also be an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been released by previous owners or operators. We may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs of cleaning up facilities at which such substances have been released and for natural resource damages. We have not, to our knowledge, been identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA, nor are we aware of any prior owners or operators of our properties that have been so identified with respect to their ownership or operation of those properties.
Climate Change Legislation and Regulations. Numerous proposals for federal and state legislation have been made relating to GHG emissions (including carbon dioxide) and such legislation could result in the creation of substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. Many of the federal and state climate change legislative proposals use a “cap and trade” policy structure, in which GHG emissions from a broad cross-section of the economy would be subject to an overall cap. Under the proposals, the cap would become more stringent with the passage of time. The proposals establish mechanisms for GHG sources such as power plants to obtain “allowances” or permits to emit GHGs during the course of a year. The sources may use the allowances to cover their own emissions or sell them to other sources that do not hold enough emissions for their own operations. Some states, including California, and regional groups including a number of states in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States that are participants in a program known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (often referred to as “RGGI”), which is limited to fossil-fuel-burning power plants, have enacted and are currently operating programs that, in varying ways and degrees, regulate GHGs.
In addition, the EPA, acting under existing provisions of the CAA, has begun regulating emissions of GHG, including the enactment of GHG-related reporting and permitting rules as described above. However, as discussed above, most of these 
15

regulations are currently subject to judicial review pending the Trump Administration’s review. Demand for coal may also be impacted by international efforts to reduce emissions of GHGs. At this time, the extent to which the United States will participate in international climate change initiatives is unknown. 
The impact of GHG-related legislation and regulations on our business, including a “cap and trade” structure, will depend on a number of factors, including whether GHG sources in multiple sectors of the economy are regulated, the overall GHG emissions cap level, the degree to which GHG offsets are allowed, the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources and the indirect impact of carbon regulation on coal prices. We may not recover from our customers the costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements imposed on us due to limitations in our agreements.
Passage of additional state or federal laws or regulations or international initiatives regarding GHG emissions or other actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions could result in fuel switching from coal to other fuel sources by electricity generators and thereby reduce demand for our coal or indirectly the prices we receive in general. In addition, political and regulatory uncertainty over future emissions controls have been cited as major factors in decisions by power companies to postpone new coal-fired power plants. If these or similar measures, such as controls on methane emissions from coal mines, are ultimately imposed by federal or state governments or pursuant to international initiatives, our operating costs or our revenues may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, alternative sources of power, including wind, solar, nuclear and natural gas could become more attractive than coal in order to reduce carbon emissions, which could result in a reduction in the demand for coal and, therefore, our revenues. Similarly, some of our customers, in particular smaller, older power plants, could be at risk of significant reduction in coal burn or closure as a result of imposed carbon costs. The imposition of a carbon tax or similar regulation could, in certain situations, lead to the shutdown of coal-fired power plants, which would materially and adversely affect our revenues.
We are required to comply with numerous other federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations in addition to those previously discussed. Such additional laws include, for example, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act.
