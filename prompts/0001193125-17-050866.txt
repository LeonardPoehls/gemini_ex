Textile. Reggiani industrial digital inkjet textile printers address the full scope of advanced textile printing with versatile printers suitable for pigmented, reactive dye, acid dye, and water-based dispersed printing ink. Reggiani is at the forefront of the emergence of digital printing as an alternative to either analog printing or single color (dyed) garments. Reggiani provides an overall solution for the entire textile printing process from yarn treatment to fabric printing and finishing for a wide variety of substrates and applications (fashion, home textile, sportswear, signage, flooring, automotive, and outdoor). 
 A significant driver for the adoption of digital textile printing is the growth of fast fashion, which is a term used by fashion retailers to express the need for designs to move quickly from the catwalk to the retailer to capture current fashion trends. The digital textile printing market has also benefitted from sports apparel with short run production quantities, closer geographic proximity to end-use markets, and environmental awareness. 
 Reggiani industrial digital inkjet textile printing systems use water-based inks and advanced streamlined automation that provide a total solution for textile businesses. The TOP digital inkjet textile printer is a fast throughput machine that can be used with reactive, acid, disperse, dye sublimation, and pigmented inks.

We sell a variety of third party branded textile ink to users of our textile digital inkjet printers, including dye sublimation, pigmented, reactive dye, acid dye, and water-based dispersed printing ink. We launched internal formulation of our ceramic digital ink in 2014, which was expanded to included soluble salt-based ceramic ink in 2016. We launched internal formulation of our reactive dye ink in 2016. 
 In 2016, we introduced AquaEndure acqueous ink, which is a water-based inkjet ink that will be used across many of our printers in the future. 
 We acquired Rialco Limited (Rialco) in 2016, which supplies dye powders and color products for the textile, digital print, and other decorating industries. Rialcos pure disperse dyes are particularly important in the manufacture of high-quality dye sublimation inkjet inks for textile applications, which is a key growth area in the global migration from analog to digital print. Rialcos technical and commercial capabilities benefit the Industrial Inkjet operating segment in the sourcing, specification, and purification of high quality dyes and expand our research, development, and innovation base to develop ink for the signage, ceramic, and packaging markets. 
 We accelerated our ink development capability with the purchase of technology from Polymeric Imaging, Inc. (Polymeric) in 2014. Polymeric has extensive experience developing digital inkjet ink and coatings that address important curing, adhesion, density, and durability issues that are encountered when printing on challenging substrates. We use the technology to enhance capabilities for thermoforming and other high-elongation applications.

We expect to continue to expand the scope and sophistication of our products and gain access to new markets and channels of distribution by applying our expertise in these areas. 
Industrial Inkjet 
 Our Industrial Inkjet products are sold primarily through our direct sales force augmented by some select distributors. Any interruption of either of these distribution channels could negatively impact us in the future. See Item 1A: Risk FactorsWe rely on our distribution channels to ensure sales growth.
Textile digital printing is an alternative to either analog printing or single color (dyed) garments. Widespread adoption of digital textile printing depends on the willingness and ability of businesses in the printed textile industry to replace their existing analog printing systems and single color (dyed) garments with digital printing systems. 
 The adoption of digital textile printing is dependent to some extent on the growth of fast fashion, and has also benefitted from sports apparel with shorter production runs, closer geographic proximity to end-use markets, and 
 
11 
 
 environmental awareness. A key element of our inkjet textile printing growth strategy is to market digital inkjet printing systems to contract printers that serve major textile brand owners and fashion designers. 
 The ceramic tile industry has undergone a shift from southern Europe (e.g., Spain and Italy) to the emerging markets of China, India, Brazil, and Indonesia. As a result, we operate a Cretaprint sales and support center in Foshan, Guangdong, China, in addition to our facilities in Spain. Foshan is home to the largest concentration of ceramic tile manufacturers in China. 
 We promote our Industrial Inkjet products through public relations, direct mail, advertising, promotional material, trade shows, and ongoing customer communication programs. The majority of sales leads for our inkjet printer sales are generated from trade shows. There were approximately 1,500 attendees from 25 countries at our 2016 EFI Connect trade show, which generates leads for the Industrial Inkjet and Productivity Software operating segments and generates end user demand for the Fiery segment. We also participated in Drupa, which is the largest printing equipment trade show in the world and is held once every four years. Drupa was attended by over 260,000 attendees from more than 180 countries in 2016. 
 We have established a new e-commerce platform specifically for fabric soft signage production operations. The soft signage on-line ordering technology offers a new level of turnkey flexibility for increasingly popular fabric graphics applications, including outdoor, trade show, and point-of-purchase displays. 
 In 2016, we entered into an agreement with a third party that facilitates our European customers equipment financing. The agreement will provide customers with new leasing opportunities for EFIs industrial digital inkjet printers in many European countries. 
 Productivity Software 
 Our enterprise resource planning and collaborative supply chain business process automation software solutions within our Productivity Software portfolio are primarily sold directly to end users by our direct sales force. An additional distribution channel for our Productivity Software products is through sales to a mix of distribution channels consisting of authorized distributors, dealers, and resellers who in turn sell the software solutions to end users either stand-alone or bundled with other solutions they offer. 
 We have distribution agreements with some customers, including Canon, Konica Minolta, Ricoh, Xerox, Esko, and Veritiv (formerly xpedx). There are a number of small private resellers of our business process automation software in different geographic regions throughout the world where a direct sales force is not cost-effective. 
 We sell Optitex directly to the leading fashion brands and manufacturers through a direct sales force and distribution channels consisting of authorized distributors, dealers, and resellers. 
 Fiery 
 The primary distribution channel for our Fiery products is through our direct relationships with several leading printer manufacturers. We work closely together to design, develop, and integrate Fiery DFE and software technology to maximize the capability of each print engine. The printer manufacturers act as distributors and sell Fiery products to end customers through reseller channels. End customer and reseller channel preference for our Fiery DFE and software solutions drives demand for Fiery products through the printer manufacturers. 
 Although end customer and reseller channel preference for Fiery products drives demand, most Fiery revenue relies on these significant printer manufacturers/distributors to integrate Fiery technology into the design and development of their print engine as described above. See Item 1A: Risk FactorsWe do not typically have long-term purchase commitments with the printer manufacturer customers that purchase our Fiery DFE and software solutions. They have in the past reduced or ceased, and could at any time in the future reduce or cease, to purchase products from us, thereby harming our operating results and business.

12 
 
Our relationships with the leading printer and copier industry companies are one of our most important assets. We have established relationships with leading printer and copier industry companies, including Canon, Seiko Epson, Fuji Xerox, Kodak, Konica Minolta, Kyocera Document Solutions, Landa, OKI Data, Ricoh, Sharp, Toshiba, and Xerox. These relationships are based on business relationships that have been established over time. Our agreements generally do not require them to make any future purchases from us as of December 31, 2016. They are generally free to purchase and offer products from our competitors, or build their own products for sale to the end customer, or cease purchasing our products at any time, for any reason, or no reason. 
 Fiery Self Serve is our self-service and payment solution that is sold to Canon, FedEx Office, Konica Minolta, Ricoh, Staples,, and Xerox. Fiery Self Serve is also marketed to college campuses and libraries. 
 Our proofing products are sold primarily to authorized distributors, dealers, and resellers who in turn sell the solutions to end users either stand-alone or bundled with other solutions they offer. Primary customers with whom we have established distribution agreements include Canon, Xerox, and Heidelberg. There can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully distribute our products through these channels. 
 Growth and Expansion Strategies 
 The growth and expansion of our revenue will be derived from (i) product innovation through internal development efforts or business acquisition, (ii) increasing market coverage through internal efforts or business acquisition, (iii) expanding the addressable market, and (iv) establishing enterprise coherence and leveraging industry standardization. 
 Product Innovation. We achieve product innovation through internal research and development efforts, as well as by acquiring businesses with technology that is synergistic with our product lines and may be attractive to our customers. We expect to expand and improve our offerings of new generations of Industrial Inkjet products, including super-wide and wide format, textile, label and packaging, and ceramic tile decoration industrial digital inkjet printers. We expect to expand and improve our Productivity Software offerings, including new product lines related to digital printing, graphic arts, fulfillment systems, cross-media marketing, image personalization, workflow, packaging, 3D textile design, and print management. 
 We have established relationships with many leading distribution companies in the graphic arts and commercial print industries such as Nazdar, 3M, and Veritiv, as well as significant printer manufacturing companies including Xerox, Ricoh, Canon, and Konica Minolta. We have also established global relationships with many of the leading print providers, such as R.R. Donnelley, Donnelley Financial Solutions, FedEx Office, and Staples. These direct sales relationships, along with dealer arrangements, are important for our understanding of the end markets for our products and serve as a source of future product development ideas. In many cases, our products are customized for the needs of large customers, yet maintain the common intuitive interfaces that we are known for around the world. 
 The development of our Productivity Suite also provides tools to facilitate customer revenue growth, efficient scheduling, and optimization of processes, equipment, and personnel. Customers are provided the financial and technical flexibility to deploy locally within their business or to be hosted in the cloud. 
 Increasing Market Coverage. We are increasing our market coverage through penetration of our sales and distribution networks, expansion into emerging markets in China, India, Latin America and Asia Pacific (APAC), and acquisitions that are synergistic with our other businesses such as the Rialco and Optitex acquisitions. 
 Expanding the Addressable Market. We are expanding our addressable market by extending into new markets within each of our operating segments such as textile digital inkjet printing, textile 3D design, ceramic tile decoration, thermoplastic pre-decoration, image personalization, imposition solutions, various cloud-based 
 
13 
 
 software solutions, self-service and payment solutions, and mobile printing. Further growth in the addressable markets for Industrial Inkjet, Productivity Software, and Fiery has been driven by our development of an integrated VUTEk / Fiery / Productivity Software production workflow. 
 Establish Enterprise Coherence and Leverage Industry Standardization. Our goal is to offer best of breed solutions that are interoperable and conform to open standards, which will allow customers to configure the most efficient solution for their business by establishing enterprise coherence and leveraging industry standardization. 
 We establish coherence across our product lines by designing products and platforms that provide a consistent look and feel to the end user. Cross-product coherence creates higher productivity levels as a result of shortened learning curves. The integrated coherence that end users can achieve using our products for all of their digital printing and imaging needs leads to a lower total cost of ownership. Open architecture utilizing industry-established standards to provide interoperability across a range of digital printing devices and software applications ultimately provides end users with more choice and flexibility in their selection of products. For example, integration between our cloud-based Digital StoreFront application, our Pace business process automation application, and our Fiery XF Production Color RIP including integration to our Fiery or VUTEk product lines, is achieved by leveraging the industry standard Job Definition Format. Our Productivity Suite has taken this integration further through end-to-end automation including certified workflows and synchronized releases across multiple products consisting of our Packaging Suite, Corrugated Packaging Suite, Enterprise Commercial Print Suite, Publication Print Suite, Mid-market Print Suite, Quick Print Suite, and Value Added Products. 
 Recent Business Acquisitions. We achieve product innovation through internal research and development efforts, as well as by acquiring businesses with technology that is synergistic with our product lines and may be attractive to our customers. We also acquire businesses to expand our market coverage and customer base. The impact of our business acquisitions on product innovation, market coverage, and addressable market during 2016, 2015, and 2014 is summarized as follows: 
 

Year | Acquired Business | Acquired Product Line or Customer Base 
2016 | Rialco Limited (Rialco) | Dye powders and color products for digital printing and industrial manufacturing 
 | Optitex Ltd. (Optitex) | Integrated 3D CAD software 
2015 | Reggiani Macchine SpA (Reggiani) | Textile digital inkjet printers 
 | Matan Digital Printers (2001) Ltd. (Matan) | Super-wide format digital inkjet printers 
 | Corrugated Technologies, Inc. (CTI) | Corrugated packaging software 
 | Shuttleworth Business Systems Limited and CDM Solutions Limited (collectively, Shuttleworth) | European customer base 
2014 | SmartLinc, Inc. (SmartLinc) | Shipping and logistics automation software 
 | Rhapso S.A. (Rhapso) | French customer base and corrugated packaging software 
 | DirectSmile GmbH (DirectSmile) | Image personalization, cross media marketing, variable data printing 
 | DiMS! organizing print BV (DIMS) | Multilingual, and multi-national print and packaging companies with a large European installed base

 We will continue to be acquisitive in the future in an opportunistic way supporting our product innovation, market coverage, and total addressable market expansion strategy. 
 
14 
 
Backlog 
 Although we obtain firm purchase orders from our significant printer manufacturer customers in our Fiery operating segment, these customers typically do not issue such purchase orders until 30 to 90 days before shipment. The non-linear nature of our Industrial Inkjet and Productivity Software operating segments results in customer contracts and purchase orders that are not shipped at the end of the year, which are not material and are not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. 
Significant Relationships 
 We have established and continue to build and expand relationships with the leading printer manufacturers and distributors of digital printing technology to benefit from their products, distribution channels, and marketing resources. Our customers include domestic and international manufacturers, distributors, and sellers of digital copiers. We work closely with the leading printer manufacturers to develop solutions that incorporate leading technology and work optimally in conjunction with their products. The top revenue-generating printer manufacturers, in alphabetical order, that we sold products to in 2016 were Canon, Seiko Epson, Fuji Xerox, Konica Minolta, Kyocera Document Solutions, Landa, OKI Data, Ricoh, RISO Global Network, Sharp, Toshiba, and Xerox. Because sales of our printer and copier-related products constitute a significant portion of our Fiery revenue and there are a limited number of printer manufacturers producing copiers and printers in sufficient volume to be attractive customers for us, we expect to continue to depend on a relatively small number of printer manufacturers for a significant portion of our revenue in future periods. Revenue from the leading printer manufacturers was 28%, 33%, and 33% during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Although end customer and reseller channel preference for Fiery products drives demand, most Fiery revenue relies on the leading printer manufacturer / distributors to integrate Fiery technology into the design and development of their print engines. Accordingly, if we experience reduced sales or lose an important printer manufacturing customer, we will have difficulty replacing the revenue with sales to new or existing customers. 
 We customarily enter into development and distribution agreements with our significant printer manufacturer customers. These agreements can be terminated under a range of circumstances and often on relatively short notice. The circumstances under which an agreement can be terminated vary from agreement to agreement and there can be no assurance that these significant printer manufacturers will continue to purchase products from us in the future, despite such agreements. Our agreements generally do not commit such customers to make future purchases from us. They could decline to purchase products from us in the future and could purchase and offer products from our competitors, or develop their own products for sale to the end customer. We recognize the importance of, and strive to maintain, our relationships with the leading printer manufacturers. Relationships with these companies are affected by a number of factors including, among others: competition from other suppliers, competition from their own internal development efforts, and changes in general economic, competitive, or market conditions including changes in demand for our products, changes in demand for the printer manufacturers products, industry consolidation, or fluctuations in currency exchange rates. There can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain or build the relationships we have developed to date. See Item 1A: Risk FactorsWe do not typically have long-term purchase commitments with the printer manufacturer customers that purchase our Fiery DFE and software solutions. They have in the past reduced or ceased, and could at any time in the future reduce or cease, to purchase products from us, thereby harming our operating results and business.
We have a continuing relationship pursuant to a license agreement with Adobe Systems, Inc. (Adobe). We license PostScript® software from Adobe for use in many of our Fiery solutions under the OEM Distribution and License Agreement entered into in September 2005, as amended from time to time. Under our agreement with Adobe, we have a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Adobe deliverables (including any software, development tools, utilities, software development kits, fonts, drivers, documentation, or related materials). The scope of additional licensing terms varies depending on the type of Adobe deliverable. Our current agreement with Adobe was renewed on April 1, 2013 through March 31, 2018. The agreement can be terminated by either 
 
15 
 
 party upon 120 days prior written notice. All royalties due to Adobe under the agreement are payable within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter. 
 Each Fiery solution requires page description language software provided by Adobe, which is a leader in providing page description software. Adobes PostScript® software is widely used to manage the geometry, shape, and typography of hard copy documents. Adobe can terminate our current PostScript® software license agreement without cause. Although to date we have successfully obtained licenses to use Adobes PostScript® software when required, Adobe is not required to, and we cannot be certain that Adobe will, grant future licenses to Adobe PostScript® software on reasonable terms, in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, to obtain licenses from Adobe, Adobe requires that we obtain quality assurance approvals from them for our products that use Adobe software. If Adobe does not grant us such licenses or approvals, if the Adobe licenses are terminated, or if our relationship with Adobe is otherwise materially impaired, we would likely be unable to sell products that incorporate Adobe PostScript® software. If that occurred, we would have to license, acquire, develop, or re-establish our own competing software as a viable alternative for Adobe PostScript ® software and our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed for a period of time. See Item 1A: Risk FactorsWe license software used in most of our Fiery products and certain Productivity Software products from Adobe and the loss of these licenses would prevent shipment of these products.
Our industrial inkjet printers require inkjet print heads that are manufactured by a limited number of suppliers. If we experience difficulty obtaining print heads, our inkjet printer production would be limited. In addition, we manufacture UV curable and ceramic digital ink for use in our printers and rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain pigments used in our ink. Our ink sales would decline significantly if we were unable to obtain the pigments when needed. See Item 1A: Risk FactorsWe depend on a limited group of suppliers for key components in our products. The loss of any of these suppliers, the inability of any of these suppliers to meet our requirements, or delays or shortages of supply of these components could adversely affect our business.
Human Resources 
 As of December 31, 2016, we employed 3,235 full time employees. Approximately 950 were in sales and marketing (including 398 in customer service), 418 were in general and administrative, 658 were in manufacturing, and 1,209 were in research and development. Of the total number of employees, 1,531 employees were located in the Americas (primarily the U.S. and Brazil) and 1,704 were located outside of the Americas. 
Research and Development 
 Research and development expense was $151.2, $141.4, and $134.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, 1,209 of our 3,235 full-time employees were involved in research and development. We believe that development of new products and enhancement of existing products are essential to our continued success. We intend to continue to devote substantial resources to research and new product development. We expect to continue to make significant expenditures to support research and development in the foreseeable future. 
 New platforms and ink formulations will continue to be developed for Industrial Inkjet print technologies and ceramic tile decoration as the industry accelerates its transition from analog to digital technology, from solvent-based printing to UV curable ink printing, and adopts digital textile printing due to the growth of fast fashion. We are developing new software applications designed to maximize work flow efficiencies and meet the needs of graphic arts and commercial print professions, including business process automation, web-to-print, e-commerce, cross-media marketing, imposition, proofing solutions, and 3D textile CAD applications. We are developing products to support additional printing devices including high-end color copiers and multi-functional devices. We have research and development sites in 15 U.S. locations, as well as in India, Europe, Israel, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, China, Australia, and Japan. Substantial additional expense is required to complete and bring to market products that are currently under development. 
 
16 
 
Manufacturing 
 We are leveraging efficiencies in our worldwide digital inkjet printer manufacturing operations by centralizing super wide-format textile digital inkjet printer production in Italy and transferring production of super wide-format roll-to-roll digital inkjet printers to Israel to leverage the lower cost platform that Matan provides. 
 We utilize subcontractors to manufacture our Fiery products and, to a lesser extent, our super-wide and wide format industrial digital inkjet printers. These subcontractors work closely with us to promote low cost and high quality while manufacturing our products. Subcontractors purchase components needed for our products from third parties. We are dependent on the ability of our subcontractors to produce the products we sell. Although we supervise our subcontractors, there can be no assurance that such subcontractors will perform efficiently or effectively. We have outsourced our Fiery production with Avnet, Inc. (Avnet), label and packaging digital inkjet printer production to Roberts Tool Company (Roberts), and formulation of textile ink to third party branded suppliers, with the exception of reactive dye ink. 
 Should our subcontractors experience inability or unwillingness to manufacture or deliver our products, then our business, financial condition, and operations could be harmed. Since we generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our subcontractors and such agreements may be terminated with relatively short notice, any of our subcontractors could terminate their relationship with us and/or enter into agreements with our competitors that might restrict or prohibit them from manufacturing our products or could otherwise lead to an inability or unwillingness to fill our orders in a timely manner or at all. See Item 1A: Risk FactorsWe are dependent on a limited number of subcontractors, with whom we do not have long-term contracts, to manufacture and deliver products to our customers. The loss of any of these subcontractors could adversely affect our business.
Our VUTEk super-wide format industrial digital inkjet printers are primarily manufactured in a single location in our Meredith, New Hampshire facility. In 2016, we transferred VUTEk roll-to-roll printer production to our Rosh HaAyin, Israel, facility, our FabriVu textile digital inkjet printer production to our Bergamo, Italy, facility, and certain wide format industrial digital inkjet printers to our Castellon, Spain, facility. 
 We have encountered difficulties in hiring and retaining adequate skilled labor and management because Meredith is not located in a major metropolitan area. In 2016, we entered into a six-year lease with Bank of TokyoMitsubishi UFJ Leasing & Finance LLC (BTMU) whereby a 225,000 square foot manufacturing and warehouse facility is under construction in Manchester, New Hampshire, related to our super-wide and wide format industrial digital inkjet printer business in the Industrial Inkjet operating segment, which is scheduled to be completed in early 2018. The new manufacturing center will allow consolidation of operations into a single facility and include research & development, manufacturing, warehousing, training, and service for super-wide and wide format printers, along with worldwide sales and marketing management for our broader portfolio of industrial digital inkjet printers and presses. 
 Our Matan super-wide format industrial digital inkjet printers are manufactured in a single location in our Rosh HaAyin, Israel facility. Our Reggiani textile industrial digital inkjet printers are manufactured in a single location in our Bergamo, Italy facility. Our Cretaprint ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printers are manufactured in a single location in our Castellon, Spain facility. Our ceramic digital ink that is used in our ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printers is formulated in a single location in our Ypsilanti, Michigan facility. Our reactive dye ink that is used in our textile digital inkjet printers is formulated in a single location in our Bedford, U.K., facility. 
 Most components used to manufacture our printers and ink are available from multiple suppliers, except for inkjet print heads, branded textile ink, and certain key ingredients (primarily pigments and photoinitiators) for our digital UV curable ink. Although typically in low volumes, many key components are sourced from single vendors. If we were unable to obtain the print heads currently used, we would be required to redesign our printers to use different print heads. If we were unable to obtain the branded textile ink or the pigments required for our digital UV curable ink, we would have to qualify other sources, if possible, or reformulate and test the new ink 
 
17 
 
 formulations. In our Industrial Inkjet facilities, we use hazardous materials to formulate digital UV curable and ceramic digital ink, as well as store internally formulated and third party ink. The storage, use, and disposal of those materials must meet the requirements of various environmental regulations. 
 See Item 1A: Risk FactorsIf we are not able to hire and retain skilled employees, we may not be able to develop and manufacture products, or meet demand for our products, in a timely fashion; We manufacture our super-wide format industrial digital inkjet printers and formulate our ceramic digital ink primarily in single locations. Any significant interruption in the manufacturing process at these facilities could adversely affect our business; We depend on a limited group of suppliers for key components in our products. The loss of any of these suppliers, the inability of any of these suppliers to meet our requirements, or delays or shortages of supply of these components, could adversely affect our business; and We may be subject to environmental-related liabilities due to our use of hazardous materials and solvents.
Significant components necessary for manufacturing our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We depend largely on the following sole and limited source suppliers for our components and manufacturing services: 
 

Supplier | Components 
Intel | Central processing units (CPUs); chip sets 
Toshiba | Application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) & inkjet print heads
Open Silicon | ASICs 
Altera | ASICs & programmable devices 
Tundra | Chip sets 
Avnet | Contract manufacturing (Fiery) 
Controls for Automation Third party branded | Inkjet RFID (radio frequency identification) Textile ink 
(DuPont, Huntsman, Sensient) | 
Ink pigment suppliers | UV curable ink pigments and photoinitiators 
Columbia Tech | Inkjet sub-assemblies 
Schneider Electric | Inkjet electrical sub-assemblies 
Roberts | Contract manufacturing (digital inkjet printers) 
SEI, S.p.A | Laser finishing and winders 
Phoseon | LED lamps 
Shenzhen Runtianzhi Tech | Inkjet sub-assemblies 
Seiko | Inkjet print heads 
Toshiba Tek | Inkjet print heads 
Xaar | Inkjet print heads 
Ricoh | Inkjet print heads 
Kyocera Mita | Inkjet print heads 
Progress Software | Monarch and Radius operating system 
Printable | Digital StoreFront modular offering 

 We generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our component suppliers. We primarily conduct business with such suppliers largely on a purchase order basis. If any of our sole or limited source suppliers were unwilling or unable to supply us with the components for which we rely on them, we may be unable to continue manufacturing our products utilizing such components. 
 The absence of agreements with many of our suppliers also subjects us to pricing fluctuations, which is a factor we believe is partially offset by the desire of our suppliers to sell a high quantity of components. Many of our components are similar to those used in personal computers; consequently, the demand and price fluctuations of personal computer components could affect our component costs. In the event of unanticipated volatility in 
 
18 
 
 demand for our products, we may be unable to manufacture certain products in quantities sufficient to meet end user demand or we may hold excess quantities of inventory due to their long lead times. We maintain an inventory of components for which we are dependent on sole or limited source suppliers and of components with prices that fluctuate significantly. We cannot ensure that at any given time we will have sufficient inventory to enable us to meet demand for our products, which would harm our financial results. See Item 1A: Risk FactorsWe depend on a limited group of suppliers for key components in our products. The loss of any of these suppliers, the inability of any of these suppliers to meet our requirements, or delays or shortages of supply of these components could adversely affect our business.
Competition 
 Competition in our markets is significant and involves rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions. To maintain and improve our competitive position, we must continue to develop and introduce new products and features on a timely and cost effective basis to keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers. We believe the principal competitive factor affecting our markets is the market acceptance rates for new printing technology. 
Industrial Inkjet 
 Our super-wide and wide format industrial digital inkjet printers compete with printers produced by Agfa, Domino, Durst, Canon, Hewlett-Packard (HP), Inca, Mimaki, Roland, and Mutoh throughout most of the world. There are Chinese and Korean printer manufacturers in the marketplace, but their products are typically sold in their domestic markets and are not perceived as viable alternatives in most other markets. Our UV curable ink is sold to users of our UV industrial inkjet printers, which have advanced quality control systems to ensure that correct color and non-expired ink is used to prevent damage to the printer. This results in most ink used in our printers being sold by us. While third party ink is available, its use may compromise the printers quality control system and also voids most provisions of our printer warranty and service contracts. 
 Our Reggiani industrial digital inkjet textile printers compete with Dover, Durst, Mimaki, Roland, Epson, Konica Minolta, Robustelli, Atexco, Shenzhen Homer Textile, Kornit, Brother Industries, and Digital Graphics. Competitive digital inkjet textile printers are manufactured in Italy, Japan, China, and smaller emerging markets such as Indonesia. Key competitors driving digitalization of the textile printer market include Dover, Kornit, and Brother Industries. Reggiani also competes with other digital inkjet textile printing technologies including pre-washing and post-washing printing techniques. 
 Our Cretaprint ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printer competes with ceramic tile decoration printers manufactured in Spain (KERAjet), Austria (Durst), Italy (Technoferrari, Projecta, Intesa, and System), China (Flora, Hope, Meijia, and Teckwin), and smaller emerging competition in other markets such as Indonesia. The ceramic tile industry is experiencing an ongoing relocation from southern Europe to the emerging markets of China, India, Brazil, and Indonesia. Competition in the Chinese market consists of small Chinese ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printers and European manufacturers that are reducing prices to gain market share. In addition to our facility in Spain, we operate a Cretaprint sales and support center in Foshan, Guangdong, China, which is home to the largest concentration of ceramic tile manufacturers in China. 
 Productivity Software 
 Our Productivity Software operating segment, which includes our business process automation, cloud-based order entry and order management systems, cross media marketing, and imposition solution systems faces competition from software application vendors that specifically target the printing industry. These vendors are typically small, privately-owned companies. We also face competition from larger vendors that currently offer, or are seeking to develop, business process automation printing products including HP, Epicor, and SAP. We face competition from Oracle, SAP, Kiwiplan, and Heidelberg in the packaging software market. 
 
19 
 
Our Optitex 3D CAD software competes with Lectra, Assyst, CLO, Browzwear, and Gerber. Optitex provides 2D CAD design and 3D CAD visualization in the same application. Therefore, the CAD information and the 3D information are tightly integrated. Furthermore, the incremental learning curve from using 2D to using 3D is minimal. 
 Fiery 
 The principal competitive factors affecting the market for our Fiery solutions include customer service and support, product reputation, quality, performance, price, and product features such as functionality, scalability, ease of use, and ability to interface with products produced by the significant printer manufacturers. 
 Although we have direct relationships with each of the leading printer manufacturers and work closely with them to integrate Fiery DFE and software technology into the design and development of their print engines to maximize their quality and capability, our primary competitors for stand-alone color DFEs, embedded DFEs, and design-licensed solutions are these same leading printer manufacturing companies. They each maintain substantial investments in research and development. Some of this investment is targeted at integrating products and technology that we have designed and some of this investment is targeted at developing products and technology that compete with our Fiery brand. We are the largest third party DFE developer, although our market compared with DFEs developed internally by the leading printer manufacturers is small. We believe that our advantages include continuously advancing technology, short time-to-market, brand recognition, end user loyalty, sizable installed base, number of products supported, price driven by lower development costs, and market knowledge. We intend to continue to develop new DFEs with capabilities that meet the changing needs of the printer manufacturers product development roadmaps. Although we do not directly control the distribution channels, we provide a variety of features as well as unique look and feel to the printer manufacturers products to differentiate our customers products from those of their competitors. Ultimately, we believe that end customer and reseller channel preference for the Fiery DFE and software solutions drives demand for Fiery products through the printer manufacturers. 
Intellectual Property Rights 
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws; non-disclosure agreements; and other contractual provisions to establish, maintain, and protect our intellectual property rights. Although we believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our business, no single patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret is solely responsible for the development and manufacturing of our products. 
 We are currently pursuing patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions to protect various inventions. Over time, we have accumulated a portfolio of patents issued in these jurisdictions. We own or have rights to the copyrights to the software code in our products and the rights to the trademarks under which our products are marketed. We have registered certain trademarks in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. 
 Certain of our products include intellectual property licensed from our customers. We have also granted and may continue to grant licenses to our intellectual property, when and as we deem appropriate. For a discussion of risks relating to our intellectual property, see Item 1A: Risk FactorsWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary information and may incur expenses to defend our proprietary information.
Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales 
 See Note 14Segment Information, Geographic Regions, and Major Customers and Note 11Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Item 1A: Risk FactorsWe face risks from our international operations and We face risks from currency fluctuations.
