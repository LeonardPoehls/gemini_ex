 Item 1. Business
  
 MusclePharm Corporation, was incorporated in Nevada in 2006. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “the Company,” “we,” “our,” “MusclePharm” or “MP” refer to MusclePharm Corporation and its predecessors and subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. The Company is headquartered in Burbank, California and, as of December 31, 2017, had the following wholly-owned operating subsidiaries: MusclePharm Canada Enterprises Corp (“MusclePharm Canada”), MusclePharm Ireland Limited (“MusclePharm Ireland”) and MusclePharm Australia Pty Limited (“MusclePharm Australia”). A former subsidiary of the Company, BioZone Laboratories, Inc. (“BioZone”), was sold on May 9, 2016.
  
 MusclePharm Corporation is a scientifically driven, performance lifestyle company that develops, markets, and distributes branded nutritional supplements. We offer a broad range of performance powders, capsules, tablets and gels. Our portfolio of recognized brands, including MusclePharm® and FitMiss®, is marketed and sold in more than 100 countries globally. These clinically-developed, scientifically-driven nutritional supplements are developed through a six-stage research process that utilizes the expertise of leading nutritional scientists, doctors, and universities.
  
 On August 24, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a restructuring plan for the Company. The approved restructuring plan was designed to reduce costs and to better align our resources for profitable growth. Specifically, through December 31, 2017, the restructuring plan resulted in: 1) reducing our workforce; 2) abandoning certain leased facilities; 3) renegotiating or terminating a number of contracts with endorsers in a strategic shift away from such arrangements and toward more cost-effective marketing and advertising efforts; 4) discontinuing a number of stock keeping units (“SKUs”) and writing down inventory to net realizable value, or to zero in cases where the product was discontinued; and 5) writing off certain assets. We have now substantially completed the approved restructuring plan, and as such, we do not anticipate any additional significant restructuring related charges.

  Management’s Plans with Respect to Liquidity and Capital Resources
  
  Management believes the restructuring plan, the continued reduction in ongoing operating costs and expense controls, and the aforementioned growth strategy, will enable us to ultimately achieve profitability. We have reduced our operating expenses sufficiently and believe that our ongoing sources of revenue will be sufficient to cover these expenses for the foreseeable future.
  
  As of December 31, 2017, we had a stockholders’ deficit of $12.5 million and recurring losses from operations. To manage cash flow, we entered into a secured borrowing arrangement, pursuant to which we have the ability to borrow up to $12.5 million subject to sufficient amounts of accounts receivable to secure the loan. The agreement’s term has been extended to July 31, 2018. In October 2017, we also entered into a loan and security agreement to borrow against our inventory up to a maximum of $3.0 million for an initial six-month term which automatically extends for six additional months. As of December 31, 2017, we owed $3.0 million on this credit line, of which $1.0 million was repaid subsequent to the end of the year. On November 3, 2017, we entered into a refinancing transaction with Mr. Ryan Drexler, our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, to restructure all of the $18.0 million in notes payable to him, which are now due on December 31, 2019. Accordingly, such debt is classified as a long-term liability at December 31, 2017. For additional information on the refinancing with Mr. Drexler, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Indebtedness Agreements—Related-Party Notes Payable” below.
  
  As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $6.2 million in cash and $2.0 million in working capital.
  
  The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 were prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, they do not give effect to adjustments that could be necessary should we be required to liquidate our assets.
  
  The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and raise capital for specific strategic initiatives could also depend on obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. The Company can give no assurances that any additional capital that it is able to obtain, if any, will be sufficient to meet its needs, or that any such financing will be obtainable on acceptable terms or at all.
  
  Mr. Drexler has verbally both stated his intent and ability to put more capital into the business if necessary. However, Mr. Drexler is under no obligation to the Company to do so, and we can give no assurances that Mr. Drexler will be willing or able to do so at a future date and/or that he will not demand payment of his refinanced convertible note on its maturity date.
  
  We believe that our capital resources as of December 31, 2017, available borrowing capacity and current operating plans will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

  Sales and Marketing
  
  Historically, our advertising and promotion expenses have consisted primarily of digital, print and media advertising, athletic endorsements and sponsorships, promotional giveaways, trade show event participation, and various partnering activities with our trading partners. Prior to our restructuring that began in late 2015, advertising and promotions were a large part of both our growth strategy and brand awareness. We built strategic partnerships with sports athletes and fitness enthusiasts through endorsements, licensing, and co-branding agreements. Additionally, we co-developed products with sports athletes and pro teams. In connection with our restructuring plan, we have terminated the majority of these contracts in a strategic shift away from such costly arrangements, and moved toward more cost-effective brand partnerships, focusing on grass-roots marketing and advertising efforts with athletes and retail outlets closer to our core audience.
  
  In 2017, we have reinvested a portion of those savings into: (1) Building a new elite marketing organization; (2) Deep consumer research to inform everything we do; and (3) A more comprehensive, well-planned, integrated marketing strategy – an attack rooted in a balanced portfolio of owned, earned and paid marketing tactics.
  
  Our goal is to position MusclePharm as the “must have” brand for elite athletes and fitness enthusiasts, alike, who are on a journey to holistically better themselves and achieve their maximum potential. During the third quarter of 2017, we commissioned a 1000-athlete research study, which provided us details about our consumers’ sports nutrition usage patterns, fitness goals, information sources, media consumption habits, key purchases influences, brand awareness and perception, and much more. Since then, we have developed a team of experts – consisting of both in-house employees and external partners – to drive our message to the masses via a well-planned campaign roadmap. Our marketing team members have expertise in areas including content, design, strategy, innovation, social media, search and public relations.
  
  In focusing on our most prominent products, we plan to build breakthrough campaigns that excite our consumer base through proven tactics such as digital marketing, sampling, public relations, athlete/influencer marketing, event marketing, trade activity, paid media, advertising, SEO/SEM, and affiliate marketing. Our roster of elite athletes, influencers and brand evangelists will continue to play a meaningful role and are focused on combat sports (MMA, jiu-jitsu), weight training, CrossFit, football and more.
  
  New product innovation, along with complementary marketing campaigns, will be a key component of driving incremental sales.

  Distribution Channels
  
 The MusclePharm brands are marketed across major global retail distribution channels – Specialty, International and Food, Drug, and Mass (“FDM”). Our largest customers, Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco”) and Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) accounted for approximately 26% and 13% of our 2017 net revenue, respectively. For further information concerning our customer concentration, see Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
  
  Specialty Market: This channel is comprised of brick-and-mortar sales and e-commerce. Due to high competition within this market, we continually seek to respond to customer trends and shifts by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new innovative products and influencing preferences through extensive and strategic marketing. We have seen significant growth in our online sales in 2017 primarily through our Amazon distribution channel.
  
  International: We intend to continue our focus on growing our international presence by continuing to offer new products in key markets as well as opening new distribution channels in select regions of the world. Our international reach touches every relevant market in the world and continues to expand. We are evaluating the benefits of developing expanded manufacturing partnerships outside of North America to take advantage of local opportunities.
  
  FDM: This channel is primarily served by our direct sales force, as well as our network of brokers in specific circumstances. We feel our direct relationships with these retail partners will provide us the best opportunity to expand our distribution into additional discount warehouses and national retailers.
  
  Below is a table of net revenue by our major distribution channel:

 Product Research, Development and Quality Control
  
  Science, product research, and innovation are key factors to our success. Customers’ belief in the safety and efficacy of our products is critical. Continued innovation in delivery techniques and ingredients, new product line extensions, and new product offerings are important in order to sustain existing and create new market opportunities, meet consumer demand, and strengthen consumer relationships. To support our research and development efforts, we invest in formulation, processing and packaging development, perform product quality and stability studies, and conduct consumer market research to sample consumer opinions on product concepts, design, packaging, advertising, and marketing campaigns.

  Our lines of supplements have been developed through a six-stage research process that utilizes the expertise of nutritional scientists, doctors, and universities and strives to assure that all products promote quality and safety for our customers.
 
  We are committed to science and sport being equal in our product development. We believe real-world applications are essential. We are in the process of moving the MP Sports Science Institute from Denver, Colorado to a new state-of-the-art, 20,000 square-foot professional training and performance facility in Burbank, California dedicated to optimizing the performance of our products for all ranges of athletes. We plan to use a variety of measurement devices, including ultrasound, DEXA scans and the Makoto Arena II, all of which measure bone density, body fat, etc., to gather cutting-edge feedback about our formulations. Our capabilities allow us to determine body composition, cognitive function, and multiple performance parameters such as strength, power, and endurance. Collecting data helps our team strive to improve our products and to continue to be innovative.
 
 Our quality control team follows detailed supplier selection and certification processes, validation of raw material verification processes, analytical testing, process audits, and other quality control procedures. Our products are also subject to extensive shelf life stability testing. We also engage third-party laboratories to routinely evaluate and validate our internal testing processes on every MusclePharm product.
 
 We qualify ingredients, suppliers, and facilities by performing site assessments and conducting on-going performance and process reviews. Dedicated quality teams regularly audit and assess manufacturing facilities for compliance Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMPs”), as regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), to ensure our compliance with all MusclePharm, regulatory, and certification standards and requirements. To ensure overall consistency, our quality assurance team adheres to strict written procedures. From the raw ingredient stage to the finished product stage, we monitor and perform quality control checks. Before distributing our products, we place our products under quarantine to test for environmental contaminants and verify that the finished product meets label claims. Once a product has successfully passed quality assurance testing and conforms to specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition, we then conduct testing with third-party laboratories for added label claim verification. Multi-level practices are part of our product development process to ensure athletes and our consumers receive what we believe to be the most scientifically-innovative and safe supplements on the market. Post-distribution, we have standard operating procedures in place for investigating and documenting any adverse events or product quality complaints.
 
 We are committed to the process of having all of our products certified to be banned-substance-free before they are available to consumers. Informed Choice, a globally recognized leader in sports testing, conducts all of our third-party banned substance testing, ensuring that all MusclePharm products are free of banned substances.
  
  Manufacturing and Distribution
  
  We have strategic working relationships with multiple third-party manufacturers, including our former subsidiary, BioZone. Certain of our vendors supply in excess of 10% of our products. Once a product is manufactured, it is sent to our distribution center in Spring Hill, Tennessee, or shipped directly to the customer. All of the third-party manufacturing facilities that we source from and distribution facilities are designed and operated to meet current GMP standards as promulgated by the FDA.
  
  The manufacturing process performed by our third-party manufacturers generally consists of the following operations: (i) qualifying ingredients for products; (ii) testing of all raw ingredients; (iii) measuring ingredients for inclusion in production; (iv) granulating, blending and grinding ingredients into a mixture with a homogeneous consistency; (v) encapsulating or filling the blended mixture into the appropriate dosage form using either automatic or semiautomatic equipment; and (vi) testing finished products prior to distribution.
  
  We maintain and operate a system that integrates with distribution, warehousing, and quality control, providing real-time lot and quality tracking of raw materials, work in progress and finished goods. We employ a supply chain staff that works with sales, marketing, product development, and quality control personnel to ensure that only the highest quality products, that meet the consumer needs, are produced.

  Our Competitors
  
  The nutritional supplements market is very competitive and the range of products is diverse. Competitors use price, shelf space and store placement, brand and product recognition, new product introductions, and raw materials to capture market share.
  
  Our range of competitors include numerous nutritional supplement companies that are highly fragmented in terms of geographic market coverage, distribution channels, and product categories. In addition, large pharmaceutical companies and packaged food and beverage companies compete with us in the nutritional supplement market. Some of these companies have greater financial and distribution resources available to them than us and some compete through vertical integration. Private label entities have gained a foothold in many nutrition categories and also are direct competitors. Our principal competitors are: Cellucor, Dymatize Enterprises LLC, Iovate Health Sciences International Inc., and Optimum Nutrition, Inc.
 
  As many of our competitors are either privately held or divisions within larger organizations, it is difficult to fully gauge their size and relative ranking. We believe that retailers look to partner with suppliers who demonstrate brand development, market intelligence, customer service, and produce high quality products with proven science. We believe we are competitive in all of these areas.
  
  Government Regulation
  
  The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution, and sale of each of our product groups are subject to regulation by one or more governmental agencies. The most active of these is the FDA, which regulates our products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and regulations promulgated thereunder. The FDCA defines the terms “food” and “dietary supplement” and sets forth various conditions that, unless complied with, may constitute adulteration or misbranding of such products. The FDCA has been adjusted several times with respect to dietary supplements, most recently by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (the “NLEA”) and the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994.
  
  FDA regulations relating specifically to foods and dietary supplements for human use are set forth in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations include basic labeling requirements for both foods and dietary supplements. Additionally, FDA regulations require us and our third-party manufacturers to meet relevant good manufacturing practice regulations for the preparation, packaging and storage of our food and dietary supplements.
  
  Our business practices and products are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and the Environmental Protection Agency. Our activities, including our direct selling distribution activities, are also regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold.
  
  In foreign markets, prior to commencing operations and initiating or permitting sales of our products in the market, we may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the country’s ministry of health or comparable agency. Prior to entering a new market in which a formal approval, license or certificate is required, we work extensively with local consultants and authorities in order to obtain the requisite approvals. We must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. Our failure to comply with these regulations can result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market, either temporarily or permanently.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
  We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that protecting our intellectual property is crucial to the continued successful implementation of our business strategy. Since we regard our intellectual property as a crucial element of our business with significant value in the marketing of our products, our policy is to rigorously pursue registrations for all trademarks associated with our products.
  
   
6


  
 
  We have over 70 trademark applications in the United States, 51 of which are currently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Our registered trademarks include registrations of our house marks, as well as marks associated with our core product lines.
  
  We also have filed for protection of various marks throughout the world and are committed to a significant long-term strategy to build and protect the MusclePharm brand globally. We have applied for the “MusclePharm” mark effective in 37 countries, including the United States. The mark has been granted final trademark registration effective in all 37 of those countries.
  
  Seasonality
  
  Our business does not typically experience seasonal variations but revenue may fluctuate based upon promotions. During 2017, our revenue fluctuated mainly due to the discontinuation of various products and product lines as well as certain issues related to our supply chain, which limited availability of certain inventory, and have been resolved on a go-forward basis.
 Employees
  
  As of December 31, 2017, we had 56 total employees, all of whom were full time. None of the employees are represented by a union. Management considers its relations with our employees to be good and to have been maintained in a normal and customary manner.
