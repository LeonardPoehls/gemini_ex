Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a medical technology company that develops, manufactures, and markets non-invasive cerebral and tissue oximeters used in patient monitoring that are consistent with our Vision:
 
"That no patient is harmed by undetected tissue hypoxia."
 
Our principal products are the FORE-SIGHT® and FORE-SIGHT ELITE® brand tissue oximeters and sensors.  With a simple non-invasive adhesive sensor applied to the skin, these products alert clinicians to the oxygenation levels of a patient's brain or other body tissue during medical procedures to avoid harm caused by insufficient oxygen, otherwise known as hypoxia.  The FORE-SIGHT product line represented nearly all of our 2017 sales from continuing operations.  We also sell a small volume of service repairs for legacy products.
 
We believe that our best-in-class FORE-SIGHT tissue oximetry products place CASMED in a unique position both to gain accounts from competitors and expand the clinical application for monitoring tissue oxygenation. Standard non-invasive parameters, such as pulse oximetry and blood pressure, provide only surrogate markers of tissue oxygen delivery.  The indirect or systemic nature of these parameters forces clinicians to infer the adequacy of oxygenation in vital organs, including the brain, during medical procedures.  However, data convincingly show that clinician inferences of cerebral oxygenation during medical procedures often do not correlate with actual tissue oxygenation levels. Therefore, potentially dangerously low levels of cerebral oxygenation often go unrecognized, correlating to high levels of patient harm.  However, direct monitoring of cerebral oxygenation with FORE-SIGHT oximeters provides a unique and powerful tool that allows clinicians to recognize and treat potentially dangerous tissue hypoxia to avoid adverse clinical outcomes.

As clinician education and experience demonstrates that use of cerebral and tissue oximetry improves patient care, the market for these monitors should continue to expand at attractive rates as the industry penetrates what we believe is more than an $800-million addressable market.  We believe the FORE-SIGHT tissue oximeter provides clinicians the most accurate and reliable readings and is well-positioned to compete in that expanding market.
 
Our products are typically sold to hospitals. Clinician users include anesthesiologists, perfusionists, and surgeons in an operating room, and intensivists and nurses in intensive care units.
 
Strategy Execution
 
CASMED completed significant transitions in 2017 and has now successfully executed its multi-year strategic goal of solely focusing on the market opportunity for FORE-SIGHT oximetry.  With the divestiture of its last two non-FORE-SIGHT legacy product lines completed in 2017, the Company's transformation from a low-margin, commodity, capital medical equipment business into a high-growth, high-margin business is now complete, with disposable sensor sales  representing 87% of 2017 sales from continuing operations.
 
Given the unique clinical value of FORE-SIGHT and its position as a best-in-class cerebral oximeter in an expanding market, we believe that continued investment in the FORE-SIGHT opportunity is warranted to drive increases in the Company's enterprise value over the longer term, with material investments in two principal areas First, we have made a substantial commitment to build and improve our entire commercial organization over the last two years.  That effort is now complete.  With sales execution and productivity increasing, the Company returned to double digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter.
 
Second, in addition to our investment in our commercial organization, we continue to fund substantial R&D efforts to continuously improve FORE-SIGHT's industry-leading performance, to develop an OEM FORE-SIGHT module which can materially expand our distribution scale and reach, to reduce product costs and drive gross margins higher, and to fund clinical research that supports the expanding applications of tissue oximetry.
 
Ultimately, we believe, with an improved commercial organization, a growing revenue base, flat operating expenses, and lower product costs, the Company can achieve positive EBITDA in late 2018.
 
Specific 2017 and recent achievements include:
 
 
· | The Company has completed the substantial upgrade of its U.S. field selling organization in order to improve its quality and effectiveness. The field disruptions from that reorganization, which began in 2016, affected the Company's sales results particularly in the first half of 2017 causing what had been multi-year revenue growth to stall. However, the Company's sales organization is now fully staffed with high-quality professionals that are executing well on our sales strategies, gaining tenure and deepening their pipelines of sales opportunities. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2017, this new sales organization placed a record 80 new FORE-SIGHT monitor placements and grew U.S. FORE-SIGHT sales by 18% over the fourth quarter of the prior year. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Worldwide FORE-SIGHT sales rebounded in the fourth quarter of 2017, increasing 12% over the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter, the Company shipped a record net 110 FORE-SIGHT monitors. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We shipped a net of 301 FORE-SIGHT monitors worldwide in 2017, including 198 net monitors in the U.S., raising the U.S. installed base to 1,318 monitors, an increase of 18% over the prior year-end installed base.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The five-year FORE-SIGHT sales compound average growth rate was 18% at the end of 2017 for overall sales and 21% for U.S. sales.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Following a comprehensive multi-hospital evaluation, the Company secured a dual-source supply agreement for cerebral and tissue oximetry with one of the most prestigious hospital systems in the U.S. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company sold monitors and sensors across seven member hospitals of that system covering locations which perform the majority of that system's major cardiac operations. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In early January 2017, the Company completed its obligations under a transition services agreement for its non-FORE-SIGHT, neonatal disposable product line that it had divested to a third party in March 2016.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




 - 5 -
 
 
· | In July 2017, the Company sold its OEM non-invasive blood pressure business to a third party and completed its obligations under a transition services agreement for those products in the fourth quarter The Company is also eligible to receive an earn-out from that transaction of up to $2.0 million in mid-2019 should certain sales targets be met. With these divestitures, the Company is now focused solely on selling its FORE-SIGHT line of tissue oximeters and disposables. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In January 2018, the Company applied for FDA 510(k) approval for its FORE-SIGHT OEM Oximetry Module. The OEM Module permits the use of FORE-SIGHT oximetry without a standalone FORE-SIGHT monitor. The design allows tissue oximetry values to be displayed on a third-party monitor with minimal user-interface modifications. We believe, by partnering with third-party monitoring companies to incorporate FORE-SIGHT oximetry technology through the use of the OEM Module, the Company can open new distribution channels and leverage its selling resources to more quickly expand the market for tissue oximetry. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As a result of the Company's R&D investment to improve sensor design for manufacturability, and coincident with increasing volume commitments with our suppliers, the Company expects substantial product cost reductions will be realized in mid-2018 on its disposable sensor sales as it begins to receive and sell these new lower cost sensors. The full benefit of those cost reductions should be realized by Q3 of 2018.

Description of Products and Services
 
The Company reports two categories of sales within one reportable business unit:
 
 
· | Tissue Oximetry Monitoring – includes sales of the Company's FORE-SIGHT tissue oximeter monitors, sensors, and accessories.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Service and Other – includes sales of service parts and repairs and other miscellaneous sales.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tissue Oximetry Monitoring
 
CASMED's FORE-SIGHT tissue oximeter technology provides clinicians with a simple, non-invasive, quantitative measurement of oxygenation of cerebral tissue typically during surgery or critical care situations.  The percentage saturation of cerebral hemoglobin with oxygen is obtained by placing a sensor on the skin on both the right and the left side of the patient's forehead. The FORE-SIGHT ELITE sensors emit five different wavelengths of infrared light that harmlessly penetrate into the cerebral tissue and are reflected back to photo-detectors in the same sensor.  An exclusive algorithm then determines the percentage of hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen in the blood of the brain tissue underlying each sensor. Through these proprietary and patented processes, FORE-SIGHT provides clinicians with an accurate, absolute numerical measure of tissue oxygenation.
 
In addition to cerebral monitoring, FORE-SIGHT can also be used to monitor the oxygenation of other tissues such as muscle tissues of adults and the abdominal tissues in newborns even weighing less than four kilograms.
 
By non-invasively and continuously measuring absolute cerebral and tissue oxygen levels, our FORE-SIGHT tissue oximeter enables clinicians to identify and quickly react to dangerously low brain oxygen levels and empowers them to provide better care.
 
We believe that FORE-SIGHT incorporates a combination of features that permit obtained oxygenation values to be more reliable and more accurate and, therefore, more actionable by clinicians in critical care environments.
 
 
· | CASMED's FORE-SIGHT ELITE monitor emits five wavelengths of light, permitting an increased level of signal acquisition, thus providing sufficient data to solve for other optical variables in the tissue sample, such as melanin in the skin, which would otherwise confound a tissue oximetry reading.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | CASMED's FORE-SIGHT sensors for adults are designed with a preferred geometry, maximizing the distance between the light source and the farthest photo-detector, thereby providing a light pathway that penetrates deeper into the tissue, giving a greater tissue sample for interrogation, particularly if the grey matter of the brain is farther from the scalp.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | CASMED'S FORE-SIGHT sensors also are maximized for children and come in different configurations with each being tailored precisely to the size of the patient to maximize accuracy and ease of use, all with the preservation of skin integrity in mind.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | CASMED's FORE-SIGHT patented and proprietary algorithm utilizes a combination of methods including a unique on-patient calibration to sort out optical signals created by non-critical background tissue that otherwise confound measurement of oxygenated hemoglobin levels.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | CASMED's FORE-SIGHT algorithms are specifically designed for different body locations given that we believe clinicians' expected levels of accuracy cannot be met with the same algorithm for such materially different physiologies as, for example, that of an adult forehead and that of a newborn's flank.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Monitors that predominantly provide trend-based values differ significantly from the FORE-SIGHT oximeter which provides absolute values.  Trend-based monitors rely upon a baseline measurement from which a declination of some percentage is then considered to be an actionable "desaturation" event.  However, the baseline presumes the patient's oxygenation levels are not already compromised by the introduction of anesthesia, inspired oxygen, existing cardiovascular disease, compromised physiology, or other confounding factors.  Therefore, in those instances where a patient is already ill or is already being treated, a valid baseline measurement may not be available.
 
With FORE-SIGHT's absolute tissue oxygenation measurement, clinicians can have confidence that the value displayed is an accurate reflection of the actual tissue oxygenation to enable clinical interventions once a predetermined absolute threshold is reached (for example, if the oxygen saturation levels drop below an absolute value of 60%).
 
We believe our FORE-SIGHT oximeter helps clinicians solve a serious deficit in the care of many critical care patients.  Unrecognized and dangerous desaturation events occur with much greater frequency than previously known and can only be properly identified with the direct measurement that tissue oximeters provide.  Given this evidence, we believe our best-in-class FORE-SIGHT technology continues to gain clinical adoption in new and existing accounts and is well-positioned in the market for future growth.
 
During 2017, a net total of 301 monitors were shipped worldwide. As of December 31, 2017, the installed base of U.S. monitors was 1,318 monitors, up 18% from the installed base at December 31, 2016. The quantity of "net units shipped" that we report each fiscal quarter adds to this cumulative total and reflects the number of monitors shipped to customers less returns.  The cumulative total is not affected by exchanges or monitor upgrades.
 
The Need for Tissue Oxygenation Monitoring
 
Oxygen is necessary to keep cells viable.  The brain has a very high metabolic rate, consuming approximately 20% of the body's oxygen at rest.  The brain, of course, through cognitive function and memory, defines who we are.  It is also the organ that is least resistant to oxygen deprivation. Lack of sufficient oxygenation in the brain causes neurologic injury such as cognitive impairment, stroke, paralysis, coma, and/or hypoxic encephalopathy.  These injuries can result in severe morbidity or even death. Dangerous deficits in brain hemoglobin saturation (reflecting decreased brain oxygen levels) are termed "desaturation events" because the hemoglobin of the blood is no longer sufficiently "saturated" with oxygen molecules.  Desaturations can be caused by many factors.  The brain responds to insufficient levels of oxygen by increasing ventilation, cardiac output, and blood pressure in order to increase oxygen delivery.  It also vasodilates to increase brain blood flow.  This biologic process is called "auto-regulation".  However, auto-regulation is compromised by illness, surgical intervention, trauma, and anesthesia; and neonates and children have immature auto-regulation capabilities.

Inadequate oxygen delivery to the brain can be caused by:
 
 
· | Hypoxemia: a decrease of hemoglobin oxygen saturation in arterial blood (inadequate oxygenation of the supply);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ischemia: a decrease in blood flow to the brain caused by inadequate cardiac output, occlusion of cerebral vessels, or increased intracranial pressure (inadequate volume of supply); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Anemia: a decrease in the concentration of red blood cells in the blood (inadequate oxygen carrying capacity).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Oxygen delivery must also match oxygen consumption related to the metabolic rate of the brain.
 
Most conventional monitoring is ultimately employed to assure an adequate balance between oxygen supply and demand.  Reliably measuring the impact of complicated interactions among factors affecting cerebral oxygenation requires unacceptably invasive techniques.  Standard parameters, such as pulse oximetry, heart rate and blood pressure determinations, capnometry, and cardiac output assessment, each provide only indirect predictions of cerebral oxygenation.  From that information, a clinician can only infer that a patient's brain inadequately oxygenated.  Data from cerebral oximetry convincingly shows that the estimations clinicians make about cerebral oxygenation based solely on these indirect measures are frequently wrong and that threatening cerebral desaturation events occur without recognition.   Thus, in many acute care settings, such as surgery, intensive care, and other critical care environments, patients are exposed to potentially damaging cerebral hypoxia that could likely be prevented if recognized.

Data in support of this clinical proposition is substantial.  FORE-SIGHT and FORE-SIGHT ELITE have been well validated with FDA-compliant methods.  FORE-SIGHT also has proven to have high levels of accuracy even when compared to competitive technologies.  The incidence rate of cerebral desaturation events (CDE's) is very high and is prevalent in many common surgeries as indicated in the sampling of studies cited in the following table.

The harm associated with these cerebral desaturations is well documented. Low levels of cerebral oxygen saturation correlate to poorer outcomes such as:  post-operative nausea; cognitive impairment including memory loss; longer lengths of stay; stroke; and even death. Yet, very simple interventions are available to clinicians to successfully reverse these low levels of oxygen.  Standard interventions include eliminating mechanical blockage, increasing inspired oxygen levels, increasing blood flow or blood pressures, or transfusing units of blood.  When clinicians are alerted to CDEs and do successfully intervene to reverse low levels of brain oxygenation, patient outcomes improve.
 
This solid and growing body of clinical evidence substantiates the premise that measuring cerebral oximetry offers valuable insight to clinicians during the management of critical care patients which could permit them to increase safety, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce costs.
 
The Market for Tissue Oximetry
 
Cerebral desaturation events occur with much greater frequency than previously believed.  The large and growing body of published literature in support of cerebral oximetry provides a solid academic and data-driven support for the expanded use of the product in a variety of critical care settings including: heart surgery; lung surgery; major vascular surgery; neurosurgery; surgeries that provide a risk of large blood loss, such as orthopedic hip and spine; surgeries on elderly patients or those with compromised vascular systems or other co-morbidities; surgeries with non-supine patient positioning, such as orthopedic "beach chair" shoulder surgery and bariatric surgery; trauma care; cardiac arrest; and intensive care patient management in adult, pediatric, and neonatal wards, among others. Therefore, in the U.S. alone, cerebral monitoring could safeguard millions of patients each year.

While we believe the eventual addressable market for tissue oximetry exceeds $800 million, we estimate current total worldwide annual sales of tissue oximetry to be approximately $125 million.  Given the broad potential applicability of this parameter and the small current rate of market penetration, we also believe that market rates of growth can accelerate, particularly as the use of oximetry moves toward becoming a standard of care.
 
The literature in support of tissue oximetry, in general, and FORE-SIGHT oximetry, in particular, will play an increasingly important role in the expansion of the tissue oximetry market as clinicians continue to be educated regarding the potential benefits of this parameter.  Consequently, a significant part of our longer-term strategy is to continue to encourage and support research related to the need for cerebral oximetry and its efficacy in improving care.  FORE-SIGHT has already been referenced in hundreds of papers, abstracts, and posters, and the literature in support of the product grows every year.

Government Regulation
 
Medical products of the type currently being marketed and under development by the Company are subject to regulation under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the "FD&C Act") and numerous acts and amendments such as the Quality System Regulations ("QSR").
 
 - 11 -
 
In addition, depending upon product type, the Company must also comply with those regulations governing the Conduct of Human Investigations, Pre‑Market Notification Regulations, and other requirements, as promulgated by the FDA.  The FDA is authorized to inspect a device, its labeling and advertising, and the facilities in which it is manufactured, in order to ensure that the device is not manufactured or labeled in a manner which could cause it to be in violation of the FD&C Act.
 
The FDA has adopted regulations which classify medical devices based upon the degree of regulation believed necessary to assure safety and efficacy.  A device is classified as a Class I, II, or III device.  Class I devices are subject only to general controls.  Class II devices, in addition to general controls, are or will be subject to "performance standards."  Most devices are also subject to the 510(k) pre‑market notification provision.  In addition, some Class III devices require FDA pre‑market studies before they may be marketed commercially because their safety and effectiveness cannot be assured by the general controls and performance standards of Class I or II devices.
 
The Company's products are Class II devices, and most require FDA clearance under Section 510(k) of the FD&C Act.
 
The last factory inspection of the Company by the FDA occurred during April 2016.  The inspection resulted in an FDA-483 Inspection Observation Report which listed various non-conformities.  The Company provided a written response to those observations.  The FDA, satisfied with the Company's response and the related actions taken, closed the inspection on June 2, 2016.
 
International Regulatory Compliance
 
CASMED maintains certification to ISO 13485:2003 by the Notified Body, BSI Inc., for its manufacturing facility. These certifications and compliance with the Medical Device Directive allow CASMED to use the "CE" mark on its products.  The CE mark is required for medical devices to gain access to the European Union ("EU") common market and other non-EU markets as well.  The FDA, recognizing the value of this universally-accepted quality system, has patterned its Quality System Regulations after ISO 9001 and ISO 13485. CASMED maintains full compliance with ISO 13485:2003 and the EU's Medical Device Directive, as evaluated by annual assessment.
Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
 
The Company assembles, tests, packages, or ships its products from its facility in Branford, Connecticut.  The various finished goods or components for the products, which include plastic moldings, wire, printed circuit boards, sub-assemblies, and many other parts, are obtained from outside vendors, some of which are outside of the United States.  The Company has not experienced any sustained interruption in production or the supply of components and does not anticipate any difficulties in obtaining the components necessary to manufacture its products.
 
Quality assurance procedures are performed by the Company at its Branford, Connecticut, facility and at its suppliers' facilities to standards set forth in the FDA's "Quality System Regulations".  These procedures include the initial qualification of the supplier, inspection of components, and testing of finished goods.
 
Customers
 
Our five largest customers accounted for approximately 14% and 15% of sales from continuing operations in 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Each of these customers accounted for less than 10% of sales from continuing operations.
Backlog
 
The Company's backlog generally includes orders for products shippable on a current basis.  The majority of the Company orders are shipped within several days of customer purchase order acceptance. Total backlog, therefore, is not a meaningful indicator of the Company's future sales.
