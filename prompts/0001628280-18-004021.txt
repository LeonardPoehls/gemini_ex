Bank revenues are derived from interest and fees received in connection with loans, deposits, and investments. Major expenses of the Bank consist of personnel, interest paid on deposits and borrowings, and other operating expenses. Revenues from the Mortgage Division consist primarily of gains from the sale of loans and loan origination fees. Major expenses of the Mortgage Division consist of personnel, investor fees, and other operating expenses. Revenue generated by the Bank (excluding the Mortgage Division) totaled $101.0 million in 2017. The Mortgage Division contributed $20.8 million; others contributed $7.5 million prior to inter-company eliminations. 
The economy, interest rates, monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, and regulatory policies have a significant influence on the Corporation, the Bank, the Mortgage Division, Middleburg Trust Company, ACM, and the banking industry as a whole. The economy shows continued signs of improvement with the national unemployment rate dropping from 4.7% in December 2016 to 4.1% in December 2017. In December 2017, the federal funds rate increased from 1.25% to 1.50%, the fifth increase in federal funds rates since December 2008 and the third increase during 2017. In March 2018, the Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) announced an additional 0.25% rate hike bringing the federal funds rate to 1.75%. This decision was based on strengthening in the labor market and continued increases in economic activity. Even with these rate hikes, the continued low rate environment will continue to stress net interest margins as competition in the banking industry tightens.
The Bank operates from fifteen banking centers located in Virginia: Chantilly, Tysons, Reston, Leesburg (two locations), Manassas, Arlington, Alexandria, Ashburn, Gainesville, Marshall, Middleburg, Purcellville, Richmond and Warrenton and online at www.accessnationalbank.com. 
The Mortgage Division specializes in the origination of conforming and government insured residential mortgages to individuals in the greater Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area, the surrounding areas of its branch locations, outside of its local markets via direct mail solicitation, and otherwise. The Mortgage Division has established offices throughout Virginia; in Fairfax, Reston, Roanoke, and McLean. Offices outside the state of Virginia include Carmel and Fort Wayne in Indiana, Nashville in Tennessee, Hagerstown in Maryland, Atlanta in Georgia, and Independence in Ohio.
The following table details the geographic distribution of the real estate collateral securing mortgage loans originated by the Mortgage Division in the periods indicated. The individually named states are those in which the Mortgage Division had a physical presence during the periods described.

The Mortgage Division’s activities rely on insurance provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and the Veterans Administration. In addition we underwrite mortgage loans in accordance with guidelines for programs under Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that make these loans marketable in the secondary market.
The Corporation and its subsidiaries are headquartered in Fairfax County, Virginia and primarily focus on serving the greater Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area.
Our Strategy – Historical and Prospective
Our view of the financial services marketplace is that community banks must be effective in select market niches that are underserved and should stay clear of competing with large national competitors on a head-to-head basis for broad based consumer business. We started by organizing a de novo national bank in 1999. The focus of the Bank was and is serving the small and medium sized businesses and their associated professionals in the greater Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area. We find that large national competitors are ineffective at addressing this market; it is difficult to distinguish where a business’s financial needs stop and the personal financial needs of that business’s professional’s start. We believe that emerging businesses and the finances of their owners are best served hand-in-hand.
Our core competency is judgmental discipline of commercial lending based upon our personnel and practices that help our clients strategize and grow their businesses from a financial perspective. As financial success takes hold in the business, personal goals and wealth objectives of the business owners become increasingly important. Our second competency is a derivative of the first. We have the personnel, skills and strategy, and know how to provide private banking services that assist our individual clients to acquire assets, build wealth, and manage their resources. Mortgage banking and the related activities in our model go hand-in-hand with supplying effective private banking services. Unlike most banking companies, the heart of our Mortgage Division is ingrained into our commercial bank, serving the same clients side-by-side in a coordinated and seamless fashion. We believe that lending is not enough in today’s environment to attract and retain commercial and professional clients. The credit services must be backed up by competitive deposit and cash management products and operational excellence. We have made significant investments in skilled personnel and the latest technology to ensure we can deliver these services.
We generally expect to have fewer branch locations compared to similar size banking companies. We do not view our branch network as a significant determinant of our growth. Our marketing strategies focus on benefits other than branch location convenience. 
The goal was and is to generate at least 80% of the Corporation’s net income from the core business of the Bank, with the rest of our consolidated net income to be generated from related fee income activities. We will consider entering other related fee income businesses that serve our target market as opportunities, market conditions, and our capacity dictate. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on segment performance. 
5

We expect to grow our Bank by continuing to hire and train our own skilled personnel. We provide a sound infrastructure that facilitates the success of businesses, their owners and key personnel, not only today but tomorrow and on into the ensuing decades. Growth by acquisition will be considered carefully as was done with the merger with Middleburg.
Merger with Middleburg Financial Corporation
On April 1, 2017, the Corporation completed its merger with Middleburg, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Middleburg Bank and Middleburg Investment Group, Inc. The merger was effected pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of October 21, 2016, between Access and Middleburg, and a related Plan of Merger (together, the "Merger Agreement"). At December 31, 2016, Middleburg had total assets of $1.27 billion, gross loans of $860.1 million, and total deposits of $1.05 billion. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, holders of shares of Middleburg common stock had a right to receive 1.3314 shares of the Corporation’s common stock for each share of Middleburg common stock held immediately prior to the effective date of the merger, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. Each option to purchase shares of Middleburg common stock granted under a Middleburg equity-based compensation plan that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger was cancelled for a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the difference between the closing sale price of Middleburg common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the effective date of the merger and the per share exercise price of the stock option, and (ii) the number of shares of Middleburg common stock subject to such stock option. Each restricted share of Middleburg common stock granted under a Middleburg equity compensation plan that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger was, pursuant to the terms of each such grant, vested in full immediately prior to the effective date of the merger and converted into unrestricted shares of the Corporation’s common stock based on the exchange ratio. Each share of the Corporation's common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger remained outstanding and was unaffected by the Merger.
Shortly after the effective time of the merger, Middleburg Bank, Middleburg’s wholly-owned bank subsidiary, merged with and into Access Bank with Access Bank surviving. Data/office integrations were completed on schedule as of August 4, 2017.
This description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which was included as Exhibit 2.1 to the Form 8-K filed October 25, 2016 and incorporated by reference herein.
Lending Activities
The Bank’s lending activities involve commercial real estate loans both owner occupied and non-owner occupied, residential real estate loans, commercial loans, commercial and real estate construction loans, home equity loans, and consumer loans. These lending activities provide access to credit to small and medium sized businesses, professionals, and consumers in the greater Washington, D.C. Metropolitan and Richmond areas. Loans originated by the Bank are classified as loans held for investment. The Mortgage Division originates residential mortgages and home equity loans that are held on average fifteen to forty-five days pending their sale primarily to mortgage banking subsidiaries of large financial institutions. The Bank is also approved to sell loans directly to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and is able to securitize loans that are insured by the Federal Housing Administration. In the past, when the Mortgage Division was a separate subsidiary of the Bank, the Bank would, in certain circumstances, purchase adjustable rate mortgage loans in the Bank’s market area directly from the Mortgage Corporation to supplement loan growth in the Bank’s portfolio. The Bank did not purchase any loans originated by the Mortgage Division for said purpose in 2017 but may retain additional loans in the future if management believes doing so would assist in achieving the Corporation’s strategic goals. Loans held in the Bank’s portfolio at December 31, 2017 resulting from the Mortgage Division’s inability to sell the loan to a third party totaled $3.58 million. Each of our principal loan types are described below.
At December 31, 2017 loans held for investment totaled $1.98 billion compared to $1.05 billion at year end 2016. The Bank experienced growth in all loan categories reflecting continued improvement in local economic conditions.
The Bank’s lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by federal law. While differing limits apply in certain circumstances based on the type of loan, in general, the Bank’s lending limit to any one borrower is equal to 15% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. The Bank has established relationships with correspondent banks to participate in loans when loan amounts exceed the Bank’s legal lending limits or internal lending policies. The Bank’s primary regulator will allow lending relationships to any one borrower to exceed the 15% threshold if the amount greater than 15% is fully secured by cash or readily marketable securities. At December 31, 2017 unsecured loans were comprised of $107.1 million in commercial loans of which $94.0 million of these loans pertained to SBA guaranteed loans and approximately $3.6 million in consumer loans and collectively equal approximately 5.59% of the loans held for investment portfolio.
6

We have an established credit policy that includes procedures for underwriting each type of loan and lending personnel have been assigned specific authorities based upon their experience. Loans in excess of an individual loan officer’s authority are presented to our Loan Committee for approval. The Loan Committee meets weekly to facilitate a timely approval process for our clients. Loans are approved based on the borrower’s capacity for credit, collateral and sources of repayment. Loans are actively monitored to detect any potential performance issues. We manage our loans within the context of a risk grading system developed by management based upon extensive experience in administering loan portfolios in our market. Payment performance is carefully monitored for all loans. When loan repayment is dependent upon an operating business or investment real estate, periodic financial reports, site visits, and select asset verification procedures are used to ensure that we accurately rate the relative risk of our assets. Based upon criteria that are established by management and the Board of Directors, the degree of monitoring is escalated or relaxed for any given borrower based upon our assessment of the future repayment risk.
The Bank does not currently hold any pay option adjustable rate mortgages, loans with teaser rates, subprime loans, Alt A loans or any other loans considered to be “high-risk loans” in its loans held for investment portfolio, and did not during 2017, 2016, or 2015. The Mortgage Division does not currently originate any subprime loans or Alt A loans, did not originate such loans in 2017, 2016, or 2015, and does not expect to offer these programs in the future.
Loan Portfolio – Loans Held for Investment.  The following outlines the composition of loans held for investment. 
Commercial Real Estate Loans-Owner Occupied: Loans in this category represent 23.60% of our loan portfolio held for investment, as of December 31, 2017. This category represents loans supporting an owner occupied commercial property. Repayment is dependent upon the cash flows generated by operation of the commercial property. Loans are secured by the subject property and underwritten to policy standards. Policy standards approved by the Board of Directors from time to time set forth, among other considerations, loan to value limits, cash flow coverage ratios, and the general creditworthiness of the obligors.
Commercial Real Estate Loans-Non-Owner Occupied: Also known as Commercial Real Estate Loans-Income Producing. Loans in this category represent 22.04% of our loan portfolio held for investment, as of December 31, 2017. This category includes loans secured by commercial property that is leased to third parties and loans to non-profit organizations such as churches and schools. Also included in this category are loans secured by farmland and multifamily properties. Repayment is dependent upon the cash flows generated from rents or by the non-profit organization. Loans are secured by the subject property and underwritten to policy standards. Policy standards approved by the Board of Directors from time to time set forth, among other considerations, loan to value limits, cash flow coverage ratios, and the general creditworthiness of the obligors.
Residential Real Estate Loans: This category includes loans secured by first or second mortgages on one to four family residential properties, generally extended to existing consumers of other Bank products, and represents 24.74% of the loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2017. Of this amount, the following sub-categories exist as a percentage of the whole Residential Real Estate Loan portfolio: Home Equity Lines of Credit 16.4%; First Trust Mortgage Loans 79.2%; Loans Secured by a Junior Trust 4.4%.
Home Equity Loans are extended to borrowers in our target market. Real estate equity is the largest component of consumer wealth in our marketplace. Once approved, this consumer finance tool allows the borrowers to access the equity in their home or investment property and use the proceeds for virtually any purpose. Home Equity Loans are most frequently secured by a second lien on residential property. One to Four Family Residential First Trust Loan, or First Trust Mortgage Loan, proceeds are used to acquire or refinance the primary financing on owner occupied and residential investment properties. Junior Trust Loans, or Loans Secured by Second Trust Loans, are to consumers wherein the proceeds have been used for a stated consumer purpose. Examples of consumer purposes are education, refinancing debt, or purchasing consumer goods. The loans are generally extended in a single disbursement and repaid over a specified period of time.
Loans in the Residential Real Estate portfolio are underwritten to standards within a traditional consumer framework that is periodically reviewed and updated by our management and Board of Directors and includes analysis of: repayment source and capacity, value of the underlying property, credit history, savings pattern, and stability.
Commercial Loans: Commercial Loans represent 23.43% of our loan portfolio held for investment as of December 31, 2017. These loans are to businesses or individuals within our target market for business purposes. Typically the loan proceeds are used to support working capital and the acquisition of fixed assets of an operating business. These loans are underwritten based upon our assessment of the obligor’s(s’) ability to generate operating cash flow in the future necessary to repay the loan. To address the risks associated with the uncertainties of future cash flow, these loans are generally well secured by assets owned by the business or its principal shareholders and the principal shareholders are typically required to guarantee the loan.
7

Real Estate Construction Loans: Real Estate Construction Loans, also known as construction and land development loans, comprise 4.93% of our held for investment loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017. These loans generally fall into one of four circumstances: loans to construct owner occupied commercial buildings, loans to individuals that are ultimately used to acquire property and construct an owner occupied residence, loans to builders for the purpose of acquiring property and constructing homes for sale to consumers, and loans to developers for the purpose of acquiring land that is developed into finished lots for the ultimate construction of residential or commercial buildings. Loans of these types are generally secured by the subject property within limits established by the Board of Directors based upon an assessment of market conditions and up-dated from time to time. The loans typically carry recourse to principal borrowers. In addition to the repayment risk associated with loans to individuals and businesses, loans in this category carry construction completion risk. To address this additional risk, loans of this type are subject to additional administrative procedures designed to verify and ensure progress of the project in accordance with allocated funding, project specifications, and time frames.
Consumer Loans: Consumer Loans make up approximately 1.26% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017. Most loans are well secured with assets other than real estate, such as marketable securities or automobiles. Very few loans are unsecured. As a matter of operation, management discourages unsecured lending. Loans in this category are underwritten to standards within a traditional consumer framework that is periodically reviewed and updated by our management and Board of Directors: repayment source and capacity, collateral value, credit history, savings pattern, and stability.
Loans Held for Sale (“LHFS”). Loans in this category are originated by the Mortgage Division and comprised of residential mortgage loans extended to consumers and underwritten in accordance with standards set forth by an institutional investor to whom we expect to sell the loan. Loan proceeds are used for the purchase or refinance of the property securing the loan. Loans and servicing are sold concurrently. The LHFS loans are closed in our name and carried on our books until the loan is delivered to and purchased by an investor, generally within fifteen to forty-five days. In 2017, we originated $433 million of loans processed in this manner, down from $545 million in 2016. At December 31, 2017 loans held for sale totaled $32.0 million compared to $35.7 million at year end 2016. The amount of loans held for sale outstanding at the end of any given month fluctuates with the volume of loans closed during the month and the timing of loans purchased by investors.
Deposits
Deposits are the primary source of funding loan growth. At December 31, 2017 deposits totaled $2.23 billion compared to $1.05 billion at December 31, 2016.
Market Area
The Corporation, the Bank, the Mortgage Division, and ACM are headquartered in Fairfax County and primarily serve the Northern Virginia region and the Greater Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area while Middleburg Trust Company is headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and services the Richmond and Northern Virginia regions. We believe that the economic conditions in Fairfax County provide a reasonable proxy for economic conditions across our primary market, the greater Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area. Fairfax County is a diverse and thriving urban county. The most recent census figures reported by the U.S. Census Bureau show the county at 1,148,433 making it the most populous jurisdiction in the Commonwealth of Virginia, with about 13.5% of Virginia's population. The proximity to Washington, D.C. and the influence of the federal government and its spending provides somewhat of a recession shelter for the area. The Fairfax County government provides the following information about current economic conditions and trends in Fairfax County.
During 2017, the average home sales price in Fairfax County was $568 thousand compared to $544 thousand in 2016, an increase of 4.3%. Home sales volume increased 4% for Fairfax County when comparing 2016 figures to 2017. Home sale values in the Washington D.C. area rose 2.8% during 2017 when compared to the same period as reported by Standard & Poor’s Case-Shiller Home Price Indices.
The Federal Reserve Board’s Fifth District – Richmond March 2018 snapshot report stated Virginia’s economic figures were somewhat positive in recent months as the unemployment rate held steady and the housing market generally expanded despite payroll employment falling slightly. Overall vacancy rates in Northern Virginia improved by 10 basis points in 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016 but still remained above the10-year annual average of 13.5%.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Bank had approximately $436.1 million and $184.7 million, respectively, in non-owner occupied income producing commercial real estate loans. The properties securing these loans are generally small office buildings and industrial properties located in our trade area with less than ten tenants. Income producing property loans are underwritten with personal and business guarantees that provide secondary sources of repayment and mitigate market risk factors.
8

The unemployment rate for Fairfax County was 2.6% in December 2017 compared to 3.3% for the state of Virginia and 4.1% for the nation. Median household income in Fairfax County was $114,329 compared to Virginia at $66,149.
Competition
The Bank competes with virtually all banks and financial institutions which offer services in its market area. Much of this competition comes from large financial institutions headquartered outside the state of Virginia, each of which has greater financial and other resources to conduct large advertising campaigns and offer incentives. To attract business in this competitive environment, the Bank relies on personal contact by its officers and directors, local promotional activities, and the ability to provide personalized custom services to small and medium sized businesses and professionals. In addition to providing full service banking, the Bank offers and promotes alternative and modern conveniences such as internet banking, automated clearinghouse transactions, remote deposit capture, and courier services for commercial clients. Because federal regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative debate, we cannot foresee how federal regulation of financial institutions may change in the future. However, it is possible that current and future governmental regulatory and economic initiatives could impact the competitive landscape in the Bank’s markets.
Employees
At December 31, 2017 the Corporation had 415 employees, 270 of whom were employed by the Bank (excluding the Mortgage Division), 115 of whom were employed by the Mortgage Division, and 34 of whom were employed by the Wealth Management subsidiaries. None of the employees of the Corporation are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Management considers employee relations to be good.
Supervision and Regulation
Set forth below is a brief description of the material laws and regulations that affect the Corporation. The description of these statutes and regulations is only a summary and is not a complete discussion or analysis. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations summarized below. No assurance can be given that these statutes or regulations will not change in the future.
General. The financial crisis of 2008, the threat of collapse of numerous financial institutions, and other recent events led to the adoption of numerous new laws and regulations that apply to and focus on financial institutions. The most significant of these laws is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”) which was adopted on July 21, 2010 and, in part, was intended to implement significant structural reforms to the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act is discussed in more detail below.
The Corporation continues to experience an environment of constant regulatory reform. These regulatory changes could have a significant impact on how the Corporation conducts its business. The specific implications of these new laws and regulations cannot yet be fully predicted and will depend to a large extent on the specific regulations that are adopted in the future.
As a national bank, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision, and regular examination by the Comptroller. The prior approval of the Comptroller or other appropriate bank regulatory authority is required for a national bank to merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant’s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) and fair housing initiatives, and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. Each depositor’s account with the Bank is insured by the FDIC to the maximum amount permitted by law. The Bank is also subject to certain regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board and applicable provisions of Virginia law, insofar as they do not conflict with or are not preempted by federal banking law.
The regulations of the FDIC, the Comptroller, and Federal Reserve Board govern most aspects of the Corporation’s banking business, including deposit reserve requirements, investments, loans, certain check clearing activities, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, branching, deposit interest rate ceilings, and numerous other matters. The Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller and the FDIC have adopted guidelines and released interpretative materials that establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safe and sound operation of banks and bank holding companies. These standards relate to the institution’s key operating functions, including but not limited to capital management, internal controls, internal audit system, information systems and cybersecurity, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure and risk

management, vendor management, executive management and its compensation, corporate governance, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, liquidity and risk management.
As a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in the United States, the Corporation’s business is particularly susceptible to changes in state and federal legislation and regulations, which may have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting permissible activities or increasing competition.
The Bank Holding Company Act. The Corporation is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, and is registered as such with, and subject to the supervision of, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. A bank holding company is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before making certain acquisitions or engaging in certain activities. Bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions on transactions with insiders and affiliates.
Generally, a bank holding company is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, and before it may acquire ownership or control of the voting shares of any bank if, after giving effect to the acquisition, the bank holding company would own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank. The Federal Reserve Board’s approval is also required for the merger or consolidation of bank holding companies.
The Corporation is required to file periodic reports with the Federal Reserve Board and provide any additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require. The Federal Reserve Board also has the authority to examine the Corporation and the Bank, as well as any arrangements between the Corporation and the Bank, with the cost of any such examinations to be borne by the Corporation. The Federal Reserve Board has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve Board has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or ownership constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.
Banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law in dealings with their holding companies and other affiliates.
The Dodd-Frank Act.    The Dodd-Frank Act implemented far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including changes that have affected all bank holding companies and banks, including the Corporation and the Bank. Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that significantly affect the business of the Corporation and the Bank include the following:

• | Creation of a new agency, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), that has rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and have broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws.


• | Changes in standards for Federal preemption of state laws related to federally chartered institutions, such as the Bank, and their subsidiaries.


• | Permanent increase of deposit insurance coverage to $250 thousand and permission for depository institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts.


• | Changes in the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital, eliminates the ceiling on the size of the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF’), and increases the floor of the size of the DIF.


• | Prohibition on banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (the “Volker Rule”).


• | Requires loan originators to retain 5 percent of any loan sold or securitized, unless it is a “qualified residential mortgage”, subject to certain exceptions.

In 2017, both the House of Representatives and the Senate introduced legislation that would repeal or modify provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and significantly impact financial services regulation. Although the bills vary in content, certain key aspects include revisions to rules related to mortgage loans, delayed implementation of rules related to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, reform and simplification of certain Volcker Rule requirements, and raising the threshold for applying enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50 billion to those with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $250 billion. Some of the rules that have been proposed and, in some cases, adopted to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act’s mandates are discussed further below.

Dividends. There are both federal and state regulatory restrictions on dividend payments by both the Bank and the Corporation that may affect the Corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock. As a bank holding company, the Corporation is a separate legal entity from the Bank. Virtually all of the Corporation’s income results from dividends paid to the Corporation by the Bank. The amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank depends upon the Bank’s net income and capital position and is limited by federal and state law, regulations, and policies. In addition to specific regulations governing the permissibility of dividends, the Federal Reserve Board and the Comptroller are generally authorized to prohibit payment of dividends if they determine that the payment of dividends by the Corporation or the Bank, respectively, would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The Corporation began paying dividends in February 2006 and, as of March 30, 2018, meets all regulatory requirements to continue doing so. The Corporation declared and paid dividends totaling $9.36 million in 2017 discussed in more detail under “Item 5 - Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities”.
Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller and the FDIC have adopted rules to implement the Basel III capital framework as outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and standards for calculating risk-weighted assets and risk-based capital measurements (collectively, the “Basel III Final Rules”) that apply to banking organizations they supervise. For the purposes of these capital rules, (i) common equity tier 1 capital (“CET1”) consists principally of common stock (including surplus) and retained earnings; (ii) Tier 1 capital consists principally of CET1 plus non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, and certain grandfathered cumulative preferred stocks and trust preferred securities; and (iii) Tier 2 capital consists principally of Tier 1 capital plus qualifying subordinated debt and preferred stock, and limited amounts of the allowance for loan losses. Each regulatory capital classification is subject to certain adjustments and limitations, as implemented by the Basel III Final Rules. The Basel III Final Rules also establish risk weightings that are applied to many classes of assets held by community banks, importantly including applying higher risk weightings to certain commercial real estate loans.
The Basel III Final Rules were effective on January 1, 2015, and the Basel III Final Rules capital conservation buffer (as described below) is being phased in from 2016 to 2019.
When fully phased in, the Basel III Final Rules require banks to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets (the “CET1 Capital Ratio”) of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (the “Tier 1 Capital Ratio”) of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets (the “Total Capital Ratio”) of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio (the “Leverage Ratio”) of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter).
The Basel III Final Rules provide deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital measures, and primarily to CET1, including deductions and adjustments that were not applied to reduce CET1 under historical regulatory capital rules. For example, mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities must be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. These deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital are generally being phased in beginning in 2015 through 2018. The Basel III Final Rules permanently includes in Tier 1 capital trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital.
The Basel III Final Rules also implement a “countercyclical capital buffer,” generally designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk. This buffer is a CET1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% when fully implemented (potentially resulting in total buffers of between 2.5% and 5%).
Prompt Corrective Action. The federal banking agencies have broad powers to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depositary institutions. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), there are five capital categories applicable to insured institutions, each with specific regulatory consequences. The extent of the agencies’ powers depends on whether the institution in question is “well capitalized”, “adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized”, or “critically undercapitalized”, as such terms are defined under uniform regulations issued by each of the federal banking agencies. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an insured 
11

institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition, it may reclassify the institution to a lower capital category (other than critically undercapitalized) and require the submission of a plan to correct the unsafe or unsound condition.
Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a financial institution could subject the Corporation and the Bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits and other restrictions on its business. In addition, an institution cannot make a capital distribution, such as a dividend or other distribution that is in substance a distribution of capital to the owners of the institution if following such a distribution the institution would be undercapitalized. Thus, if payment of such a distribution would cause the Bank to become undercapitalized, it could not pay a dividend to the Corporation.
Deposit Insurance. The Bank’s deposits are insured by the DIF of the FDIC up to the standard maximum insurance amount for each deposit insurance ownership category. The basic limit on FDIC deposit insurance coverage is $250,000 per depositor. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC, subject to administrative and potential judicial hearing and review processes.
The DIF is funded by assessments on banks and other depository institutions calculated based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital). As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted a large-bank pricing assessment scheme, set a target “designated reserve ratio” (described in more detail below) of 2 percent for the DIF and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower assessment rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2 percent and 2.5 percent. An institution’s assessment rate is based on a statistical analysis of financial ratios that estimates the likelihood of failure over a three year period, which considers the institution’s weighted average CAMELS component rating, and is subject to further adjustments including related to levels of unsecured debt and brokered deposits (not applicable to banks with less than $10 billion in assets). At December 31, 2017, total base assessment rates for institutions that have been insured for at least five years range from 1.5 to 40 basis points, with rates of 1.5 to 30 basis points applying to banks with less than $10 billion in assets.
The Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the FDIC increased discretion with regard to managing the required amount of reserves for the DIF, or the “designated reserve ratio.” Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act (i) raised the minimum designated reserve ratio to 1.35 percent and removed the upper limit on the designated reserve ratio, (ii) requires that the reserve ratio reach 1.35 percent by September 2020, and (iii) requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion of raising the reserve ratio from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent – which requirement was met by rules adopted by the FDIC during 2016. On June 30, 2016 the designated reserve ratio rose to 1.17 percent, which triggered three major changes to deposit insurance assessment rates beginning for the third quarter of 2016: (i) the range of initial assessment rates for all institutions declined from 5 to 35 basis points to 3 to 30 basis points (which are included in the total base assessment rates in the above paragraph); (ii) surcharges equal to an annual rate of 4.5 basis points began for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more; and (iii) the revised assessment method described above was implemented. The FDIA requires that the FDIC consider the appropriate level for the designated reserve ratio on at least an annual basis. At June 30, 2017, the reserve ratio was 1.24 percent. The FDIC has adopted a new DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35 percent by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act.
Confidentiality and Required Disclosures of Financial Information. The Corporation is subject to various laws and regulations that address the privacy of nonpublic personal financial information of consumers. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other regulations issued thereunder protect against the transfer and use by financial institutions of consumer nonpublic personal information. A financial institution must provide to its customers, at the beginning of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution’s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers’ nonpublic personal financial information. These privacy provisions generally prohibit a financial institution from providing a customer’s personal financial information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that the information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. In 2016, the CFPB proposed rules that provide an exception to the requirement to deliver an annual privacy notice if a financial institution only provides nonpublic personal information to unaffiliated third parties under limited exceptions under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related regulations, and has not changed its policies and practices regarding disclosure of nonpublic personal financial information from those disclosed in the most recent privacy notice provided to the customer. The comment period for these proposed rules has closed, and a final rule has not been published.
The Corporation is subject to various laws and regulations that attempt to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bank Secrecy Act requires all financial institutions to, among other things, create a system of controls designed to prevent money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and imposes recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The USA Patriot Act 
12

provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering. Certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act impose the obligation to establish anti-money laundering programs. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) has sent, and will send, our banking regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. The Bank has been requested, and will be requested, to search its records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists. If the Bank finds any relationships or transactions, it must file a suspicious activity report and contact the FBI. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), which is a division of the U.S. Treasury, is responsible for helping to insure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with “enemies” of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC has sent, and will send, our banking regulatory agencies lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, and publicly releases information on designations of persons and organizations suspected of engaging in these activities. If the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze such account or place transferred funds in a blocked account, file a suspicious activity report and notify the FBI.
Community Reinvestment Act.  The Bank is subject to the requirements of CRA. The CRA imposes on financial institutions an affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. A financial institution’s efforts in meeting community credit needs currently are evaluated as part of the examination process pursuant to three performance tests. These factors also are considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. In April 2015, the Bank received a “satisfactory” CRA rating.
Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Atlanta. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, which is one of twelve regional FHLBs that provide funding to their members for making housing loans as well as for affordable housing and community development lending. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. As a member the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB in an amount equal to 4.25% of aggregate outstanding advances and letters of credit in addition to the membership stock requirement of 0.09% of the Bank’s total assets.
Consumer Protection. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a federal regulatory agency that is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws for institutions with more than $10 billion of assets and, to a lesser extent, smaller institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to supervise and regulate providers of consumer financial products and services, and establishes the CFPB’s power to act against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices, and gives the CFPB rulemaking authority in connection with numerous federal consumer financial protection laws (for example, but not limited to, the Truth-in-Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act).
As a smaller institution (i.e., with assets of $10 billion or less), most consumer protection aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be applied to the Corporation by the Federal Reserve Board and to the Bank by the Comptroller. However, the CFPB may include its own examiners in regulatory examinations by a small institution’s prudential regulators and may require smaller institutions to comply with certain CFPB reporting requirements. In addition, regulatory positions taken by the CFPB and administrative and legal precedents established by CFPB enforcement activities, including in connection with supervision of larger bank holding companies, could influence how the Federal Reserve Board and Comptroller apply consumer protection laws and regulations to financial institutions that are not directly supervised by the CFPB. The precise effect of the CFPB’s consumer protection activities on the Corporation and the Bank cannot be determined with certainty.
Mortgage Banking Regulation. The Mortgage Division is subject to the rules and regulations of, and examination by, HUD, the Federal Housing Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and state regulatory authorities with respect to originating, processing, and selling mortgage loans. Those rules and regulations, among other things, establish standards for loan origination, prohibit discrimination, provide for inspections and appraisals of property, require credit reports on prospective borrowers, and, in some cases, restrict certain loan features and fix maximum interest rates and fees. In addition to other federal laws, mortgage origination activities are subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth-in-Lending Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and Home Ownership Equity Protection Act, and the regulations promulgated there under. These laws prohibit discrimination, require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit and settlement costs, limit payment for settlement services to the reasonable value of the services rendered, and require the maintenance and disclosure of information regarding the disposition of mortgage applications based on race, gender, geographical distribution, and income level.
The Mortgage Division’s mortgage origination activities are also subject to Regulation Z, which implements the Truth-in-Lending Act. Certain provisions of Regulation Z require mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination, 
13

based on verified and documented information, that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Alternatively, a mortgage lender can originate “qualified mortgages”, which are generally defined as mortgage loans without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, terms exceeding 30 years, and points and fees paid by a consumer equal to or less than 3% of the total loan amount. Higher-priced qualified mortgages (e.g., subprime loans) receive a rebuttable presumption of compliance with ability-to-repay rules, and other qualified mortgages (e.g., prime loans) are deemed to comply with the ability-to-repay rules. The Mortgage Division predominately originates mortgage loans that comply with Regulation Z’s “qualified mortgage” rules.
Consumer Laws and Regulations. The Bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Fair Housing Act, among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions transact business with customers. The Bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations.
Incentive Compensation. The Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller and the FDIC issued regulatory guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking.
The Federal Reserve Board will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Corporation, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” The findings will be included in reports of examination and deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization's supervisory ratings. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization's safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
In 2016, the SEC and the federal banking agencies proposed rules that prohibit covered financial institutions (including bank holding companies and banks) from establishing or maintaining incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing covered persons (consisting of senior executive officers and significant risk takers, as defined in the rules) with excessive compensation, fees or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the financial institution. The proposed rules outline factors to be considered when analyzing whether compensation is excessive and whether an incentive-based compensation arrangement encourages inappropriate risks that could lead to material loss to the covered financial institution, and establishes minimum requirements that incentive-based compensation arrangements must meet to be considered to not encourage inappropriate risks and to appropriately balance risk and reward. The proposed rules also impose additional corporate governance requirements on the boards of directors of covered financial institutions and impose additional record-keeping requirements. The comment period for these proposed rules has closed and a final rule has not yet been published.
Stress Testing. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking agencies have implemented stress testing requirements for certain financial institutions, including bank holding companies and state chartered banks, with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. Although these requirements do not apply to institutions with $10 billion or less in total consolidated assets, the federal banking agencies, including the Comptroller, emphasize that all banking organizations, regardless of size, should have the capacity to analyze the potential impact of adverse market conditions or outcomes on the organization’s financial condition. Based on existing regulatory guidance, the Corporation and the Bank will be expected to consider the institution’s interest rate risk management, commercial real estate concentrations and other credit-related information, and funding and liquidity management during this analysis of adverse market conditions or outcomes.
Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances, and places limits on ownership of equity investments in private equity and hedge funds (the “Volcker Rule”). The Corporation believes that its financial condition and its operations are not and will not be significantly affected by the Volcker Rule or its implementing regulations.
Cybersecurity. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of a financial institution’s board of directors. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial products and services. The federal banking agencies expect financial institutions to establish lines of defense and ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, and also expect financial institutions to maintain sufficient business continuity planning 
14

processes to ensure rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack. If the Corporation or the Bank fails to meet the expectations set forth in this regulatory guidance, the Corporation or the Bank could be subject to various regulatory actions and any remediation efforts may require significant resources of the Corporation or the Bank.
In October 2016, the federal banking agencies issued proposed rules on enhanced cybersecurity risk-management and resilience standards that would apply to very large financial institutions and to services provided by third parties to these institutions. The comment period for these proposed rules has closed and a final rule has not been published. Although the proposed rules would apply only to bank holding companies and banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, these rules could influence the federal banking agencies’ expectations and supervisory requirements for information security standards and cybersecurity programs of smaller financial institutions, such as the Corporation and the Bank.
Middleburg Trust Company.  Middleburg Trust Company is subject to supervision and regulation by the Virginia State Corporation Commission’s Bureau of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve Board.
State and federal regulators have substantial discretion and latitude in the exercise of their supervisory and regulatory authority over Middleburg Trust Company, including the statutory authority to promulgate regulations affecting the conduct of its business and operations of Middleburg Trust Company. They also have the ability to exercise substantial remedial powers with respect to Middleburg Trust Company in the event that it determines that Middleburg Trust Company is not in compliance with applicable laws, orders or regulations governing its operations, is operating in an unsafe or unsound manner, or is engaging in any irregular practices.
Tax Reform. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Reform Act"). The legislation made key changes to the U.S. tax law, including the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Reform Act, the Corporation revalued its ending net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 and recognized a provisional $3.5 million tax expense in the Corporation’s consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017. We are still analyzing certain aspects of the new law and refining our calculations, which could affect the measurement of these assets and liabilities or give rise to new deferred tax amounts. The accounting is expected to be complete when the 2017 U.S. corporate income tax return is filed in 2018.
A “publicly held corporation,” such as the Corporation, is not permitted to deduct compensation in excess of $1 million per year paid to certain employees. The Tax Reform Act eliminates certain exceptions to the $1 million limit applicable under prior law related to performance-based compensation, such as equity grants and cash bonuses that are paid only on the attainment of performance goals. As a result, our ability to deduct certain compensation paid to our most highly compensated employees will now be limited.
