Launch of CrossLayer 
 
On October 26, 2017, FTE announced the launch of CrossLayer, a managed network services company with technology that introduces a new business model for connected large-scale, state-of-the-art campuses and multi-use developments. This new business base, added to FTE’s existing portfolio, leverages infrastructure and construction management expertise across a larger addressable market for expanded customer offerings and attendant growth opportunities.
 
Technology Services
 
CrossLayer’s purpose-built platform is designed to enable commercial real estate property owners and businesses to introduce and deliver innovative services quicker, while creating monetization opportunities previously available only to network operators. By providing reduced capital and operating costs for customers, CrossLayer’s managed network service solutions deliver the agility and flexibility to meet evolving technology advancements.
 
CrossLayer’s service platform is distinct from those of its competitors for the following reasons:
 

● | Single network to reduce complexity and increase efficiency; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Revenue sharing model to increase building net operating income; 
● | Service availability; 
● | Direct connect to the internet eliminates need for ISP or cable provider; 
● | Single contact for service and support; and 
● | Specific focus on enabling building management systems 

Infrastructure Services 
 
Benchmark, our construction management subsidiary provides general contracting and construction management services on interior commercial space, predominately in the New York City market. New York City construction industry spending is expected to maintain a record $50 billion annual pace through 2019, an increase of 30% from 2015 levels. The general contracting and construction management industry in given geographic markets is typically very competitive at the local level and services by providers with a local presence where there is a familiarity with the client base, understanding of local laws and regulations, and relationships with the subcontractor trades as well as other professionals including architects and engineers. A significant part of our collective success in this market is attributable to strong relationships with core clients, in particular Benchmark’s long-standing reputation for quality service and industry-recognized depth of experience.

While Benchmark has the potential to expand into other industry verticals such as government or healthcare, as well as other geographic markets in the future, the corporate commercial market in New York City has seen steady growth and expansion in recent years and remains on an upward growth trajectory for the foreseeable future. This growth has been fueled by a combination of factors, including the broad economic expansion and the redevelopment of specific sites within New York City, the surrounding boroughs, and adjacent urban areas in New Jersey. Furthermore, as businesses relocate, expand, contract or consolidate within the city or to areas of redevelopment, there is potential for significant renovation opportunities as building owners and occupants look to renovate existing commercial space, inclusive of amenities, infrastructure and technology required to be competitive in attracting and retaining tenants.
 
Our success in these industries and markets is the result of experienced management and leadership, customer recognition in New York City, purchasing relationships and logistics, project planning, project management disciplines, training, quality control and top down commitment to customer satisfaction.
 
FTE provides comprehensive telecommunications solutions to Fortune 100/500 and other customers in the wireline and wireless telecommunications industry. Services performed by FTE include the design, engineering, installation, repair and maintenance of fiber optic, copper and coaxial cable networks used for video, data and voice transmission. In the wireless space, FTE provides engineering, design, installation and upgrade of wireless communications networks, including infrastructure, antennas, switching systems, and backhaul links from wireless systems to voice, data and video networks. FTE also provides emergency restoration services, including the repair of telecommunications infrastructure damaged by inclement weather. We also provide premise wiring where we install, repair, and maintain the telecommunications structure within improved structures.
 
FTE’s success in these technology spaces is the result of experienced management and leadership, purchasing relationships and logistics, project planning, project management disciplines, training, quality control and top down commitment to customer satisfaction.
 
We believe that certain provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) will continue to create additional demand for our services. Specifically, the ARRA includes federal stimulus funding for the deployment of broadband services to underserved areas that lack sufficient bandwidth to adequately support economic development. We also expect many customers who received stimulus funds to continue to expand their networks even though stimulus funding may no longer be available.
 
The combination of a growing North American wireless subscriber base, greater use of wireless data for consumer and enterprise applications and services, and the development of innovative consumer wireless data products has led to a significant increase in the amount of wireless data traffic on wireless networks. As a result, the traditional backhaul infrastructure that has historically linked wireless cell sites to broader voice, data and video networks is reaching capacity. To handle current and future wireless data traffic demands and to improve wireless network quality and reliability, wireless carriers are implementing plans to replace their legacy backhaul networks based on T-1 lines and circuit switching applications with fiber optic networks, typically referred to as “fiber to the cell site” initiatives. We believe these initiatives will continue several more years before the backhaul system upgrade is completed, resulting in additional opportunities to assist our wireless customers in their fiber to the cell site initiatives.
 
We anticipate increased long-term opportunities arising from plans by a number of wireless companies to deploy and implement 5G and LTE (Long Term Evolution) and XLTE (Extended Long Term Evolution) technology and networks throughout North America. These technologies are being deployed in the United States using a new spectrum, which effectively requires an entirely new network to be built. As a result, we expect significant capital expenditures will be made over a relatively long period of time as wireless carriers build out their 5G and LTE networks and then augment and optimize their networks for reliability and network quality. We believe wireless carriers are in the very early stages of their 5G and LTE network deployment plans.
 
Fiber to the X (“FTTx”) comprises the many variants of fiber optic access infrastructure. These include fiber to the home (“FTTH”), fiber to the premise (“FTTP”), fiber to the building (“FTTB”), fiber to the node (“FTTN”), and fiber to the curb or cabinet (“FTTC”). GIA announces the release of a comprehensive global report on Fiber Optic Components market. Global market for Fiber Optic Components is projected to reach US$42 billion by the year 2017. Growth will be driven by the continuously growing demand for bandwidth and the ensuing need for fiber-based broadband, robust growth in mobile internet, and stronger FTTx related deployments.
 
Outside Plant Operations
 
Outside Plant Operations (OSP) includes all forms and methods of connecting the nation’s telecommunications infrastructure. Historically this work has been with copper and then coax. Today, it is predominately aerial and buried fiber. FTE builds outside plant for large corporate customers, government entities and private investors.
 
FTE Network Services has scaled to approximately 200+ concurrent crews in multiple geographies representing multiple customers and multiple projects. FTE Network Services’ success is based on several factors:
 

● | Staff construction experience in these markets over many years in the past provides an understanding of the challenges in most every market with respect to local regulations to diverse soil types and rock formations. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FTE has a network of seasoned Project Managers and Construction Managers that it leverages in all markets on all projects. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | FTE uses a blend of self-perform and sub-contract that maintains internal quality standards and allows the company to expand operation rapidly and likewise downsize at completion preserving company profitability.

● | FTE creates a local presence for all projects with local office and warehouse space to run and manage the project and handle materials logistics respectively. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | FTE has relationships with major national suppliers for everything from heavy equipment to custom order fiber optic cable. 
● | All contract outside plant operations are fulfilled with a combination of our fleet of aerial trucks, underground plows, directional drills, fiber placement crews, and fiber splicers. 
● | All equipment used on OSP projects is mobile, with dedicated logistics to service these projects as demands change. FTE Network Services can meet any scheduling requirement and accommodate changing demands by calling on its extensive network of strategic partners. 
● | Finally, FTE itself has a broad base of experienced operators and installers dedicated to each project, and we are committed to providing the necessary personnel and equipment to meet the demands of every engagement. 

Inside Plant Operations
 
Inside Plant Operations (ISP) are services provided to major telecommunications services providers in their switching and processing facilities. The scope of services includes the following:
 

● | Cable rack / wiring build-outs 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------
● | Infrastructure build-outs 
● | DC power installation 
● | Battery installation / maintenance 
● | Uninterrupted power source (“UPS”) installation 
● | Power distribution unit (“PDU”) installation 
● | Fiber cable splicing 
● | Structured cable installation 
● | All low-voltage cable installation 
● | Provisioning, test, turn-up of FTTP, FTTN, FTTH, FTTx. 
● | Security camera installation 
● | AC circuits & conduit builds 

 
Each major telecommunications client has their own build and quality standards. FTE trains its technicians in each specific protocol and has quality standards that it maintains on each and every project. FTE has the capability to engineer, build, turn up, test and manage every component in a client’s facility. The facilities that we work in performing ISP work are secure, highly available and mission critical to the countries telecommunications infrastructure. The client facilities that FTE works inside of touches everything from Wall Street trading floors to the video, telephone and data services used every day by the typical family and individual. This critical infrastructure connects corporate land-based services, mobile data services, on-demand video, TV and cable broadcast, internet, public networks, private networks and telephone. The quality of the work product from engineering to construction in this work is critical.

Our clients engage us with confidence as is shown by our solid, standing relationships and repeat business opportunities that have been tested and forged over time.
 
Project Estimating and Feasibility Studies
 
Our subsidiaries share an estimating department that provides all cost needs, both internal and external, as a value-added service to telecommunications clients. For extremely difficult builds, we use a “boots on the ground” approach, ready with someone to look at the project up close, typically within 24 hours. For the bid process, the following steps are followed:

● | A request for a proposal, or a request for information is received from a prospective customer: typically a data file is provided with a general route, cell tower locations, laterals, rings, etc. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Using Google Earth, we provide a solution based on aerial and underground construction options, utilizing the U.S. geological studies for ground conditions and “street view” programs to analyze the conditions. Additional services are often used, including: MS Streets & Trips, MapInfo, Bing Maps, Delorme, and a national database of GIS maps. At the same time, we reach out to vendors and suppliers to start assessing rough costs for materials and labor. 
● | We specialize in complex projects with a large geographical footprint and multiple customer drop points. This goal is met by importing the customer drop points (i.e., latitude and longitude) into whichever software program the customer has specified as the deliverable. Then, using the aforementioned methods, we identify the best installation path and verify whether the most cost-effective method of installation will be aerial, underground, or existing conduit paths. This conclusion is portrayed on the deliverable software, and the different methods of construction are clearly defined by specific colors on the reports. 
● | The project is broken into segments with independent budgets for each segment, allowing the customer to identify the fiber size based upon end-use requirements. This all flows into a master project budget, giving the customer a snapshot that will allow them to make changes to the individual segments at their discretion based upon the budgetary information provided. 
● | The nationwide network of project managers is utilized to analyze the geography of each part of the project and provide feedback on critical portions of the proposed build. 
● | This all culminates into finished proposals - ones that we believe accurately represent the ideal and most cost-effective approach to the build process. Due to the process, we have solidified in our estimating department, bringing in and training additional support staff typically takes less than 2 weeks. 

Customer Concentration
 
Our revenues earned from sale of services for the year ended December 31, 2017 include 21% and 14% from two customers. These two customers accounted for approximately 66% of our total accounts receivable at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, one customer accounted for 47% of our accounts receivable. Our revenues earned from sale of products and services for the year ended December 31, 2016 included 52%, 32% and 14% from three customers. At December 31, 2016, one customer accounted for an aggregate of 66% of our total accounts receivable. The majority of our revenues are non-recurring, project-based revenues, it is not unusual for there to be significant period-to-period shifts in customer concentrations. Generally, our customers do not have an obligation to make purchases from us and may stop ordering our products and services or may terminate existing orders or contracts at any time with little or no financial penalty. The loss of any of our significant customers, any substantial decline in sales to these customers, or any significant change in the timing or volume of purchases by our customers, could result in lower revenues and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Our current customers include, in part, multiple Fortune 500 telecommunications and technology providers and integrators. We also provide telecommunications engineering, construction, installation and maintenance services to a number of cable television multiple system operators. Premise wiring services are provided to various corporations and state and local governments. The Company’s strategy for the future includes customer and service diversification reducing the customer revenue concentration to less than 15% for any single customer.
 
Competition
 
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete with other contractors in most of the geographic markets in which we operate, and several of our competitors are large companies that have significant financial, technical and marketing resources. In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into some of the industries in which we operate and, as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor. A significant portion of our revenues is currently derived from unit price or fixed price agreements, and price is often an important factor in the award of such agreements. Accordingly, we could be underbid by our competitors in an effort by them to procure such business. Economic conditions have increased the impacts of competitive pricing in certain of the markets that we serve. We believe that customers consider other factors in choosing a service provider, including technical expertise and experience, financial and operational resources, nationwide presence, industry reputation and dependability, which we expect to benefit larger contractors such as us. In addition, competition may lessen as industry resources, such as labor supplies, approach capacity. There can be no assurance, however, that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services, or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. We also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our existing or prospective customers, including telecommunications and engineering companies, which employ personnel who perform some of the same types of services as those provided by us. Although a significant portion of these services is currently outsourced by many of our customers, there can be no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource services in the future.

Materials and Supplies
 
The materials and supplies that are necessary for the operation of our businesses are available from a variety of sources. We are not dependent on any particular supplier or group of affiliated suppliers for our equipment needs.
Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations including:
 

● | licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to contractors, electricians and engineers; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection; 
● | permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects; 
● | wage and hour regulations; 
● | regulations relating to transportation of equipment and materials, including licensing and permitting requirements; and 
● | building and electrical codes. 

 
We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our operations and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses, as well as give rise to termination or cancellation rights under our contracts or disqualify us from future bidding opportunities.
 
Safety and Risk Management
 
We are committed to ensuring that our employees perform their work safely and we regularly communicate with our employees to reinforce that commitment and instill safe work habits. We review accidents and claims for our operations, examine trends and implement changes in procedures to address safety issues. Claims arising in our business generally include workers’ compensation claims, various general liability and damage claims, and claims related to vehicle accidents, including personal injury and property damage. We insure against the risk of loss arising from our operations up to certain deductible limits in substantially all of the states in which we operate. In addition, we retain risk of loss, up to certain limits, under our employee group health plan.
 
We carefully monitor claims and actively participate with our insurers in determining claims estimates and adjustments. The estimated costs of claims are accrued as liabilities, including estimates for claims incurred but not reported. Due to fluctuations in our loss experience from year to year, insurance accruals have varied and can affect the consistency of operating margins. If we experience insurance claims in excess of our umbrella coverage limit, our business could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Seasonality
 
Our revenues are affected by seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors. Consequently, our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather. Generally, inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season, which falls during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Also, a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our fourth quarter, which decreases the number of available workdays. Additionally, our customer premise equipment installation activities for cable providers historically decrease around calendar year-end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period. As a result, we may experience reduced revenue in the first or fourth quarters of our fiscal years.
Environmental Matters
 
A significant portion of our work is performed underground. As a result, we are potentially subject to material liabilities related to encountering underground objects which may cause the release of hazardous materials or substances. Additionally, the environmental laws and regulations which relate to our business include those regarding the removal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste. These laws and regulations can impose significant fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Costs associated with the discharge of hazardous materials or substances may include clean-up costs and related damages or liabilities. These costs could be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.

Employees
 
As of April 5, 2018, we, together with our subsidiaries, employ 223 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. 47 of our employees are represented by local collective bargaining units. The number of our employees varies according to the level of our work in progress. We maintain a nucleus of technical and managerial personnel to supervise all projects and add employees as needed to complete specific projects.
Intellectual Property
 
We have trademarks, trade names and licenses that we believe are necessary for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it. We do not consider our trademarks, trade names or licenses to be material to the operation of our business. On October 31, 2017 the Company announced that it filed a provisional patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for CrossLayer technology covering the decentralized provision of internet and cloud services.
 
With respect to our acquisition strategy, FTE intends to pursue a clearly defined telecommunications niche, but may, in its discretion, pursue acquisitions outside of this niche, although this will not be our focus. We selectively pursue acquisitions when we believe doing so is operationally and financially beneficial to our existing operations, although we do not rely solely on acquisitions for growth. In particular, we may pursue those acquisitions that we believe will provide us with incremental revenue and geographic diversification while complementing our existing operations. We generally target companies for acquisition that have defensible leadership positions in their market niches, are EBITDA positive, which meet or exceed industry averages, and have proven operating histories, sound management, and certain clearly identifiable cost synergies.
