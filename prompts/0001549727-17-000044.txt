Item 1.   BUSINESS
   Our Business
   Frontera Group Inc. is a management company providing business development and market consultancy services. Our target clients are various business who are looking for assistance in the areas of marketing, sales and logistics as they expand their business operations. We specifically target these types of companies because of experience of our management in providing marketing and consulting services.   We generate revenue by providing consulting services to small and medium businesses.  We acquire customers through direct marketing and referrals.   Our current services include:   Market and Competitor Research
   Breaking into new markets is inherently risky due to the unfamiliarity of the competition and consumer demand. Our comprehensive market and competitor research allows our customers to have insight into their new target market. Our customers are better able to price their products and services competitively and position their brand effectively. Market research services include market, economic and political overview, logistics and cost environment, partnership identification, competitor research including availability of distribution channels, competitor promotional strategies and identification of specific differentiation opportunities. Market and competitor research is the first step for a client's launch into a new market. These services are billed on a project basis, with the scope determined in collaboration with the client. Research can be done as a one-off service prior to a new launch, or as an on-going project with a smaller scope to monitor competition in a particular market.  4      Marketing Strategy Development
   Essential to the success of entering a new market is an appropriate and effective marketing strategy. After establishing a budget and target market, we develop a marketing plan that can help our clients reach their potential customers. A core part of our marketing services is the design and deployment of specialized reports that capture, measure and analyze target market data to provide insights into market opportunities, value proposition, positioning and messaging development. The result is a custom Business Development plan that addresses overall marketing strategy for a launch to a new market.   Translation Services
   Launching a product in a new market often requires adaptation of packaging, corporate identity documents, and marketing materials to a new language. Our translation services ensure complete compatibility with local culture and market conditions for any corporate communication materials.   Trade show and commercial event management
   An important part of a product or service launch is effective presentation at industry and consumer trade shows. We ensure an effective presentation at trade shows by developing target market appropriate booth design and sales material, as well as helping to manage staffing and logistics. We also consult and manage other commercial events, such as marketing events, product demos, and public relations events.   Administration and On-Going Business services
   We provide services offering ongoing assistance. The scope of services depends on customer requirements. We can provide one-off consultations regarding marketing or distribution strategies, resulting in short-term engagements. For customers who require extra support, we can act as broker of record for a line of products in a specific geographic area. We customarily charge the client a flat monthly fee, with an additional commission depending on a portion of sales made in the target market.  On August 9, 2017, the Company entered into separate Operating Management Agreements with three Chinese companies including Nanjing Xingfeng Agriculture Ecology Co, Ltd., Guoyang Huadu Properties Co, Ltd., and Xingguo Red World Camellia Oil Co., Ltd.
