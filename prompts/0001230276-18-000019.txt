ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Pandora—Streaming Radio and On-Demand Music Services
Pandora is the world’s most powerful music discovery platform, offering a personalized experience for each of our listeners wherever and whenever they want to listen to music—whether through mobile devices, car speakers or connected devices in the home. Unlike traditional radio that broadcasts the same content at the same time to all of its listeners, we enable our listeners to create personalized stations and playlists, as well as search and play songs and albums on-demand. The Music Genome Project, our content programming algorithms and data collected from our listeners power our ability to predict listener music preferences, play music content suited to the tastes of each individual listener and introduce listeners to the music we think they will love. Founded by musicians, Pandora also empowers artists with valuable data and tools to help grow their audience and connect with their fans.
 Pandora is available as an ad-supported radio service, a radio subscription service called Pandora Plus and an on-demand subscription service called Pandora Premium. The majority of our listener hours occur on mobile devices, with the majority of our revenue generated from advertising on our ad-supported radio service on these devices. With billions of data points that help us understand our users' preferences, we offer both local and national advertisers the opportunity to deliver targeted messages to our listeners using a combination of audio, display and video advertisements. We also generate increasing revenue from our subscription offerings.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, we streamed 20.61 billion hours of content, and as of December 31, 2017, we had 74.7 million active users during the trailing 30-day period and 5.48 million paid subscribers. Since we first launched our ad-supported service in 2005, our listeners have created over 12 billion stations.
Pandora—Ad-Supported Radio Service
Our ad-supported service allows listeners to access our catalog of music, comedy, livestreams and podcasts through our personalized playlist generating system for free across all of our delivery platforms. Our ad-supported service is valued by lean-back listeners, as it uses the Music Genome Project to instantly generate a station that plays music we think that listener will enjoy. Over time, this service has evolved by using data science to further tailor the listener experience based on listener reactions to the content we pick. Listeners also have the ability to add variety to and rename stations, which further allows for the personalization of the service. We also offer listeners on our ad-supported service the option to gain temporary access to on-demand listening experience, which includes some features of our Pandora Premium service, in exchange for viewing a video ad. We call this experience Premium Access. 
Pandora Plus—Subscription Radio Service
Pandora Plus is an ad-free, paid subscription version of the Pandora radio service that also includes replays, additional skipping of songs, offline listening, higher quality audio on supported devices and longer timeout-free listening. This service is valued by listeners who want the ability to have limited interactive features such as controlling skips and replays. Similar to the ad-supported service, the more the listener interacts with the platform, the more we tailor the content we recommend to the listener. Premium Access is also available to Pandora Plus listeners.
Pandora Premium—On-Demand Subscription Service
Our on-demand subscription service, Pandora Premium, launched in the United States in April 2017. Pandora Premium combines the radio features of Pandora Plus with a unique, on-demand experience, providing users with the ability to search, play and collect songs and albums, build playlists on their own or with the tap of a button, listen to curated playlists and share playlists on social networks. Unique to Pandora, a listener can create partial playlists and have Pandora complete the playlist based on the user's listening activity using the Music Genome Project.
Beyond song delivery, listeners can discover more about the music they hear by reading the history of their favorite artists and viewing artist photos. Mobile listeners also have access to customized listener profiles which leverage data science to showcase a listener’s musical identity by highlighting user data such as recent favorites, top artists of all time, playlists and thumbs. Our services also incorporate social networking features. Our music feed enables a real-time, centralized stream for 
listeners to view the music that their social connections are experiencing and to provide and receive recommendations for songs, albums and artists. Listeners can also share their stations, songs, albums or playlists through social media, messaging apps and email by using our share feature.
Ticketing Service
Prior to September 1, 2017, we operated a ticketing service through our former subsidiary Ticketfly, a leading live events technology company that provides ticketing and marketing software and services for clients, which are venues and event promoters, across North America. We completed the sale of Ticketfly on September 1, 2017. Refer to Note 5 "Dispositions" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Ticketfly disposition.
Our Strategy
Drive and Retain Active Users
It is critical that we drive and retain active users. We believe that our three-tier offering, which includes our ad-supported service, Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium, provides listeners multiple ways to enjoy Pandora. Continued product development, including more focus on interactivity and voice, more effective marketing and expanded partnerships with CE providers, content platforms and others, are important elements of our efforts to drive and retain active users. Additionally, we are actively focused on offering content beyond music, such as podcasts.
Increase Monetization Opportunities
Pandora is a significant provider of digital audio advertising and we believe there is a large opportunity to expand monetization. These improvements will primarily be enabled by new technology development and are intended to yield a combination of incremental advertising capacity, optimized pricing and increased sell through. 
Focus on Execution and Efficiencies
Digital audio and music is a large and growing market, but highly competitive. It is critical that we focus on execution and efficiencies. This includes focusing resources on strategic growth areas, accelerating product development cycles and increasing marketing effectiveness as well as managing content costs where possible. 
In January 2018, we announced an organizational restructuring designed to prioritize our strategic growth initiatives and optimize overall business performance. The redesign shifts resources to focus on ad-tech and audience development efforts, while positioning the company for improved operating leverage over time. It also simplifies the organization into a flatter structure for smarter, faster execution.
Our Technologies
Pandora—Streaming Radio and On-Demand Music Services
At the heart of our service are proprietary personalization technologies, including the Music Genome Project and our radio and playlist generating algorithms. 
Music Genome Project and Playlisting Algorithms
The Music Genome Project is a database of over 1.5 million uniquely analyzed songs from over 250 thousand artists, spanning over 660 genres and sub-genres, which our team of trained musicologists has developed one song at a time by evaluating and cataloging each song's particular attributes. The Music Genome Project database is a subset of our full catalog available to be played. Once we select music to become part of the Music Genome Project, our music analysts genotype the music by examining up to 450 attributes including objectively observable metrics such as tone and tempo, as well as subjective characteristics, such as lyrics, vocal texture and emotional intensity. Over time, our service has evolved by using data science to develop playlisting algorithms that further tailor the listener experience based on individual listener and broader audience reactions to the recordings we pick. We have integrated this technology into our on-demand music service, Pandora Premium, giving listeners the ability to search and play any track or album as well as offering unique playlist features tailored to each listener's distinct preferences. Listeners have the ability to search, play and collect songs and albums, build playlists on their own or with the tap of a button and automatically generate playlists based on their listening activity and the power of our Music Genome Project. Our team of curators, music analysts and data scientists have sifted through tens of millions of tracks to help 
3

listeners quickly find what they are looking for to create their own unique playlists. We employ rigorous hiring and training standards for selecting our music analysts, who typically have four-year degrees in music theory, composition or performance, and we provide them with intensive training in the Music Genome Project's precise methodology.
Next Big Sound ("NBS")
NBS Platform. NBS is the leading provider of online music analytics and insights tracking hundreds of thousands of artists around the world. NBS was founded in 2009 and tracks social, streaming and video data in one centralized platform. Sources range from Facebook and Twitter to Wikipedia, YouTube, Vevo, Instagram and many others. The NBS platform complements Pandora's Artist Marketing Platform ("AMP") and expands the suite of data-driven products that Pandora offers music makers and content partners.
Distribution and Partnerships
Pandora—Streaming Radio and On-Demand Music Services
A key element of our strategy is to make the Pandora service available in any environment that has internet connectivity. To this end, we make the Pandora service available through a variety of distribution channels. In addition to streaming our service to computers, we have developed Pandora mobile device applications ("apps") for smartphones and mobile operating systems, such as the iPhone and Android, and for tablets, including the iPad and Android tablets. We distribute those mobile apps free to listeners via app stores.
Pandora is integrated with connected devices, including automobiles, automotive aftermarket devices and consumer electronic devices, including many voice-based devices. Currently, most automobile integrations rely on smartphones for internet connectivity, which has enabled Pandora to be available in the best-selling passenger vehicles in the United States. Some automobiles are now using embedded, built-in internet connectivity to power the Pandora experience. These native integrations allow drivers to control the service via in-dash entertainment systems. As part of this ongoing effort to extend our reach in the car, we also built support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay into our mobile applications. We expect these platforms will develop and grow significantly and help broaden our reach and provide consumers with additional flexibility for accessing Pandora in the car. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 35.2 million unique users have activated Pandora through a native integration in 27 major automobile brands and 8 automotive aftermarket manufacturers.
Additionally, Pandora is integrated with thousands of consumer electronic and voice-based devices, including Sonos, Fitbit, Roku, Google Home, Amazon Echo, Comcast Xfinity, Apple TV and Microsoft Xbox. These integrations have made it easier for listeners to personalize their music experience anywhere they listen to music.
Advertising Revenue
We derive the substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of audio, display and video advertising for delivery across our computer, mobile and other connected device platforms. We generate the majority of our revenue from mobile and other connected devices, which presents an opportunity for our current and potential advertisers to reach our audience anytime, anywhere that they enjoy music.
Our advertising products allow both local and national advertisers to target and connect with listeners based on attributes including age, gender, zip code and content preferences using multi-platform ad campaigns to target their advertising messages to listeners anytime and anywhere. In the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, advertising revenue accounted for approximately 80%, 77% and 73% of our total revenue, respectively. The year-over-year change in revenue mix is due to an increase in subscription revenue related to increased Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium subscribers.
Audio Advertising. Our audio advertising products allow custom audio messages to be delivered during content programming sessions via short ad interludes on our ad-supported service. Audio ads are available across all of our delivery platforms. On supported delivery platforms, audio ads can be accompanied by display ads to further enhance advertisers' messages. We are a significant provider of digital audio advertising in the United States. 
Display Advertising. Our display advertising products offer opportunities to maximize advertising exposure to listeners of our ad-supported service on computers and mobile platforms. The graphical interface for our services on these delivery platforms is divided between our tuner, which contains our player controls and "now playing" information, and the information space surrounding our tuner. Our display ads include industry-standard banner ads of various sizes and placements within the information space surrounding our tuner, depending on the delivery platform and listener interaction.
4

Video Advertising. Our video advertising products allow delivery of rich, branded messages to further engage listeners of our ad-supported service. We currently offer video ad products, all of which are designed to play only upon listener interaction or opt-in, ensuring that advertisers have 100% share of the listener's attention during natural breaks accepted by an engaged audience. Some video ad products operate across our mobile and computer platforms, while others operate only on our mobile platform. All are designed to ensure they are viewable while playing, using interactions with Pandora to determine when a listener is engaged with the screen. Video Plus, Pandora’s newest mobile video product, enables listeners to elect to watch a video ad in return for limited access to features available in our subscription services, while brands pay only for 15 seconds of completed video view. Another video advertising product, Sponsored Listening, offers listeners one or four hours of uninterrupted music, in exchange for the listener’s active brand interaction, such as watching a video advertisement, interacting with rich media or visiting the advertiser's landing page.
Advertising Technologies. We have developed a suite of proprietary advertising technologies including order management, advertising serving and timing, native advertising formats, targeting and reporting. Given the ongoing evolution in advertising technologies, we plan to continue to invest aggressively in our ad tech to make Pandora a more efficient advertising partner and to become more competitive with our digital peers. 
Native Advertising. Our audio, display and video advertising products can be designed and modified by us and by advertisers to tailor advertising campaigns to fit specific advertiser needs. Our advertisers can create custom "branded" stations from our music library that can be accessed by listeners of our ad-supported and subscription services, as well as engage listeners by allowing them to personalize the branded stations through listener-controlled variables. 
Audience Targeting. Our audio, display, video and native advertising products have access to a set of over 2,000 targeting segments across all of our platforms, ranging from Pandora’s unique proprietary targeting segments to second- and third-party enabled segments. Examples include Pandora’s inferred Spanish Speakers and Political Preference proprietary segments, direct customer CRM upload and Datalogix and Neustar third-party segments. Additionally, advertisers can benefit from our proprietary ad targeting capabilities, which leverage listener-submitted profile information, enabling advertisers to precisely reach sought-after consumers without needing third-party cookies.
Programmatic Advertising. We have a programmatic advertising solution that allows advertisers and agencies to purchase display advertising. We intend to continue investing in programmatic advertising solutions and are currently testing video and audio programmatic offerings. We believe this is an important element to improving monetization. 
To enhance our ability to compete with local terrestrial radio stations for advertisers’ spending, our advertising inventory is integrated into the leading radio media buying platforms, Mediaocean and STRATA, and we are continuing to enhance the ability of radio advertisers to purchase media on these platforms, which incorporate Triton measurements of our radio audience reach side-by-side with terrestrial radio metrics.
 We provide in-car advertising solutions, offering advertisers the opportunity to reach in-car audiences through audio ads running on vehicle models and aftermarket automotive devices with native Pandora automotive integrations. 
 In addition, we have invested in building a local advertising sales force in major radio markets. As of December 31, 2017, Pandora has 130 local sellers in 37 markets in the United States.
Our integration into standard radio media-buying processes and measurement, our in-car advertising solutions, our local advertising sales force and our programmatic advertising buying solution are key elements of our strategy to expand our penetration of the radio advertising market. Our success in executing this strategy is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Item 1A—"Risk Factors".
Subscription and Other Revenue
Subscription and other revenue is generated primarily through the sale of monthly or annual paid subscriptions to Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium. Subscription revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the subscription period. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, subscription and other revenue accounted for 19%, 16% and 22% of our total revenue, respectively. 
Ticketing Service Revenue
Prior to the sale of Ticketfly on September 1, 2017, ticketing service revenue was generated primarily from service and merchant processing fees generated on ticket sales through the Ticketfly platform. Ticketfly sells tickets to fans for events on behalf of clients and charges either a fee per ticket or a percentage of the total convenience charge and order processing fee for its services at the time the ticket for an event is sold. Ticketing service revenue is recorded net of the face value of the ticket at the time of the sale, as Ticketfly generally acts as the agent in these transactions. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, ticketing service revenue accounted for approximately 1%, 6% and 5% of our total revenue. As Ticketfly was acquired on October 31, 2015, and subsequently sold on September 1, 2017, the consolidated statements of operations include ticketing service revenue for the two months ended December 31, 2015, the year ended December 31, 2016 and the period ended September 1, 2017. Ticketing service revenue does not include revenue subsequent to the disposition of Ticketfly. Refer to Note 5 "Dispositions" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Ticketfly disposition. 
Content, Copyrights and Royalties
The content we stream to users of the Pandora service consists primarily of music. To stream music, we must obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, copyright owners, or their agents, for each sound recording that we stream, as well as for each underlying musical work, subject to certain exclusions. These licensing and royalty arrangements strongly impact our business operations. Refer to our discussion of these matters in Item 1A—"Risk Factors".
Sound Recordings
For sound recordings, we pay content acquisition costs based on the terms of direct license agreements with major and independent music labels and distributors for the significant majority of the sound recordings we stream on our ad-supported service, Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium. Depending on the applicable service, these license agreements generally require us to pay either a per-performance fee based on the number of sound recordings we transmit, a percentage of revenue associated with the service, or a per-subscriber minimum amount. Certain of these license agreements require minimum guarantee payments, some of which are paid in advance. Refer to Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for our policy on prepaid content acquisition costs. 
If we have not entered into a direct license agreement with the copyright owner of a particular sound recording that is streamed on our services, we stream that sound recording pursuant to the statutory license and pay the applicable rates set by the Copyright Royalty Board ("CRB") for the period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2020. The rates for non-subscription services, such as our ad-supported service, were set at $0.0017 per play and the rates for subscription services, such as Pandora Plus, were set at $0.0022, adjusted for inflation. Effective January 1, 2018, these rates were adjusted for inflation to $0.0018 per play for non-subscription services and $0.0023 per play for subscription services. Sound recordings streamed under the statutory license and paid at the CRB-set rates can only be played in radio mode on our services. These sound recordings cannot be played on-demand or offline and are not eligible for replay or additional skips. 
Musical Works
Content acquisition costs for musical works are negotiated with and paid to performing rights organizations ("PROs") such as the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ("ASCAP"), Broadcast Music, Inc. ("BMI"), SESAC, Inc. ("SESAC") and Global Music Rights ("GMR"), and directly to publishing companies. Content acquisition costs for the streaming of musical works on our ad-supported service are calculated such that each copyright holder receives its usage-based and ownership-based share of a royalty pool equal to 20% of the content acquisition costs paid by us for sound recordings on our ad-supported service. Content acquisition costs for the streaming of musical works on our subscription services are equal to the rates determined in accordance with the statutory license set forth in 17 U.S.C. §115 ("Section 115").
Rate-Setting Proceedings for Reproduction Rights under Section 115 
The rate structure for the statutory license for reproduction rights under Section 115 expired at the end of 2017. A new rate structure was set in January 2018 covering the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2022 by a three judge CRB panel, and we were one of five commercial music service operators (along with Amazon, Apple, Google and Spotify) that participated in rate-setting proceedings that determined these rates (the "Phonorecords III Proceedings"). The Nashville Songwriters Association International, the National Association of Music Publishers and George Johnson Music Publishing are also participating in the Phonorecords III Proceedings. A trial before the CRB concluded in April 2017, and the CRB rendered a decision in January 2018 ("the Initial Determination"). If the Initial Determination is adopted and affirmed, the "all-in" rate that streaming services, including Pandora, will pay to music publishers and songwriters for the mechanical rights and performance rights needed in connection with interactive streaming will increase annually between 2018 and 2022: from 11.4% of revenues or 22.0% of label payments in 2018, to 15.1% of revenues or 26.2% of label payments by 2022. Certain per-subscriber 
minimum royalty floors also apply depending on the type of service. The CRB may elect to modify the Initial Determination at the request of the participants in the Phonorecords III Proceedings, and thereafter the final CRB decision may be appealed for review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
The Phonorecords III Proceedings are important to us because our direct licenses with music publishers use the Section 115 rates. As a result, increases in the Section 115 rates increase our content acquisition costs for our subscription services, which, if such increase were substantial, could materially harm our financial condition and hinder our ability to provide interactive features in our services, or cause one or more of our subscription services to not be economically viable.
Government Regulation
As a company conducting business on the internet, we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security and data protection, among other things. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In the area of information security and data protection, the laws in several states require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of information. Likewise, all but a few states have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their information. We also may be subject to certain foreign and domestic laws, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation, regarding privacy of listener data, among other things. Our privacy policy and terms of use describe our practices concerning the use, transmission and disclosure of listener information and are posted on our website. 
Sales and Marketing
We organize our sales force into multiple geographically-based teams that are each focused on selling advertising across our computer, mobile and other connected device platforms. Teams are located in our Oakland, California headquarters and in regional and local sales offices throughout the United States. 
Our marketing team is charged with using all forms of communications to reach our business and reputational goals. Prior to our reorganization, the marketing team was organized into four groups focused on campaign planning and analytics, consumer marketing, communications and our Music Makers Group. As part of the reorganization, the marketing team will increase their focus on listeners, drive marketing effectiveness and efficiency of spend and improve collaboration with advertisers. While we have historically relied on the success of viral marketing to expand consumer awareness of our service, in recent years we have launched marketing and advertising campaigns to increase consumer awareness of our brand and expand our listener base. We anticipate that we will continue to utilize these types of campaigns in the future.
Artist Relations
Industry Relations and Artist Marketing
Industry Relations and Artist Marketing, formerly the Music Makers Group, is a team that works directly with the music industry to help drive connections with fans across all channels at Pandora. Our vision is to ensure artists can promote and market their music to fans, drive engagement with experiences from live events to original content and audio messages to fans and understand all of the benefits of these interactions via our analytics tools.
Pandora Artist Marketing Platform
Pandora AMP consists of products and programs that enable music makers to leverage data to grow an audience, track progress and connect with fans on Pandora. Since its original launch focusing on artist data and insights in 2014, AMP has evolved into a set of powerful self-serve marketing tools including Artist Audio Messaging, AMPcast and Featured Tracks. Additional features of AMP, which include a dynamic feed of an artist’s campaign, performance metrics and suggestions for new campaigns, were launched in October 2016 alongside a data integration with NBS, shifting artist insights and analytics to the NBS platform and enhancing the set of desktop and mobile marketing tools offered via AMP.
Derived from tens of billions of hours of personalized listening on Pandora, the marketing tools on AMP along with the analytics tools on NBS are available to all artists spinning on Pandora and their teams. Additionally, enterprise-level tools and marketing opportunities are available to artist and label teams who have opted into a direct deal with Pandora.
Competition
Competition for Listeners
We compete for the time and attention of our listeners with other content providers on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of experience, relevance, acceptance and perception of content quality, ease of use, price, accessibility, perceptions of ad load on our ad-supported service, brand awareness and reputation. We also compete for listeners on the basis of our presence, branding and visibility as compared with other providers that deliver content through the internet, mobile devices and consumer products. We believe that we compete favorably on these factors. For additional details on risks related to competition for listeners, please refer to Item 1A—"Risk Factors".
Many of our current and potential future competitors enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, legacy operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as greater financial, technical and other resources. We compete with many forms of digital media for the time and attention of our listeners.
We also compete for listeners with broadcast radio providers, including terrestrial radio providers. Many broadcast radio conglomerates own large numbers of radio stations or other media properties. Many terrestrial radio stations broadcast digital signals, which provide high quality audio transmission.
We also face competition for listeners and listener hours from on-demand music streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Apple Music, Google Play Music, Spotify and YouTube. These services offer consumers the ability to choose the songs and artists they want to hear and create customized playlists. With the launch of Pandora Premium in April 2017, we are now able to compete more directly against these other services. Our ability to attract and retain listeners may be dependent on the success of this service and our ability to market the service effectively. This on-demand content is accessible in automobiles and homes, using portable players, mobile phones and other wireless and consumer electronic devices. The audio entertainment marketplace continues to rapidly evolve, providing our listeners with a growing number of alternatives and new media platforms. Certain technology companies that operate music streaming businesses as an ancillary revenue stream generally enjoy an advantage in that they do not rely on their music streaming services to generate profitability. In addition, they are able to favor their own music services within the devices they sell, helping to increase their listener base from existing consumers, making their music services fast growing segments. Apple, Google and Amazon are examples of competitors of this kind. 
At a macro level, we compete for the time and attention of our listeners with providers of other forms of in-home and mobile entertainment. To the extent existing or potential listeners choose to watch cable television, stream video from on-demand services or play interactive video games on their home-entertainment system, computer or mobile phone rather than listen to the Pandora service, these content services pose an adjacent competitive threat for consumer time and mindshare.
Competition for Advertisers
We compete with traditional media products and services, and with other internet-based services, for a share of our advertising customers' overall marketing budgets. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including perceived return on investment, effectiveness and relevance of our advertising products, pricing structure, the ability to deliver large volumes or precise types of ads to targeted demographics, transactional capabilities and reporting capabilities. We believe that our ability to deliver targeted and relevant ads across a wide range of platforms allows us to compete favorably on the basis of these factors and justify a long-term profitable pricing structure. However, the market for online advertising is intensely competitive and rapidly changing, and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. 
Advertisers are allocating increasing amounts of their overall marketing budgets to online advertising, yet the market for online advertising has also become increasingly competitive. We compete for online advertisers with other internet companies, including major internet portals, search engine companies and social media sites. Large internet companies with greater brand recognition have significant numbers of direct sales personnel, more advanced programmatic advertising capabilities and substantial proprietary advertising inventory and web traffic that provide a significant competitive advantage and have a significant impact on pricing for internet advertising and web traffic. 
Terrestrial radio is a source of competition for advertising dollars. Broadcast radio providers deliver ads across a more familiar platform than the internet may be to traditional advertisers. 
Our competitors include large scale online advertising platforms such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and traditional media companies such as large television broadcasters and national print outlets. We directly compete against Cumulus, Entercom, iHeartRadio, Spotify and other companies in the traditional broadcast radio market. For additional details on risks related to competition for advertisers, please refer to Item 1A—"Risk Factors".
Seasonality
Pandora—Streaming Radio and On-Demand Music Services
Our results reflect the effects of seasonal trends in listener and advertising behavior. During the last quarter of each calendar year, and particularly during the holiday season, we expect to experience both higher advertising sales due to greater advertiser demand during the holiday season and increased usage of our service due to the popularity of holiday music. In addition, in the first quarter of each calendar year, we expect to experience lower advertising sales due to reduced advertiser demand, but sustain higher levels of usage by listeners due to increased use of media-streaming devices received as gifts during the holiday season. See the section entitled "Business Trends" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more complete description of the seasonality of our financial results.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our technologies and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, contractual restrictions, technological measures and other methods. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and business partners, and we control access to and distribution of our technology and proprietary information.
We have filed and acquired dozens of active patent applications and issued patents in the United States and other countries. We continue to pursue additional patent protection, both in the United States and abroad where appropriate and cost effective. We intend to hold these patents as part of our strategy to protect and defend Pandora in patent-related litigation. We also acquire patents and patent applications from time to time as part of other transactions.
Our registered trademarks in the United States include "Pandora," "Ampcast," "Comedy Genome Project" and the "Music Genome Project," in addition to a number of Pandora logos and other marks. "Pandora" is also registered in Australia, Canada, Chile, the European Union, India, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Switzerland, Taiwan and other countries. "Music Genome Project" is also registered in Australia, Canada, China and New Zealand. We have pending trademark applications in the United States and other countries.
We are the registrant of the internet domain names for our primary website, pandora.com, as well as others related to our current and potential future businesses. 
In addition to the forms of intellectual property listed above, we own rights to proprietary processes and trade secrets, including those underlying the Pandora service. We use contractual, policy and technological means to generally control access to, and the use and distribution of our proprietary software, trade secrets and other confidential information, both internally and externally, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners.
Customer Concentration
For each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, we had no individual customers that accounted for 10% or more of total revenue.
Information About Geographic Revenue
Information about geographic revenue is set forth in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,938 employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Corporate and Available Information
We were incorporated as a California corporation in January 2000 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in December 2010. Our principal executive offices are located at 2101 Webster Street, Suite 1650, Oakland, California 94612 and 
our telephone number is (510) 451-4100. Our website is located at www.pandora.com and our Investor Relations website is located at investor.pandora.com.
We changed our fiscal year to the calendar year ending December 31, effective beginning with the period ended December 31, 2013. As a result, the period ended December 31, 2013 was shortened from a year to an eleven-month transition period. 
     We file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any other filings required by the SEC. Such reports and other information filed by us with the SEC are available free of charge on our website at investor.pandora.com when such reports are available on the SEC's website. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.
The public may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
Investors and others should note that we use our Investor Relations website, SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. We use these channels as well as social media to communicate with the public about the Company, our services and other issues. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in the Company to review the information we post on the social media channels listed on our Investor Relations website.
