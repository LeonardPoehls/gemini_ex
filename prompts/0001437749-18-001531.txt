Item 1.     Business
Overview
 
Walker Innovation Inc., a Delaware corporation (collectively, with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or “Walker Innovation”), seeks to develop and commercialize its unique portfolio of intellectual property assets through its licensing and enforcement operations (“Licensing and Enforcement”). Prior to 2017 the Company operated a second line of business that focused on helping companies innovate more effectively and efficiently (“Innovation Business”). The Company accomplished this by offering custom innovation services to large companies desiring to prototype and scale new businesses and new business methods. Prior to March 31, 2016, the Company also had a custom innovation product for small and medium businesses called Haystack IQ™ (“Haystack IQ”), which used proprietary Big Data software to connect the global stockpile of technology improvements and technical experts, represented by the U.S. patent database and other technical databases, with businesses that can put them into commercial uses that help them compete and grow. On March 31, 2016, the Company ceased operations of its Haystack IQ product, and recorded a one-time non-recurring charge of approximately $575,000. 
 
In response to the challenging developments in the patent licensing and enforcement environment, and the decision to cease operations of the Innovation Business, our current plan of operations includes a more focused Licensing and Enforcement program, and an effort to acquire, through merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, plan of arrangement, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination, one or more operating businesses, either within its current verticals or in new industry segments, or control of such operating businesses through contractual arrangements. An investment bank has been retained to advise the Company on its acquisition process and other opportunities to create shareholder value.
 
Walker Digital, LLC (“Walker Digital”), a related party, is the owner of approximately 82% of the voting interest in the Company and owns approximately 48% of the economic interest in the Company.
 
The Company is led by entrepreneur and inventor Jay Walker, who is best known as the founder of Priceline.com and has twice been named by TIME magazine as “one of the top 50 business leaders of the digital age.” Mr. Walker currently ranks as the world’s 13th most patented living individual, based on U.S. patent issuances according to Wikipedia.
 
Business
 
Prior to fiscal 2017, the Company operated in two primary segments of business, its Licensing and Enforcement business, and its Innovation Business. In the first quarter of 2016 the Company ceased operations of its Innovation Businesses.
Licensing and Enforcement
 
The Company seeks to develop, license and otherwise enforce patented technologies through its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company generates revenues from the granting of intellectual property rights for the use of, or pertaining to, its patented technologies. The Company may also monetize its intellectual property through the sale and/or licensing of select patent assets. Patent protection is a key part of the Company’s business model, because it provides the Company with a period of exclusive ownership during which the Company has the opportunity to recoup risk capital and generate a profit from inventions. 
 
All of our intellectual property assets were created with the goal of solving business problems, with the intent to achieve commercial status. However, it is our belief that certain of our inventions have become part of the commercial activities of other businesses without having been licensed, depriving us of financial value. As a result, focused patent enforcement and licensing activities are a component of our business strategy. During the past three fiscal years the Company has entered into patent infringement lawsuits (including two counterclaims in declaratory judgment actions) and/or licenses, involving 9 different issued patents. These enforcement and licensing efforts involving previously filed cases have resulted in $3.6 million in gross revenue from settlement and licensing income since January 2015. There are currently no pending litigation matters. We continue to investigate other infringers and may expand enforcement activities to other unlicensed users of previously asserted patents. Our litigation matters are disclosed below under
