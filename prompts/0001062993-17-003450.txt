Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. 
 In this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all references to shares refer to shares of common stock in the capital of our company. 
 As used in this annual report on Form 10-K, the terms we, us our and Garmatex Holdings refer to Garmatex Holdings Ltd., a Nevada corporation, and our wholly-owned subsidiary, ORC Exploration LLC, a Nevada corporation, unless otherwise specified. 
 Our Corporate History and Background 
 We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 9, 2014. Our fiscal year end is April 30. Following incorporation, we commenced the business of a mineral exploration company. On May 8, 2014, we incorporated our wholly-owned subsidiary, ORC Exploration LLC, for the purposes of mineral exploration. On May 20, 2014, we acquired an option to acquire a 100% legal and beneficial ownership interest in the Elizabeth mineral claim, located in the Omineca Mining District in the central part of the Province of British Columbia. Our initial mining exploration program, which was scheduled to commence in the second quarter of the fiscal year ending April 30, 2015, was delayed until the fourth quarter due to forest fire concerns.

Due to a dearth of available financing options, which has affected many junior mining companies in recent years, we subsequently ran out of funds to proceed with our planned exploration program. As a result, our management decided to seek out other potential business operations and management skills for the continuation of our business. In connection therewith, effective June 8, 2015, our chief executive officer (“CEO”) and sole director, Jose Montes, resigned all positions as an officer and director of our company, and we appointed Mike Gilliland to serve as our sole officer and director. Effective March 14, 2016, Mr. Gilliland resigned all positions as an officer and director of our company, and we appointed Devon Loosdrecht to serve as our sole officer and director. 
  On April 8, 2016, we entered into an arrangement agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with Garmatex Technologies, Inc. (“GTBC”), a private company incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding securities of GTBC in exchange for the issuance of equivalent securities of our company by way of a statutory arrangement (the “Arrangement”) under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). The Arrangement Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and conditions to closing. The Arrangement Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and conditions to closing. The closing of the Arrangement Exchange (the “Closing”) would only occur once we complete a name change, forward stock-split and was provided with audited financial statements from Garmatex, with such financial statements being prepared by an independent accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). 
  Effective August 15, 2016, we completed a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Garmatex Holdings. Ltd., a Nevada corporation, which was incorporated solely to effect a change in our name. As a result, we have changed our name from “Oaxaca Resources Corp.” to “Garmatex Holdings Ltd.”. Also, effective August 15, 2016, we effected a twelve and one-half to one forward stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital of common stock increased from 90,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 to 1,125,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 and our previously outstanding 2,520,000 shares of common stock increased to 31,500,000 shares of common stock outstanding. There are no shares of preferred stock currently outstanding. We changed our name and effected forward-split as per the terms and conditions of the Arrangement Agreement. 
  As of the date of this report, the Arrangement Agreement with GTBC has expired as conditions of the merger had not yet been satisfied. We continue to negotiate with GTBC with the intention of reaching a new agreement. All other agreements between us and GTBC remain intact. 
  We entered into and executed a non-exclusive Sublicense Agreement dated March 8, 2017 and the Garmatex Trademark & Technology License Agreement dated March 9, 2017 (collectively, “Master Sublicense Agreement”) with Garmatex Technologies, Inc. a company formed under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada (“GTBC”) whereby we were granted various Intellectual Property Rights related to the design, development and manufacturing of various scientifically-engineered fabric technologies and performance technologies; including a patented T3® design, Bact-Out®, CoolSkin®, WarmSkin®, Kottinu™, ColdSkin™, SteelSkin™, Satinu™, CamoSkin™, RecoverySkin™, SlimSkin™, AbsorbSkin™ and IceSkin™ (collectively the foregoing are referred to hereinafter as the “Licensed IP”). 
  Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we acquired the rights to further develop, commercialize, market and distribute certain proprietary inventions and know-how related to the Products. In exchange, we agreed to the following terms and conditions: (i) the Parties shall enter into Amendment No. 1 to the Arrangement Agreement; and (ii) we agreed to cancel various loans made pursuant to a Loan Agreement between us and GTBC in the aggregate amount of $953,988.00CDN.
 Following the execution of the Master Sublicense Agreement and the grant of the license thereunder related to the Licensed IP, we are now able to fully implement our intended business plan and plan of operations.

Our Business
  We plan to provide performance fabric solutions in virtually every sector that has textile applications. Our primary strategy is to deploy our performance fabrics as a premium ingredient brand, similar to Gore-Tex® in the outerwear market, or akin to Intel® in the computer space. We believe that our future fabrics will be superior in performance relative to current market “standards” and have a wide range of applications in multiple clothing and textile categories including, but not limited to, sports apparel, medical, sleepwear, linens, undergarments, military, designer wear, protective, industrial and first responders. 
  Our business model is to co-develop fabric with manufacturers to obtain exclusive licenses of technology and purchase fabric technology to build on our technology portfolio. We plan to commercialize these inventions by selling bolts of fabric directly to retailers and wholesalers. We plan to control the proprietary process of the technology for IP protection and do not intend to own any manufacturing facilities, which will effectively allow us to scale. 
  We are in the market to further acquire technologies from inventors looking for a commercialization partner. 
  Currently, we do not have a source of revenue. We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. Historically, we have been able to raise a limited amount of capital through private placements of our equity stock, but we are uncertain about our continued ability to raise funds privately. 
  Industry overview
 In 2014, global exports for textiles and apparel totaled approximately US$797 bn. Of that total, $314bn totaled textile and world apparel totaled $483bn. 
  In 2014, the worldwide use of fibers amounted to 90.1 million tonnes, up by 4.4% . The sizeable acceleration in growth compared with a rise of 1.5% in 2011 was realized despite persistent economic uncertainties and still negative growth in Europe.
 The market size of 90.1 million tonnes corresponds with an average per capita consumption of 12.7kg. The growth rate in 2014 of 4.4% succeeded in outperforming the long-term growth rate of 2.8% since 1970 and the short-term average annual growth of 3.5% since the year 2000. The recent acceleration of fiber demand reflects the impact of rapidly rising disposable incomes in populous nations like the BRIC- countries.
 The market trend has unabatedly shifted toward manmade fibers that hold a 67% share at present, up from 54% in 2000. This trend will continue as the International Cotton Advisory Committee expects negative impacts from the Chinese cotton policy and the cost difference to polyester.
  Increasing costs of production for cotton and a reduction of land for cotton will slow growth and present more opportunities for synthetic fibers to grow as a percentage of the market. 
  The most readily addressable consumer market segments for our company are the sporting apparel and medical verticals, where innovations in performance are critically needed. 
  Performance fabric and performance apparel market segment

Due to the competitive nature of the sports world, within which persists a constant need for extra advantage, performance-based product has skyrocketed in sales in recent years and will continue to see significant growth. Estimated at $150 billion today, Allied Market Research forecasts the world sports apparel market is expected to generate revenue of $184.6 billion by 2020. 
 Hospital linens and the medical segment
Hospital acquired infections are a major issue in hospitals and care facilities. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated roughly 1.7 million hospital-associated infections, from all types of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, cause or contribute to 99,000 deaths each year. In Europe, where hospital surveys have been conducted, the category of gram-negative infections are estimated to account for two-thirds of the 25,000 deaths each year. Nosocomial infections can cause severe pneumonia and infections of the urinary tract, bloodstream and other parts of the body. Many types are difficult to treat with antibiotics. In addition, antibiotic resistance can complicate treatment. The spread of infection through bacteria is something that can be prevented with linens that stop bacteria growth. 
 Garmatexs Kottinu®  with the antimicrobial properties of Bact-Out®  is poised to penetrate the medical segment as an alternative to non-performing, cotton-based materials or materials based on synthetics that are more susceptible to harbouring microbial growths. 
 Kottinu® linens wick away moisture and dry at a faster rate in comparison to charged cotton sheets. Faster drying times translate to energy savings in the laundering process. Kottinu® can extend the lifespan of the linen because it is a synthetic fabric while cotton break down faster. Minimal or no shrinkage, along with stain resistance, are also attributes of synthetic fabrics which outperform cotton over time and can lead to less product being taken out of circulation. With its cotton-like feel Kottinu® offers an aesthetic appeal and comfort for linen users. 
 Competitive environment and competitive strengths
The competitive environment is divided into two key categories. 1) Fabric mills that sell directly to manufacturers. These fabric mills are identified by some of the following characteristics: typically serve a geographic region, do not have consumer facing technology, and are typically low-cost producers. 2) Technology providers like Gore-Tex, Invista and Lenzing brand their fibers and sell their yarn directly to fabric mills, while ensuring that their branding is consumer facing with hangtags, and they sell to mills all over the world. In many instances, they work directly with the wholesaler or retailer who choose to use their technology in the apparel or other finished good. This second type of competitor closely resembles our competition.
 Technology and Products

GTBC has coined and the term FiberithmTM to represent the dynamic methodology employed to develop its fabric technologies. FiberithmTM represents the testing, analysis and evaluation of fibers used in the manufacturing of fabrics and the resulting step-by-step protocols used to formulate the fabrics with particular qualities and performance characteristics. Each GTBC FiberithmTM is a building block, complete in itself, but with an open architecture enabling future development and improvement. To date, GTBC has developed over 40 distinct FiberithmTM protocols.

Moisture System Transference (MST) is the process which provides moisture management and at the core of our fabric technologies. MST microfiber technology bundles very fine, long-strand fibers called filaments to create performance threads. The unique blend and configuration of GTBCs filaments within the threads creates a greater surface area for moisture to travel along. The specific knitting pattern increases the speed of moisture movement through the fabric.

Bact-Out® is GTBCs antimicrobial protocol used in GTBCs performance fabrics. Third party tested fabrics with Bact-Out® showed a control of fungi gram positive/gram negative bacteria up to 99.98% after 50 machine washes. Bact-Out® also helps to reduce the ongoing problem of body odour transference into the fabrics.
 
GTBC offers several performance fabric and design innovations: CoolSkin®, Kottinu®, ColdSkin, RecoverySkin, WarmSkin®, SteelSkin, T3® Technology, SlimSkin, AbsorbSkinTM, IceSkinTM and SurfSkin.

 | CoolSkin®, GTBCs origin breakthrough product, is the genesis for most of our fabric technologies. It maximizes MST technology to move the skins moisture quickly to the surface of the fabric where it can evaporate. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Kottinu® provides a remarkable ultra-soft, cotton-like feel to microfiber. Combined with Bact-Out®, this product is an ideal replacement for cotton. 
 | ColdSkin uses a thermal reduction process to promote extra cooling where excess heat is built up. Infused with a natural cooling agent, it promotes reduced skin temperature and assists the body to maintain a more moderate temperature while in activity. 
 | RecoverySkin is primarily used for compression fit garments. Studies suggest that compression garments promote blood flow to key muscle groups which can reduce fatigue and lactic acid buildup while accelerating muscle recovery. 
 | WarmSkin® increases retention of the bodys natural heat while removing unwanted moisture from the skin. It can promote blood flow to key muscle groups which allows for comfortable performance in cold weather while reducing injuries common during cold weather activities. 
 | SteelSkin is a soft, pliable, woven, anti-abrasion fabric sewn into garment areas that are prone to abrasion, laceration or heavy wear. The fabric is five times stronger than steel on an equal weight basis and provides unparalleled protection with minimal weight. 
 | The T3® patented design resulted from an understanding of proportion and motion in the human body. The triple gusset construction design addresses all muscle groups affiliated with arm and shoulder rotational movement enabling freedom of movement by alleviating the binding and body ride-up associated with close fitting apparel. 
 | SlimSkin is a body-hugging fabric that accentuates shape while allowing for comfort of movement. 
 | AbsorbSkinTM absorbs up to 6 times its weight in moisture and is used in areas where a cushioning component is desired. 
 | IceSkin is engineered through a multi-layered, three-dimensional, knitting process and combines a high percentage of natural jade mineral with our CoolSkin® microfiber technology. IceSkin has proven to be effective in reducing skin surface temperate and can improve wearer efficiency while in activity. 
 | SurfSkin is a lightweight, woven fabric and its fast-drying properties makes it an ideal fabric for board shorts and surf wear.
