  Overview 
         We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of innovative, late-stage product candidates targeting neurological diseases, including rare disorders. Our product candidates are small molecules based on two distinct mechanistic platformscalcitonin gene-related peptide ("CGRP"), receptor antagonists and glutamate modulatorswhich we believe have the potential to significantly alter existing treatment approaches across a diverse set of neurologic indications with high unmet need in both large markets and orphan indications. The most advanced product candidate from our CGRP receptor antagonist platform is rimegepant, an orally available, potent and selective small molecule human CGRP receptor antagonist that we are developing for the acute treatment of migraine. We expect to receive the topline results of our two Phase 3 clinical trials in the first quarter of 2018. 
         Our glutamate platform includes three clinical-stage product candidates being developed for the treatment of various neurological indications: trigriluzole for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder ("OCD"), spinocerebellar ataxia ("SCA") and Alzheimer's disease; BHV-0223 for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis("ALS"); and BHV-5000 for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric illnesses such as Rett syndrome, neuropathic pain and treatment-resistant depression. One of our advanced product candidates from our glutamate platform is BHV-0223, which we are developing for the treatment of ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. We have received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for BHV-0223 in ALS, and we have observed results suggesting bioequivalence to Rilutek in a recently completed Phase 1 clinical trial. We plan to file a new drug application ("NDA") with the FDA for BHV-0223 in the second half of 2018. With respect to our next most advanced product candidate in our glutamate platform, trigriluzole, we expect to receive the results from an open-label 48-week extension study in SCA in the fourth quarter 2018. We expect to complete enrollment in our Phase 2 clinical trial of trigriluzole for the treatment of OCD by the end of 2018. With respect to BHV-5000, we initiated a Phase 1 study in December 2017 which we expect to be completed in the second half of 2018.

  Our CGRP Receptor Antagonist Platform 
   Migraine Overview and Market Opportunity 
         Migraine is a chronic and debilitating disorder characterized by recurrent attacks lasting four to 72 hours with multiple symptoms, including typically one-sided, pulsating headaches of moderate to severe pain intensity that are associated with nausea or vomiting, and/or sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) and sensitivity to light (photophobia). Migraines are often preceded by transient neurological warning symptoms, known as auras, which typically involve visual disturbances such as flashing lights, but may also involve numbness or tingling in parts of the body. Migraine is both widespread and disabling. The Migraine Research Foundation ranks migraine as the world's third most prevalent illness, and the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 rates migraine as the seventh highest specific cause of disability worldwide. According to the Migraine Research Foundation, in the United States, approximately 36 million individuals suffer from migraine attacks. While most sufferers experience migraine attacks once or twice per month, more than 4 million people have chronic migraine, defined as experiencing at least 15 headache days per month, of which at least eight are migraine, for more than three months. Others have episodic migraine, which is characterized by experiencing less than 15 migraine days per month. People with episodic migraine may progress to chronic migraine over time. Migraine attacks can last four hours or up to three days. More than 90% of individuals suffering from migraine attacks are unable to work or function normally during a migraine attack, with many experiencing comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety and insomnia. 
         Triptans are the current first-line therapy for treatment of migraine, with over 13.9 million annual prescriptions in the United States. Despite the market for triptans being highly genericized, branded options continue to be popular. For example, even at a price of approximately $400-600/month, Maxalt 
 2

   is a commonly prescribed triptan. There has been minimal improvement in the standard treatment for migraine since the early 1990s. Reformulations of generic triptans or incremental improvements with new agents that target the same pathway are predicted to generate additional sales in the near term, but major sales growth for the migraine market are expected from novel therapeutics over the next several years. We believe that rimegepant will be a potential best-in-class small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist for the acute treatment of migraine and could achieve meaningful penetration of the market of migraine sufferers whose symptoms are not adequately addressed with current treatments. 
         The prevention of migraine in the United States is a multi-billion dollar potential market. According to a report published by Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment, 38% to 50% of diagnosed migraine sufferers may be candidates for migraine prevention therapy. Currently, preventive medications approved for migraine include beta blockers, such as propranolol, topiramate, sodium valproate, and botulinum toxin ("Botox") and generate nearly 10 million prescriptions annually. 
         In patients with high frequency and chronic migraine, beta blockers, topiramate and sodium valproate are commonly used. These medications are often not well tolerated by patients because of adverse events ("AEs") such as cognitive impairment, nausea, fatigue and sleep disturbance. In clinical trials with topiramate, the reduction in number of migraine days per month has been observed to be relatively small; for example, migraine days reduced by 2.5 days from six to seven days at baseline, or reduced by 3.5 days from 15 to 16 days at baseline. Migraine is twice as prevalent in women as compared to men. In the affected female patient population, predominantly women of child-bearing age, the association of these agents with poor pregnancy outcomes and fetal abnormalities can limit their use. Botox is only approved for the prevention of migraine in patients diagnosed with chronic migraine. Approximately 47% of Botox-treated patients experience a 50% reduction in either migraine days per month or migraine frequency per month within six months, which leaves more than half of patients inadequately treated. In addition, the Botox dosing regimen consists of approximately 31 subcutaneous injections at various sites on the head and neck, with recommended repetition every 12 weeks if the patient has a therapeutic response. 
   CGRP's Role in Migraine 
         The CGRP receptor is located within pain-signaling pathways, intracranial arteries and mast cells and its activation is thought to play a causal role in migraine pathophysiology. For example, research and clinical studies have shown: serum levels of CGRP are elevated during migraine attacks, infusion of intravenous CGRP produces persistent pain in migraine sufferers and non-migraine sufferers, and treatment with anti-migraine drugs normalizes CGRP activity. Additionally, multiple clinical studies show that small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, which inhibit the binding of endogenous CGRP to CGRP receptors, are effective in diminishing migraine attacks. 
         Treatment with a CGRP receptor antagonist is believed to relieve migraine through the following mechanisms: 
 

 Blocking Neurogenic
Inflammation:  Binding of CGRP receptor antagonists to CGRP receptors located on mast cells inhibit inflammation caused by trigeminal nerve
release of CGRP onto mast cells within the tough outer covering of the brain, or the meninges. 
 Decreasing Artery Dilation:  By
blocking the CGRP receptors located in smooth muscle cells within vessel walls, CGRP receptor antagonists inhibit the pathologic dilation of intracranial arteries without the unwanted effect of active
vasoconstriction. 
 Inhibiting Pain
Transmission:  Binding of CGRP receptor antagonists to CGRP receptors suppress the transmission of pain by inhibiting the central relay of pain
signals from the trigeminal nerve to the caudal trigeminal nucleus.

   Our Lead Product Candidate: Rimegepant, an Oral CGRP Receptor Antagonist for Acute Treatment of Migraine 
         We are developing rimegepant as an orally available, selective and potent small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist for the acute treatment of migraine. We believe that rimegepant has the potential to be the best-in-class CGRP receptor antagonist for the treatment of migraine with the ability to address important unmet needs, such as durable efficacy across all four traditional migraine symptoms and reduced incidence of headache recurrence, without contraindications or warnings in patients with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension. 
         Rimegepant dosed at 75 mg was observed to have statistically significant, durable improvement as compared to placebo in a Phase 2b, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging clinical trial completed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ("BMS"). In this trial, 812 patients suffering from migraine attacks received either placebo, sumatriptan 100 mg (a currently approved triptan medication for migraine) or rimegepant dosed at 10, 25, 75, 150, 300 or 600 mg. The Phase 2b data showed statistically significant effects of rimegepant starting at the 75 mg dose compared to placebo, meaning 
 4

   that at this dose level, statistically significant results were observed on all four key migraine symptomspain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia. Higher doses of rimegepant, while also showing improvement compared to placebo, did not appear to convey any meaningful additional benefit above the 75 mg dose. The observed improvement profile is consistent with the published literature showing a lack of a progressive dose-response curve for anti-migraine drugs used in the acute treatment of migraine. To our knowledge and based on publicly available information, rimegepant is the only small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist currently in development that has achieved statistically significant improvement on all four of the traditional endpoints within a single study, which suggests a broad efficacy profile important both to patients and physicians. Rimegepant also was observed to have evidence of durable improvement as demonstrated by statistically significant effects on two-to-24 hour and two-to-48 hour pain freedom and two-to-24 hour pain relief, as compared to placebo. In these measurements, benefits were present at two hours after dosing and persisted through 24 hours after dosing and, with respect to pain freedom, through 48 hours after dosing. This durable improvement is significant because other common migraine medications, such as triptans, have been associated with headache recurrence. 
         The Phase 2b trial successfully completed its aim of identifying a Phase 3 dose. Based on these observations, we are advancing the 75 mg dose of rimegepant in our Phase 3 clinical trials. In July 2017, we initiated two Phase 3 clinical trials of rimegepant, and we completed enrollment in these trials in November 2017. We expect to receive topline results from both of these trials in the first quarter 2018. Additionally, in November 2017, we received agreement from the FDA of an initial pediatric study plan. In February 2018, we submitted a request for scientific advice for rimegepant to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP") a committee of the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") and we anticipate receiving feedback in the first half of 2018. 
         Those suffering from migraine often have accompanying nausea and have an aversion to consuming food or liquids during an attack. We are also developing an oral solid dosage formulation of rimegepant that disperses almost instantly in the mouth, without the need for water. The Zydis oral dissolving tablet ("ODT") formulation being utilized uniquely addresses this issue. Biohaven has exclusive worldwide rights to the Zydis ODT fast-dissolving formulation for the development of rimegepant pursuant to a January 2018 license agreement with Catalent U.K. Swindon Zydis Limited, a subsidiary of Catalent, Inc. ("Catalent"). The agreement also provides exclusivity with respect to other small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists with the Zydis ODT technology. In February 2018, a bioequivalence study was conducted to compare this new ODT formulation to the tablet in current clinical development and provided evidence of equivalence. A third Phase 3 efficacy study with rimegepant commenced in February 2018. This study, utilizing the new ODT formulation, is designed to replicate the other two ongoing Phase 3 studies and support the new formulation. The study is expected to complete in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
   Acute Treatment of Migraine and Limitation of Current Treatments 
         Clinicians use a number of pharmacologic agents for the acute treatment of migraine. A study published by the American Headache Society in 2015 concluded that the medications deemed effective for the acute treatment of migraine fell into the following classes: triptans, ergotamine derivatives, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ("NSAIDs"), opioids and combination medications. The current standard of care for the acute treatment of migraine is prescription of triptans, which are serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists. Triptans have been developed and approved for the acute treatment of migraine over the past two decades. The initial introduction of triptans represented a shift toward drugs more selectively targeting the suspected pathophysiology of migraine. While triptans account for almost 80% of anti-migraine therapies prescribed at office visits by healthcare providers, issues such as an incomplete effect or headache recurrence remain important clinical limitations. In fact, only about 30% of patients from clinical trials are pain free at two hours after taking triptans. In addition, triptans are 
 5

   contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or significant risk factors for either because of potential systemic and cerebrovascular vasoconstriction from the 5-HT1B-mediated effects. The package insert for triptans includes warnings and precautions for migraine patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease and states that high risk patients, including those with increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity or a strong family history of coronary artery disease, should be evaluated prior to receiving the first dose of a triptan. Triptans are contraindicated in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease, coronary artery vasospasm, history of stroke, peripheral vascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension. Even in patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, product labeling for triptans recommends that consideration be given to administration of the first dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram immediately following administration. Additionally, periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered for long-term users of triptans who have cardiovascular risk factors. According to a January 2017 study published in the journal Headache, an estimated 2.6 million migraine sufferers in the United States have a cardiovascular event, condition or procedure that limits the potential of triptans as a treatment option. Thus, we believe there remains a significant unmet medical need for a novel migraine-specific medication that does not increase the risk of cardiovascular liability. 
   The Potential Benefits of Rimegepant Compared to Other Treatments 
         Traditionally, for approval of drugs for the acute treatment of migraine, the FDA required the drug to meet four co-primary endpoints at two hours after dosage in clinical trials: pain freedom or pain relief, and freedom from nausea, phonophobia and photophobia. In October 2014, the FDA issued new, less stringent draft guidance (and formal guidance in February 2018) indicating that pivotal migraine trials could use a preferred approach of co-primary 2-hour endpoints of freedom from pain and freedom from most bothersome symptom (among nausea, photophobia or phonophobia) to support approval. We believe rimegepant may be superior to other acute treatments for migraine currently approved and in development because, based on our Phase 2b clinical trial data, rimegepant was observed to result in statistically significant improvement in all four endpoints of pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia at the 75 mg dose, compared to placebo, with a favorable safety profile. 
         The table below compares key features of rimegepant to two other product candidates targeting the acute treatment of migraine that are currently in development and that we anticipate could receive marketing approval as early as 2019-2020, and to CGRP antibodies, which represent another class of 
 6

   migraine-targeting product candidates in development and which target migraine prevention rather than acute treatment of migraine. 
 
        Based on the results from the Phase 2b trial and earlier-stage development, we believe rimegepant offers the following clinical and product benefits for the acute treatment of migraine: 
 

 Oral Availability.  To our
knowledge, rimegepant is one of only two small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists that is currently in late-stage clinical development and that offers patients convenient oral administration. 
 Comprehensive Treatment
Effect.  In the Phase 2b trial, the 75 mg dose of rimegepant showed statistically significant improvement as compared to placebo across all
four key migraine symptoms (pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia), while the other small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists currently in development have failed to show statistically significant
improvement on nausea, and also failed to show significant improvement on pain relief. 
 Durable Improvement.  In the
Phase 2b trial, the improvement of the 75 mg dose of rimegepant on pain freedom was statistically significant at two-to-24 hours and two-to-48 hours after dosing, and on pain
relief was statistically significant at two and 24 hours after dosing, in each as compared to placebo, showing durability of treatment effect. 
 Favorable Safety Profile.  In the
Phase 2b trial, rimegepant was generally well tolerated with low rates of AEs, no discontinuations for AEs, no treatment-related serious adverse events ("SAEs") and no deaths. AEs in the 75 mg
treatment group were comparable to the placebo group, and most AEs across all treatment groups were mild to moderate in intensity and dose-dependent. Rimegepant does not cross the blood brain barrier,
so there is low potential for centrally mediated AEs. In addition, the preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that CGRP receptor antagonists, such as rimegepant, have an absence of vasoconstrictor
activity and lack other undesirable cardiovascular side effects, such as changes in the blood pressure or heart rate, that are commonly associated with triptans. 

 7



 Potency.  Rimegepant is highly
potent with subnanomolar affinity for the human CGRP receptor, which allows for a relatively low dose to provide maximal treatment effect. 
 Lower Expected Cost.  We expect
that as a small molecule, rimegepant will have a lower cost of goods than CGRP antibodies, which are biologics. 

   The Potential of CGRP Antagonists: Novel mechanism of action without causing vasoconstriction 
         The release of the neuropeptide CGRP from pain nerves is believed to play a causal role in the underlying pathophysiology of migraine and is also a potent dilator of intracranial arteries. Unlike triptans, which possess potent vasoconstrictive properties that could worsen cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, blocking the CGRP receptor reverses pathologic dilation of blood vessels without constricting them past their normal resting state size and without active vasoconstriction. The absence of cardiovascular effects may prove to be one of the major advantages in the use of CGRP receptor antagonists for the treatment of migraine. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the use of CGRP receptor antagonists may be effective in treating migraine by blocking the pathophysiological processes associated with CGRP release, specifically by: (1) inhibiting pain transmission; (2) decreasing artery dilation without any active vasoconstriction; and (3) halting neurogenic inflammation. To date, the preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that CGRP receptor antagonists have an absence of vasoconstrictor activity and lack other undesirable cardiovascular side effects, such as changes in the blood pressure or heart rate. Studies of numerous drugs in development have provided proof of concept of the effects of CGRP targeting agents in humans. 
   Our Clinical Program for Rimegepant in Acute Treatment of Migraine 
         We licensed rimegepant from BMS in July 2016. To date, the majority of data has been derived from clinical and preclinical development with rimegepant conducted by BMS. BMS selected rimegepant as a lead CGRP receptor antagonist compound for its potential best-in-class chemical profile after 10 years of research on this drug target. 



Phase 2b Clinical Trial Design and Results 

         Rimegepant is being developed for oral administration and was observed to have evidence of comprehensive and durable treatment effect in a large Phase 2b clinical trial conducted by BMS. This Phase 2b clinical trial, the results of which were published in 2014, was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of rimegepant compared with placebo in the acute treatment of migraine as measured by pain freedom (headache pain intensity level reported as "no pain") at two hours post-dosing using a four point rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain) while identifying an optimal dose to support the Phase 3 clinical trials. Subjects were randomized to receive placebo, a 100 mg dose of sumatriptan or one of six doses of rimegepant (10 mg, 25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, or 600 mg). Randomization made use of an adaptive design, whereby one quarter of subjects were assigned placebo and one-eighth were assigned sumatriptan; the remainder were assigned to one of six rimegepant groups based on a Bayesian analysis of the observed response rates. Subjects were instructed to treat one migraine of moderate to severe pain intensity and return to the clinic within seven days. 
         A total of 885 subjects were randomized and 812 completed the study (the remaining subjects did not experience a migraine during the treatment phase of the trial). Key entry criteria included: age 18 to 65 inclusive with at least a one-year history of migraine beginning prior to 50 years of age; migraine attacks lasting four to 72 hours if left untreated; not more than eight attacks per month of moderate or greater severity over the prior three months; and less than 15 total headache days per month (migraine plus non-migraine) in each of the three preceding months. 
 8

           Patients were given an electronic diary to record improvements and returned to the study site within seven days of study treatment for review of the data. Patients who experienced relief of headache pain to a mild intensity or pain-free intensity level at two hours post-dosing were considered to be responders. The patients who did not experience such relief at the end of two hours were permitted to use an approved rescue medication. Use of rescue medication within 48 hours was also recorded. Whatever the case, the patient was required to continue to complete his or her electronic diary for up to 48 hours after dosing. Secondary efficacy variables included total migraine freedom: a composite endpoint consisting of freedom from headache pain coupled with no symptoms of photophobia, phonophobia or nausea, at two hours post-dosing, and sustained pain freedom from two-to-24 hours. Exploratory measures included pain relief at two hours post-dosing, sustained pain relief from two-to-24 hours post-dosing, freedom from photophobia, phonophobia or nausea at two hours post-dosing, and sustained pain freedom from two-to-48 hours post-dosing. Safety variables included AEs, SAEs, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital sign measurements, physical examinations, and electrocardiograms ("ECGs"). The following graphic illustrates the study design of the Phase 2b clinical trial: 
 
        With regard to the primary study outcome, the percentage of patients who were pain free at two hours after dosing is depicted in the figure below. The rimegepant 75 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg dose groups each were significantly superior to placebo (p £ 0.01). Among the rimegepant dose groups, the percentage of subjects who were pain free at two hours after dosing was 31.4% (27/86) in the 75 mg group; 32.9% (28/85) in the 150 mg group; and 29.7% (33/111) in the 300 mg group, compared to 
 9

   15.2% of patients in the placebo group. Statistical separation from placebo was not seen with the 600 mg group (24.4%, 20/82) as compared to the lower doses. 
  Pain Freedom 2 hours Post-Dosing (+/95% Confidence) 
 
        The table below shows the percentage of patients in the placebo, sumatriptan, and each rimegepant dose groups who experienced pain freedom and pain relief in the trial, and the corresponding p-values. P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. A p-value of 0.05 represents statistical significance, meaning that there is only a 5% likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. The table shows that rimegepant 75 mg showed statistically significant improvements compared to placebo on sustained pain freedom from two-to-24 hours and two-to-48 hours post-dose, on pain relief two hours post-dose and on sustained pain relief from two-to-24 hours post-dose (all with a 0.1% likelihood that the observed results were merely due to chance). 
 
        The figure below shows the percentage of patients who reported sustained pain freedom and sustained pain relief at two-to-24 hours after dosing among the placebo dose group, the sumatriptan 
 10

   dose group, and each dose group of rimegepant. Rimegepant was statistically superior to placebo on pain freedom and pain relief at two-to-24 hours across all dose groups 75 mg and above. 
  Sustained Pain Freedom and Pain Relief 2-24 Hours Post-Dosing (+/95% Confidence) 
 
        The figure below shows the Phase 2 trial results for the three other traditional co-primary endpoints previously required by the FDAfreedom from nausea, phonophobia and photophobia, showing the proportion of patients with alleviation of these symptoms at two hours after dosing in the placebo dose group, the sumatriptan dose group, and in each of the rimegepant dose groups. Rimegepant 75 mg was statistically superior to placebo on nausea, photophobia and phonophobia freedom at two hours after dosing. 
 Nausea, Phonophobia and Photophobia Freedom 2 Hours Post-Dosing (+/95% Confidence) 
 
        With regard to safety and tolerability in the Phase 2 clinical trial, the overall incidence of AEs was comparable across the placebo and rimegepant treatment groups. The most commonly seen AE in the rimegepant dosing groups was nausea, which appeared to exhibit a dose dependent trend at the higher 
 11

   doses: 1.4% in the 10 mg dose group; 0% in the 25 mg dose group; 3% in each of the 75 mg and 150 mg dose groups; 4% in the 300 mg dose group; and 8% in the 600 mg dose group. Importantly, although the patient numbers were small, the reported events of chest discomfort, chest pain, muscle tightness, and jaw pain were only observed in the sumatriptan-treated patients, with no rimegepant treated patients reporting chest pain-related symptoms. Most of the AEs reported were mild to moderate in intensity. Two SAEs were reported (post-lumbar puncture headache and pneumonia), but neither was deemed by the trial investigators to be treatment-related. No deaths were reported, and no patients discontinued because of AEs. There were no clinically important ECG findings, vital sign abnormalities, or physical examination findings after administration of rimegepant. 
         The table below shows the number and percentage of patients reporting a commonly occurring AE within 48 hours post-dosing. Rimegepant was generally well tolerated with no events of chest discomfort and low rate of AEs across dose groups. 
 
        Treatment-emergent AEs that occurred within two hours post-dosing were reported most often in the sumatriptan group (10.0%), followed by the 600 mg (8.3%), 300 mg (8.0%), 150 mg (7.0%), 10 mg (6.9%), 25 mg (4.8%), and the 75 mg (4.7%) dose groups, and the placebo group (2.9%). In the rimegepant dose groups, the most common AEs reported within two hours post-dosing were primarily low rates of dizziness and somnolence, and gastrointestinal disorders, primarily nausea and vomiting. 
         The liver has been a target of interest in certain small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, as indications of liver toxicity have been associated with frequent use. In the Phase 2b trial, one patient in the rimegepant 75 mg dose group and one patient in the placebo group had a report of an asymptomatic and mild increase in certain hepatic enzymes, which are types of liver enzyme measured in a liver function test to detect damage and inflammation to the liver. The subject in the rimegepant 75 mg dose group had peak alanine transaminase ("ALT") and aspartate transaminase ("AST") elevations that were less than 1.22 times the upper limit of normal ("ULN") and reported as an AE, while the placebo subject had a total bilirubin level that was greater than 2xULN. No subjects in the Phase 2b trial had AST or ALT elevation that exceeded 3xULN, a level that is considered to be a potentially meaningful indicator of a drug's potential to cause severe drug-induced liver injury ("DILI"), based on FDA guidance. 
         In conclusion, in the Phase 2b clinical trial, rimegepant was observed to be superior to placebo in the acute treatment of migraine and the trial identified the lowest dose that is fully effective in patients. More specifically, the selection of 75 mg rimegepant as the dose for advancement in Phase 3 trials was based on observed improvement as compared to placebo on the key primary outcome measure, pain freedom at two hours (31.4% vs 15.2% placebo; p = 0.0018) and key secondary and exploratory outcome measures: total migraine freedom at two hours (27.9% vs 11.8%; p = 0.0008), 
 12

   sustained pain freedom two-to-24 hours (27.9% vs 7.4%, p < 0.0001), freedom from photophobia at two hours (41.9% vs 24.0%, p = 0.0023), freedom from phonophobia at two hours (52.3% vs 27.9%, p < 0.0001), freedom from nausea at two hours (67.4% vs 51.0%, p = 0.0074), pain relief at two hours (72.1% vs 51.2%, p = 0.0007), and sustained pain relief from two-to-24 hours (69.8% vs 42.4%, p < 0.0001). Notably, rimegepant is the only small molecule and orally available CGRP receptor antagonist that has shown statistically significant improvement on the key migraine symptoms of pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia in a single trial. 
 


Phase 3 Clinical Trial Development Plan 

         Based on the results of the Phase 2 clinical trial, we elected to advance the 75 mg dose of rimegepant in our Phase 3 clinical trials. According to FDA 2014 draft guidance for developing drugs for acute treatment of migraine, approval for this indication has historically involved the demonstration of an effect on four co-primary endpoints: pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia. More recently, the agency has considered an alternate approach and in the recently published FDA 2018 formal guidance indicated as the "preferred approach" for approval based on an effect at 2 hours on headache pain freedom and freedom from a patient's most bothersome migraine symptom, or MBS, selected as either nausea, photophobia or phonophobia. Using this approach, the two co-primary endpoints would be (1) having no headache pain at two hours after dosing and (2) a demonstrated effect on freedom from the MBS at two hours after dosing. Regardless of the associated symptom identified as most bothersome, the FDA guidance states that all three important migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) should be assessed as secondary endpoints. 
         We had an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in March 2017 and we commenced two Phase 3 clinical trials in July 2017. We completed enrollment in these trials in November 2017. Approximately 3,000 patients were enrolled and 2,300 patients randomized across these two Phase 3 trials. We expect to receive topline results from both of these trials in the first quarter of 2018. Additionally, in November 2017, we also received agreement from the FDA on an initial pediatric study plan. We submitted a request for scientific advice to CHMP for rimegepant in February of 2018, and we anticipate receiving feedback in the first half of 2018. 
         Both Phase 3 trials conform to the FDA guidance for approval in acute treatment of migraine. The trials are double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled. The trials recruited male and female patients 18-65 years of age with at least a one year history of migraine, including an age of onset prior to 50, migraine attacks that last about four to 72 hours, not more than eight attacks of moderate to severe intensity per month within the last three months and not less than two attacks per month. Our goal was to enroll patients who represent the spectrum of real-world migraineurs, including those who have previously been non-responsive to triptans, as the FDA stated to us at our end of Phase 2 meeting that triptan-resistant patients may benefit from rimegepant treatment. We also enrolled patients who have cardiovascular risk factors and/or vascular disease. The primary objective of the trials is to evaluate the efficacy of 75 mg of rimegepant compared with placebo in the acute treatment of migraine as measured by two co-primary endpoints: (1) pain freedom (headache pain intensity level reported as "no pain") at two hours after dosing using a four-point numeric rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain) and (2) freedom from the MBS at two hours after dosing. The three other important migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) will be assessed as secondary endpoints, consistent with FDA guidance.

        In designing the Phase 3 trials, care was taken to minimize any changes in study populations compared to the already completed Phase 2 trial with rimegepant with no major changes in inclusion and exclusion criteria between the completed and planned trials. The main differences in trial design between the previous Phase 2 trials and our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials include: 
 

1.Change in the primary outcome measure and statistical analysis plan to conform to recent FDA
guidance.    The Phase 2b trial identified pain freedom at two hours as the primary outcome measure and included various secondary and exploratory outcome
measures to assess the associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia and phonophobia. The Phase 3 trials utilize pain freedom and freedom from MBS at two hours after dosing as co-primary
endpoints. In addition, to conform to recent FDA developments, and confirmed in our recent regulatory interactions, we intend to analyze the data collected in our Phase 3 trials on a
non-completer-equals-failure (NC=F) basis, rather than on a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) basis used in the Phase 2b trial;
2.Number of treatment arms.    The Phase 2b trial included six different dose groups of rimegepant,
sumatriptan and placebo arms. The Phase 3 trials only include 75 mg rimegepant versus placebo, since 75 mg rimegepant was identified as the lowest dose in the Phase 2b trial at which
improvements were observed in the four key migraine symptoms; and
3.Increase in sample size.    The two Phase 3 trials enrolled approximately 3,000 patients with the aim
of treating around 550 patients per arm with placebo or 75 mg rimegepant, respectively, in each trial; whereas in the Phase 2b trial 203 patients received placebo and just under
100 patients per arm received rimegepant. This increase in sample size is expected to support statistical comparisons on both primary and secondary endpoints. 

         This change in the hierarchy of outcome measures, sample size and number of treatment arms reflect somewhat standard changes in clinical trial design to increase technical and regulatory chances of success in the registrational program. We also developed a commercial-grade, tablet formulation of rimegepant that we are using in our Phase 3 clinical trials. 
         In August 2017, we commenced a long-term safety study to meet FDA requirements for approval. This study will be a 12-month, long-term, open label safety study conducted in patients with migraine. Two thousand patients will be treated in this study. A subset of approximately 600 patients will have a history of more frequent migraine attacks (i.e., more than eight migraine attacks per month) and will be able to take up to 30 doses of 75 mg rimegepant in one month. At our end of Phase 2 meeting, the FDA stated its desire to see a safety study in which patients received daily or near-daily dosing of rimegepant for at least three months. This desire stems from the FDA's concern about a potential liver signal with the class of CGRP antagonists. The FDA stated that any risk of liver injury has to be very low and that exposure with the drug has to be sufficient to cap the risk of liver injury at a level acceptable for the migraine population. We believe the design of our long-term safety study may adequately address this concern by providing for the enrollment of approximately 600 patients who experience nine to fourteen migraine episodes per month and will be allowed to use rimegepant on a daily basis, which we believe will generate safety data with respect to long-term, frequent use of rimegepant. Importantly, we believe this study design, where patients are allowed to take up to 30 doses of 75 mg rimegepant in one month, embraces the FDA guidance for conduct of a long-term safety trial during which patients can treat all acute migraine episodes with the investigational drug. Study visits for all patients will be monthly for the first three months and every three months thereafter. Based on feedback we received at our end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, we will administer liver function testing at two weeks post-dose and will follow patients with any abnormal liver function tests until clinical resolution. We expect sufficient clinical data needed for filing an NDA for rimegepant will be available by the end of 2018. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 1,100 patients are enrolled in this study, and we expect enrollment to be complete in the first half of 2018.

           Those suffering from migraine often have accompanying nausea and have an aversion to consuming food or liquids during an attack. We are also developing an oral solid dosage formulation of rimegepant that disperses almost instantly in the mouth, without the need for water. The Zydis ODT formulation uniquely addresses this issue. Biohaven has exclusive worldwide rights to the Zydis ODT fast-dissolving formulation for the development of rimegepant through a January 2018 license agreement with Catalent. The agreement also provides exclusivity with respect to other small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists with the Zydis ODT technology. In February 2018, a bioequivalence study was conducted to compare this new ODT formulation to the tablet in current clinical development and provided evidence of equivalence. A third Phase 3 clinical trial with rimegepant commenced in February 2018. This study, utilizing the new ODT formulation, is designed to replicate the other two ongoing Phase 3 trials. The trial compares placebo to 75 mg of the ODT formulation and will randomize approximately 850 patients with migraine to evaluate approximately 425 patients per treatment arm. We expect to complete this Phase 3 clinical trial in the fourth quarter 2018. 
 


Clinical Trials with Rimegepant 

         As of March 2, 2018, thirteen clinical trials have been completed (enrollment and treatment completed) in healthy volunteers and patients with migraine that inform pharmacokinetic, metabolic interactions, safety, tolerability and efficacy of rimegepant. Rimegepant has been observed to be generally safe and well tolerated in humans when given as single oral doses up to the maximum dose of 1500 mg and multiple oral doses up to the maximum daily dose of 600 mg for 14 days. No deaths have occurred in clinical trials to date. Currently, there are three ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials, one Phase 2/3 long-term safety study as well as two ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials, with one more Phase 1 expected to commence in the second quarter of 2018. These Phase 1 trials included evaluation of important drug-drug interactions looking at the effect of administering itraconazole, rifampin or fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics ("PK") of rimegepant. Also included are population studies to evaluate any differences seen in PK in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, as well as differences in PK that could be seen in the elderly. We expect to initiate a cardiac conduction study ("TQT study") in 2018. 
         Prior to the initiation of our Phase 3 clinical trials, approximately 687 subjects had been dosed with rimegepant. In Phase 1 and 2b trials, approximately 600 subjects have received single doses of rimegepant, ranging from 25 mg to 1500 mg; and approximately 87 subjects have received multiple doses of rimegepant, ranging from 75 mg to 600 mg daily for up to 14 days. In total, we believe the current data suggests a favorable benefit-risk profile for rimegepant in the acute treatment of migraine attacks. The clinical experience with rimegepant to date has allowed the characterization of safety and tolerability at substantial multiples of the intended therapeutic dose and intended frequency of use. Rimegepant has been assessed in single doses up to 1500 mg and in multiple doses from 75 mg to 600 mg with 14 days of dosing (including 300 mg twice daily), where the higher doses yielded exposures more than 54 times greater in area under the curve ("AUC"), which is a measure of drug exposure, and 23 times higher in Cmax, which is the peak concentration that a drug achieves after dosing, as compared to the mean therapeutic exposure of a single 75 mg dose. These high exposure multiples were observed to be generally well tolerated. 
         In completed rimegepant trials for which the results have been unblinded, as of March 2, 2018, three SAEs have been reported in rimegepant-treated patients. None of these SAEs were considered to be related to study drug: one subject had an SAE of severe post-lumbar puncture headache seven days after exposure to a single dose of rimegepant that was considered unrelated to study treatment, one subject had stress related cardiomyopathy that occurred 8 days after a single dose of rimegepant that was considered unrelated to study treatment, and one subject had an SAE of moderate pneumonia with onset five days after exposure to a single dose of rimegepant that was considered unrelated to study treatment. In addition, one subject who received placebo experienced an SAE (appendicitis).

           Since no data are available regarding the effects of rimegepant on human fetuses or newborns, women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth control and have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test to be eligible to receive rimegepant. Female subjects should avoid attempts at pregnancy in the month prior to exposure to rimegepant and eight weeks after exposure to rimegepant. All urine pregnancy testing results must be confirmed by serum pregnancy testing. Drug interaction studies with oral contraceptives demonstrated modest increase in exposure to estrogen and norelgestromin upon multiple doses of rimegepant 75 mg. Co-administration of rimegepant with oral contraceptives was safe and well tolerated. These results enabled enrollment of women of child bearing potential receiving oral contraceptives to be enrolled in the Phase 3 studies. 
   Nonclinical Toxicology 
         Rimegepant is not genotoxic or phototoxic and has a low potential for off-target receptor interactions or effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory, and CNS systems. With repeated dosing up to three months, rimegepant was clinically tolerated at up to 150 mg/kg/day in rats and 100 mg/kg/day in monkeys. No histopathologic liver findings were noted in monkeys treated for 3 months at all doses (the highest dose yielded an AUC exposure that was 120× the anticipated human AUC at a therapeutic dose of 75 mg/day). The liver was the primary target organ in mice at levels of 100 mg/kg/day and greater and in rats at levels of 60 mg/kg/day and greater. These dosing levels were not associated with hepatocellular degeneration/necrosis, inflammation, or fibrosis. In monkeys treated for 3 months, target organ effects were limited to minimal to moderate macrophage accumulation (histiocytosis) in mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes (considered to be a marginal exacerbation of a common spontaneous change in this species) at ³ 100 mg/kg/day. Hepatic lipidosis identified in mouse and rat studies was determined to be rodent specific as it was not observed at rimegepant exposures in monkeys which overlapped those producing lipid effects in rats in the three-month pivotal studies. At the NOEL (no observable effect level) and NOAEL (no observable adverse effect level) doses in rats (30 mg/kg/day) and monkeys (50 mg/kg/day) in the three-month studies, mean (male and female combined) AUC exposures were at least 23× (for rats) and 56× (for monkeys) the anticipated human AUC at a 75 mg/day clinical dose. Since fetal effects in rats were observed only at doses that produced maternal toxicity (300 mg/kg/day) and there were no fetal findings in rabbits at any dose level, rimegepant is not considered to be a selective developmental toxicant. 
         In a 6-month rat study, animals were administered rimegepant orally at daily doses of 0, 20, or 45 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was the high dose, 45 mg/kg/day with no evidence of toxicity at any dose. In a 9-month cynomolgus monkey study, animals were administered rimegepant orally at daily doses of 0, 15 or 50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was the high dose, 50 mg/kg/day with no evidence of toxicity at any dose level. Chronic administration to rats (6 months) and monkeys (9 months) demonstrated NOAEL values at doses of 45 and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively. Exposures were at least 29X (rat) and 17X (monkey) the anticipated human AUC at a 75 mg/day clinical dose. 
         Clinical monitoring for potential hepatotoxicity has been and will continue to be conducted in subsequent studies in humans. Such monitoring will include routine liver function tests including ALT, AST, total bilirubin, GGT and ALP at all study phases, including screening (before exposure to rimegepant), regularly during exposure, and after exposure. Additionally, the frequency, severity, and discontinuations of hepatic-related AEs are monitored closely. All cases of DILI are reported as SAEs. There have been no reported cases of DILI with rimegepant administration to date. Other symptoms or target organs from nonclinical studies that will continue to be followed include skeletal muscle effects, emesis, skin rash and hematology measures. We expect to complete the ongoing two-year carcinogenicity study in the fourth quarter of 2018 and receive the study report in 2019.

     Our Product Candidate BHV-3500, a CGRP Receptor Antagonist for Acute Treatment and Prevention of Migraine 
         BHV-3500 is the second compound from our CGRP receptor antagonist platform. We are developing BHV-3500 for the acute treatment and prevention of migraine, and we believe it has the potential to improve the existing standard of care based on the following benefits:


Multiple Potential Routes of DeliveryBHV-3500 may be used by nasal, subcutaneous,
inhalation or potential oral routes of administration with rapid onset of treatment effect, compared to the anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies ("mAbs") that are currently in development which have a more
cumbersome route of administration to patients in the form of intravenous or subcutaneous use. The first formulation of BHV-3500 entering the clinic is for intranasal delivery that will be assessed
for rapid onset of action in the acute treatment of migraine. 
Favorable Safety ProfileLike rimegepant, we believe BHV-3500 will have a favorable
safety and tolerability profile in the clinic, attributable to multiple properties such as its high selectivity for the CGRP receptor, low propensity to aggregate in lipids, and its expected excretion
from the body in a largely unchanged state. Unlike other small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists that show potential for liver effects at high exposures, BHV-3500 has not demonstrated any propensity
for liver abnormalities in preclinical studies to date, even at very high dose levels. Because preventative treatments involve chronic dosing on a daily basis, any potential target organ effects on
the liver could be problematic. Therefore, based on these observations from nonclinical toxicology studies, we believe that BHV-3500 may provide a substantial benefit over other agents with such
propensities. In addition, in preclinical studies of BHV-3500, no significant cardiovascular safety or systemic toxicity issues were observed, in contrast to sumatriptan, which displays dose-dependent
vasoconstriction. 
Superior Chemical AttributesBHV-3500 is a highly soluble, potent antagonist at the
human CGRP receptor. Because BHV-3500 exhibits an in vitro and in vivo efficacy profile similar to
rimegepant, we believe that BHV-3500 will also have a comprehensive (pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) and durable efficacy profile. The chemical attributes of BHV-3500 also allow for a
variety of formulations that may provide a more rapid onset of efficacy. Unlike mAbs, which are large biologic molecules, BHV-3500 is a small molecule that directly binds with high potency to the CGRP
receptor. 
Higher Value to Patients and Payors with Lower Expected Cost Compared to
BiologicsWe expect that as a small molecule, BHV-3500 will have a lower cost of goods than mAbs, which are biologics. 
Potential for Multiple IndicationsAlthough its nonclinical safety and efficacy
profile suggests BHV-3500's potential for daily administration and development for prevention of migraine, this compound also has the potential to be developed in the acute treatment of migraine.
BHV-3500 adds flexibility to our CGRP development program as a stand-alone agent for prevention therapy or a complementary/backup intranasal formulation for rapid onset of action in the acute
treatment of migraine. 

         We believe BHV-3500 has the potential to address a significant unmet need in the acute treatment of migraines in patients with both episodic and chronic migraine, as well as compete effectively with current and future migraine prevention therapies. BHV-3500 may afford multiple routes of delivery including intranasal delivery and daily oral administration for acute and preventative treatment of migraine, potential for enhanced safety profile, superior chemical attributes and a higher value to patients and payors with lower expected costs compared to large molecule biologics in current development.

     Clinical Development Plans 
         We have commenced a toxicology development program to support the submission of an investigational new drug application ("IND") to the FDA for BHV-3500. This preclinical program includes intranasal and subcutaneous dose toxicity studies. We intend to submit an IND for BHV-3500 in the first half of 2018 to permit us to commence clinical trials. We plan to conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2018 to assess safety, tolerability and PK of BHV-3500 in healthy volunteers. 



Our Glutamate Platform 

         We are developing three product candidates, trigriluzole, BHV-0223 and BHV-5000, that modulate the glutamate system via two distinct mechanisms which form the basis of our glutamate platformglutamate transporter modulators (trigriluzole and BHV-0223) and glutamate  N-methyl-D-aspartate ("NMDA") receptor antagonists (BHV-5000). 
         Glutamate is an important neurotransmitter present in over 90% of all brain synapses and is a naturally occurring molecule that nerve cells use to send signals to other cells in the central nervous system. Glutamate plays an essential role in normal brain functioning and its levels must be tightly regulated. Abnormalities in glutamate function can disrupt nerve health and communication, and in extreme cases may lead to nerve cell death. Nerve cell dysfunction and death leads to devastating diseases, including ataxia, ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders. Glutamate clearance is necessary for proper synaptic activation and to prevent neuronal damage from excessive activation of glutamate receptors. Excitatory amino-acid transporters ("EAATs"), help regulate glutamate clearance, and are responsible for most of the glutamate uptake within the brain. 
         The mechanism of action of our glutamate platform is depicted below. Glutamate must be tightly regulated once released from a pre-synaptic neuron and acts as a signaling neurotransmitter to stimulate the post-synaptic neuron via stimulation of glutamate receptors (e.g., NMDA, AMPA or Kainate receptors). Glial cells surrounding the synaptic junction are predominantly responsible for clearing glutamate through transporters, the EAATs. There are five distinct types of glutamate transporters. (1) As depicted in the glial cell to the right of the figure below, BHV-0223 and trigriluzole increase the activity of the EAATs to increase the clearance of glutamate and decrease glutamate release from the pre-synaptic neuron. Trigriluzole and BHV-0223 also inhibit presynaptic ion channels that may inhibit the release of glutamate from presynaptic neurons. (2) As depicted in the postsynaptic neuron to the bottom of the figure below, BHV-5000 blocks glutamate signaling that is mediated by post-synaptic NMDA receptors. Modulating glutamate also has the potential to be neuroprotective and increase the release of neurotrophic factors, including brain derived neurotrophic factor ("BDNF") 
 18

   which are endogenous molecules that help to support the survival of existing neurons, and encourage the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses. 
 
  Glutamate Transporter Modulation 
         Abnormal glutamate release or dysfunction of glutamate clearance can cause overstimulation of glutamate receptors which can lead to a dangerous neural injury called excitotoxicity, which has been associated with a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases. The FDA has approved anti-excitotoxicity drugs that act on the glutamatergic system by blocking NMDA receptors, such as memantine ("Namenda") for Alzheimer's disease, lamotrigine ("Lamictal") for epilepsy and bipolar disorder and riluzole ("Rilutek") for ALS. Although these drugs show the therapeutic potential of glutamate receptor antagonists in the treatment of a range of neurological diseases, many of these approved drugs have serious side effects and other drawbacks that we have attempted to solve with our development of BHV-0223 and trigriluzole. 
         We are currently developing trigriluzole as a potential FDA-approved drug treatment option for patients suffering from OCD, Alzheimer's disease and ataxia (initially focusing on SCA). A Phase 2 double-blind, randomized controlled trial on the use of trigriluzole in OCD commenced in late 2017 and enrollment is expected to complete in 2018. In addition, a Phase 2 double-blind, randomized controlled trial of trigriluzole in the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease is being advanced in collaboration with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, a consortium of sites funded by the National Institutes of Health. We expect that this trial will begin in the first half of 2018. The 48-week extension phase of the SCA Phase 2/3 trial is ongoing, and we expect to receive the data from that portion of the trial by the end of 2018. 
         OCD is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms of obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors) that can interfere with patients' functional abilities. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the 12-month prevalence of OCD is 1% of the U.S. adult population, and approximately half of these cases are characterized as severe. First-line treatment for OCD includes cognitive behavior therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ("SSRIs") and adjunctive use of atypical antipsychotics. Nonetheless, up to 60% of patients have an inadequate response to conventional intervention strategies. While SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics have been approved for OCD, the majority of patients do not have an adequate response to pharmacologic treatment, and some seek invasive neurosurgical procedures to ameliorate symptoms. Despite the significant public health burden, no novel mechanisms of action have been approved by the 
 19

   FDA for OCD in over two decades. The rationale for use of trigriluzole in OCD is supported by clinical data with its active metabolite, riluzole, in populations with OCD in open-label and placebo-controlled clinical trials as well as in preclinical, genetic and neuroimaging studies implicating the glutamatergic hyperactivity in the pathogenesis of OCD. 
         Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, characterized by symptoms of progressive memory loss and impairment in other areas of cognition. According to the Alzheimer's Association, approximately 5.5 million people in the United States are affected by the disease and, with the aging population, that number is expected to triple by 2050. We believe the rationale for the study of trigriluzole in Alzheimer's disease is supported by preclinical studies on the active metabolite, riluzole, in multiple relevant preclinical models and our own clinical data from the Phase 2/3 clinical trial on the potential of trigriluzole to overcome limitations of administering riluzole. 
         SCA represents an orphan disease. According to a 2016 report by Orphanet cataloging the prevalence and incidence of rare diseases, SCA affects approximately 22,000 individuals in the United States. We have received both orphan drug designation and fast track designation from the FDA for trigriluzole for the treatment of SCA. In October 2017, we reported topline data from the 8-week randomization period from the Phase 2/3 clinical trial in SCA. At the eight week time point, trigriluzole did not statistically differentiate from placebo. Post-hoc analyses suggested the potential for favorable therapeutic effects of trigriluzole, based on numerically superior treatment effects compared to placebo in groups of subjects with less inherent pre-randomization variability on the primary endpoint and also in those, who based on baseline characteristics, would be expected to have greater drug exposures. In the trial, we observed a favorable safety and tolerability profile. For example, no subjects demonstrated an elevation of liver transaminases of 3-fold or greater than the upper limit of normal; whereas, a similar exposure of the active metabolite, riluzole, is associated with about an 8% rate of such elevations, based on the Rilutek Prescribing Information. The 48-week extension phase of the SCA trial is ongoing, and we are continuing to assess the data from the trial. Based on post-hoc analyses we are in active dialogue with the FDA to discuss the potential for further development of trigriluzole in ataxias and the FDA has expressed willingness to accept a modification of our trial's primary endpoint, the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia ("SARA"), as an acceptable registrational endpoint. Future development of trigriluzole in ataxia will be based on these interactions and results from the extension phase of the ongoing Phase 2/3 trial. 
         In addition, preclinical and small-scale pilot studies are underway to explore trigriluzole's use in the treatment of a pipeline of other indications such as essential tremor, psychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression as well as some cancers whose spread is thought mediated by glutamate transmission, such as melanoma and glioblastoma. We are also developing analogs of trigriluzole and other related prodrugs for potential use in these indications. 
         We are currently developing BHV-0223 for the treatment of ALS. According to the ALS Association, ALS affects up to 20,000 individuals in the United States and according to industry data, we estimate 15,000 individuals are clinically diagnosed, with 7,500 ALS patients actively treated with generic riluzole or branded Rilutek. As the first of two drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of ALS and the only drug to extend life and/or time to tracheostomy, riluzole is the established standard of care. However, while the market is highly genericized, there have not been further clinical improvements or advances in ALS riluzole therapeutics since the FDA's approval in 1995. In addition, the use of riluzole is limited by a number of non-desirable attributes. We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for BHV-0223 in ALS and we have observed results suggesting bioequivalence to Rilutek in a recently completed Phase 1 clinical trial. We believe that BHV-0223, if approved, could gain meaningful market share based on its favorable formulation attributes. 
         BHV-5000 is an orally available, first-in-class, low-trapping, NMDA receptor antagonist prodrug that we are developing for the treatment of neuropsychiatric indications, including Rett syndrome. Rett 
 20

   syndrome is a rare and severe genetic neurodevelopmental disorder. After six to 18 months of apparently normal post-natal development, patients with Rett syndrome develop global deceleration of psychomotor function, loss of acquired cognitive skills and brain-mediated episodes of transient respiratory suppression. With intensive care, patients may survive into adulthood, yet they are severely physically and cognitively impaired. Rett syndrome affects approximately 15,000 individuals in the United States. No approved drug therapies for Rett syndrome are currently available and care is supportive. The rationale for the study of BHV-5000 in Rett syndrome is based on results of studies with BHV-5000, its active metabolite and ketamine in preclinical mouse models, in which improvement in key clinical features of the disease have been observed, including a reduction in the frequency of episodes of respiratory suppression. These preclinical findings are supported by anecdotal clinical reports regarding the use of ketamine, another NMDA receptor antagonist, in patients with Rett syndrome that have been reported to also show clinical improvements. 
   Our Product Candidate Trigriluzole for Ataxias, OCD and Alzheimer's Disease 
         Trigriluzole is a new chemical entity ("NCE") and tripeptide prodrug of the active metabolite, riluzole. Based on its mechanism of action, preclinical data and clinical studies, trigriluzole has potential for therapeutic benefit in a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric illnesses. Initial development has focused on its use in treating SCA, an orphan neurological indication that currently has no approved drug therapies and for which the active metabolite, riluzole, has demonstrated preliminary efficacy in two prior randomized controlled trials conducted by third parties. We acquired trigriluzole from ALS Biopharma, LLC ("ALS Biopharma"), and Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc. ("FCCDC"), along with an estate of over 300 prodrugs. A prodrug is a compound that, after administration, is metabolized in the body into an active drug. Trigriluzole is actively transported by virtue of recognition of its tripeptide moiety by the PepT1 transporter in the gut, and is responsible for the increased bioavailability of the drug. Once inside the body, the prodrug, trigriluzole is cleaved by enzymes in the blood to the active metabolite riluzole. To mitigate the limitations of riluzole, several classes of prodrugs were designed, synthesized, and evaluated in multiple  in vitro stability assays that predict in vivo drug levels. Trigriluzole is a third generation of prodrug development and the product of six years of intensive chemistry efforts. 
         Riluzole is currently only indicated for ALS and has a number of non-desirable attributes that have limited its clinical use. Key limitations of riluzole include:
 

Poor oral bioavailabilityWhen riluzole is administered in a tablet form,
approximately 40% is either not absorbed or is metabolized in the liver before reaching systemic circulation. The fraction that does not reach systemic circulation and does not contribute to efficacy
only increases the drug burden to the liver. This is thought to contribute to its negative safety effects, such as the liver effects described below. 
Only tablet formulation currently available in United StatesIt is difficult for
many patients with ALS to swallow, as oral and laryngeal dysfunction can be an early symptom of ALS. Such patients may choose to crush the tablets and mix it with food to make them easier to swallow;
however, this is thought to decrease bioavailability. 
Negative food effectRiluzole must be taken on an empty stomach, at least one hour
before or two hours after a meal, and failure to adhere to these guidelines results in lower drug levels and potentially decreased therapeutic effects. This can be particularly challenging for
late-stage ALS patients who require a feeding tube for nutrition. 
Negative effect on liverRiluzole has been shown to have dose-dependent liver
effects that include elevations on liver function tests. Taking riluzole necessitates regular laboratory monitoring of liver function. In addition, according to the FDA's warnings and precautions for 

 21

   

Rilutek
in its U.S. prescribing information, cases of clinical hepatitis, one of which has been fatal, have been reported in patients taking riluzole. 


Pharmacokinetic variabilityDue to extensive first-pass metabolism and CYP1A2
metabolism, which is heterogeneously expressed and thought to be responsible for the marked pharmacokinetic variability between individuals, riluzole has been observed to have marked pharmacokinetic
variability, an attribute that manifests as a wide range of systemic drug exposure in populations administered the same dose. 
Oral numbnessPatients have reported oral numbness associated with the active
pharmaceutical ingredient riluzole, which makes development of alternate formulations challenging. 

         The prodrug design and selected administration pathway that was pursued with trigriluzole is intended to address all of these limitations of riluzole. In addition, a prodrug can be engineered to enhance absorption and protect from diminished absorption when taken with meals. The trigriluzole preclinical development strategy was based on optimizing in vivo and in vitro features, such as stability in gastrointestinal and stomach fluids; stability in liver microsomes; favorable safety pharmacology with respect to off-target effects (particularly liver effects); metabolic cleavage in the plasma to release the active moiety; and enhanced gastrointestinal absorption properties. In in vivo studies in rodents, the intended benefits of this optimization program were observed, including delayed peak concentrations and greater exposure. 
         After six years of chemistry development and preclinical testing, the resulting lead prodrug from the chemistry program was trigriluzole. Trigriluzole is chemically comprised of riluzole linked via an amide bond to a tripeptide that is a substrate for gut transporters (PepT1) and which contributes to its improved bioavailability. The tripeptide moiety is cleaved by plasma aminopeptidases, releasing riluzole and naturally occurring amino acids, which we believe are readily managed by endogenous metabolic routes. We believe that the estate of compounds we acquired, combined with our internally developed intellectual property, will provide a significant barrier to entry from competitors. Trigriluzole is stable in fluids from the gastrointestinal tract and expected to have a differentiated profile with regard to any liability for hepatic effects. 
         SCA was chosen as the lead indication based on a strong preclinical rationale as well as demonstration of preliminary efficacy of trigriluzole's active metabolite, riluzole, in two randomized controlled trials in patients with SCA and other ataxias conducted by third parties (Ristori 2010; Romano 2015). We continue to develop trigriluzole for the treatment of ataxias, with an initial focus on SCA. 
   The Potential Benefits of Trigriluzole Compared to Riluzole 
         We believe trigriluzole offers the following potential advantages, compared to orally dosed riluzole:
 

Improved BioavailabilityTrigriluzole is a substrate for the gut transporters
(PepT1). This is thought to increase the bioavailability of the drug as compared to orally dosed riluzole, meaning that more of the compound is absorbed by the body into the blood stream and can have
an active effect. Studies have shown that administration of agents through peptide transporters significantly increases the absorption of drugs with otherwise poor oral bioavailability. 
No Negative Food EffectTrigriluzole shows no food effect in human studies, meaning
that the drug will not be associated with special meal restrictions, a phenomenon potentially attributable to enhanced uptake by intestinal transporters specific to the peptide-containing moiety of
trigriluzole. This is in contrast to oral riluzole tablets, which require a period of fasting around dosing in order to reach therapeutic levels, currently a dose-limiting factor of riluzole. 

 22



Lower Overall Drug Burden to the LiverAs a prodrug that mitigates first-pass liver
metabolism and enhances bioavailability, therapeutic concentrations of the active metabolite riluzole can be achieved with a lower drug dose as compared to riluzole tablets. In addition, release of
the active metabolite over time will result in a reduced bolus hepatic concentration as compared to that associated with riluzole tablets. Taken together, we believe these attributes of trigriluzole
will reduce the potential for adverse liver effects. 
Optimized Dosing Regimen and ComplianceTrigriluzole has been developed as a
convenient once-daily dose, which could improve regimen compliance for patients. We believe these are important features to optimize long-term health outcomes in the treatment of patients with chronic
diseases. 
Potential for Developing Multiple FormulationsTrigriluzole
is highly soluble and does not exhibit the profound oral numbness associated with riluzole tablets. As such, we believe trigriluzole has the potential to be developed in multiple formulations
including intranasal, subcutaneous, intravenous, sublingual and other forms. 

 Overview of Ataxias and Limitations of Current Treatment 
         Ataxias are a group of degenerative diseases of the nervous system, including hereditary ataxias and sporadic ataxias. According to the National Ataxia Foundation, the word "ataxia" originates from a Greek word meaning "without order" or "incoordination" and aptly describes many of the symptoms that are experienced by people who suffer from the many forms of ataxia, including problems with coordination, balance and movement which can affect a person's fingers, hands, arms, legs, body, speech and eye movements. Ataxias are generally classified as being either hereditary or sporadic. Hereditary ataxias are degenerative disorders that progress over a number of years. The hereditary ataxias include autosomal dominant forms, such as SCA, episodic ataxias and dentratorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and autosomal recessive forms, such as Friedreich's ataxia, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and ataxia-telangiectasia. Sporadic ataxias are generally idiopathic, do not run in families and have an onset later in life. Sporadic ataxias share many clinical features of the hereditary forms, which is thought to be attributable to similar underlying cerebellar dysfunction. 
         Although symptoms may vary, the typical clinical course of SCA might be described as follows. Balance and coordination are affected first. Incoordination of hands, arms, and legs, and slurring of speech are other common, early symptoms. Over time, individuals with SCA may develop numbness, tingling, or pain in the arms and legs (sensory neuropathy), uncontrolled muscle tensing (dystonia), muscle wasting (atrophy), and muscle twitches (fasciculations). Walking becomes difficult and is characterized by walking with feet placed further apart to compensate for poor balance. Impaired coordination of the arms and hands affects the ability to perform tasks requiring fine motor control such as writing and eating. Rarely, rigidity, tremors, and involuntary jerking movements (chorea) have been reported in people who have been affected for many years. As time goes on, ataxia can affect speech and swallowing. Finally, individuals with SCA may also have difficulty processing, learning, and remembering information (cognitive impairment). Notably, there can also be significant clinical variation in the order and extent of symptom expression between mutations, within a common mutation, and even within a kindred that shares the same genotype. Non-cerebellar involvement may also occur in many SCA subtypes (such as cognition, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, motor neuron, peripheral nerve or macular involvement). Signs and symptoms of SCA typically begin in early adulthood, but can appear anytime from childhood to late adulthood; SCA is degenerative and progresses over a number of years. The neurodegeneration is attributed to the production of abnormal proteins that cause the affected nerve cells, predominantly cerebellar purkinje fibers, to eventually function poorly and ultimately degenerate. As SCA progresses, coordination problems become more pronounced. Atrophy of the cerebellum and sometimes brainstem may be apparent on brain imaging. The diagnosis of SCA requires the exclusion of acquired, non-genetic causes of ataxia, such as 
 23

   alcoholism, vitamin deficiencies, multiple sclerosis, vascular disease, tumors, and paraneoplastic disease. A definitive diagnosis requires genetic testing or occurrence within a kindred that has an identified mutation. Lifespan is significantly shortened due to complications related to neurological deficits. 
         There are currently no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of SCA or any other cerebellar ataxia, and treatment is supportive. In general, multidisciplinary care provides supportive measures and the goal of this treatment is to improve quality of life and survival. 
   Our Clinical Program for Trigriluzole in Spinocerebellar Ataxia 
   Phase 1 Trials with Trigriluzole 
         In July 2016, we began a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of single and multiple ascending doses of trigriluzole in normal healthy volunteers. In this study, the initial safety and tolerability of trigriluzole at single doses ranging from 9.5 mg to 200 mg and multiple doses ranging from 35 mg to 200 mg daily were assessed. Fifty-eight healthy volunteers have been dosed with trigriluzole and 20 have been dosed with placebo. Based on preliminary data, both single and multiple doses up to 200 mg have been well tolerated without evidence of novel, clinically significant safety signals or lab abnormalities. There is no apparent dose response regarding the frequency or severity of AEs. In the blinded group, including subjects treated with both placebo and trigriluzole, the most common AEs were headache (five subjects, two with moderate severity and three with mild severity) and constipation (two subjects). No pattern of AEs or lab abnormalities has become apparent to provide specific cautions or to suggest cautions beyond what is appropriate for the active metabolite, riluzole. Preliminary results suggest approximately 25% to 30% greater systemic exposure of the active metabolite via oral administration of trigriluzole as compared to riluzole tablets. In addition, the time to peak concentration of the active metabolite via oral administration of trigriluzole was extended relative to that achieved with oral riluzole tablets, thus suggesting the mitigation of first-pass metabolism. A cross-over arm of the trial assessing fed and fasted conditions suggested no food effect. These pharmacokinetic properties differentiate from direct oral administration of the active metabolite. These preliminary safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data support advancement of trigriluzole. Commencing in December 2017, an additional single and multiple dose study was conducted to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of a 280 mg dose in 10 healthy young and elderly volunteers (8 active; 2 placebo). Preliminary results support adequate safety and tolerability and yielded mean exposures comparable to what would be expected from a 200 mg dose of Rilutek (based on extrapolation from Chandu 2010), a dose that has been safely used in clinic populations and associated with efficacy in a range of disorders in randomized controlled trials (Huntington Study Group Neurology 2003; Lacomblez Neurology 1996). In addition, a bioequivalence study was conducted to bridge a commercial formulation with a Phase 2/3 formulation in 32 healthy volunteers. The commercial formulation was well-tolerated and provided bioequivalent exposure with the Phase 2/3 formulation. Exposures from these recent Phase 1 studies are consistent with an absolute bioavailability of approximately 85% or greater, based on known absolute bioavailabilty of Rilutek of 60%. 
         Based on the results of our Phase 1 trial with trigriluzole and two third-party academic trials that have shown preliminary efficacy of riluzole in cerebellar ataxias, we advanced trigriluzole into a Phase 2/3 clinical trial for SCA. 
         The Phase 2/3 trial has two periods: an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase followed by a 48-week open-label treatment. The study is being conducted at approximately 15 sites in the United States. The design of the trial was informed predominantly by an advisory panel of the leading ataxia experts that we hosted in February 2016 as well as the observations from peer-reviewed publications in the scientific literature. 141 subjects were randomized to receive a once-daily dose of either placebo or 140 mg trigriluzole. Patients were stratified by diagnosis (genotype) and baseline severity (as measured by the patient's gait SARA score of £4 and >4). The primary outcome measure 
 24

   of the trial is the change from baseline in patient SARA score after eight weeks of treatment. The choice of the SARA, a validated scale, as the primary outcome measure was based on the consensus of a panel of national experts, based largely on the validation of the instrument in multiple populations, its effective use in demonstrating efficacy in a trial with riluzole (as shown in the Romano study discussed above), favorable psychometric properties, and its ability to assess a broad spectrum of ataxia-related symptoms. A secondary outcome measure is the patient time to perform an eight-meter walk test. Exploratory outcome measures include improvement as measured using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale Part IV on functional assessment, Clinical Global Impression of Improvement and the Patient Global Impression of Change. Qualifying subjects have genotypically confirmed diagnosis of the most common SCA subtypes. They must have moderate symptom severity (i.e., SARA scores of 8 to 30 inclusive and be able to walk eight meters without assistance). Almost all subjects who completed the eight-week treatment phase elected to participate in the 48-week open-label extension phase. 
         We reported topline data from the 8-week randomization period from the Phase 2/3 clinical trial in SCA. At the eight week time point, trigriluzole did not statistically differentiate from placebo. After eight weeks of treatment, trigriluzole treated subjects demonstrated an improvement of 0.81 points [95% CI: 1.4 to 0.2] on the SARA versus 1.05 points [95% CI: 1.6 to 0.4] improvement in placebo, p-value = 0.52. Placebo response in this genetically defined disorder was higher than expected based upon prior European randomized controlled trials in SCA (Romano et al 2015; Ristori et al 2010). Post-hoc analyses suggested the potential for favorable therapeutic effects of trigriluzole, based on numerically superior treatment effects compared to placebo in groups of subjects with less inherent pre-randomization variability on the primary endpoint and also in those, who based on baseline characteristics, would be expected to have greater drug exposures. 
         In this trial, we observed a favorable safety and tolerability profile of trigriluzole, with no drug-related SAEs and low discontinuation rates due to AEs. No randomized subjects demonstrated an elevation of liver transaminases of three-fold or greater than the upper limit of normal; whereas, a similar exposure of the active metabolite, riluzole, is associated with about an 8% rate of such elevations. We believe that the reduced effects on the liver may be attributable to a higher bioavailability that in part reflects mitigated first-pass liver metabolism and enhanced PepT1-mediated absorption. Trigriluzole has shown absence of a negative food effect, optimized oral bioavailability and no pattern of clinically significant effects on liver function, presenting a profile that appears distinct from what is described for riluzole in its U.S. prescribing information. This profile, in context of recent Phase 1 data assessing higher doses, will allow for exploration of higher exposures of the active metabolite than allowed by the current Rilutek label. 
         Post-hoc analyses of the data have led to our continued interest in developing trigriluzole in SCA and is also founded on two academic randomized controlled trials studying the active metabolite or trigriluzole in diverse populations with cerebellar ataxia. In these two publications, the authors conducted studies of riluzole compared to placebo to assess improvement in patients with ataxias using two different ataxia rating scales. In each study, the authors observed statistically significant improvements in the riluzole treatment groups compared to the placebo groups. 
 

 Ristori et al 2010 demonstrated statistically significant improvement in patients with a variety of cerebellar ataxias: In a
paper published in Neurology in 2010, Ristori and colleagues reported results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
of patients presenting with cerebellar ataxias of diverse etiologies. Forty subjects were randomized to receive eight weeks of treatment with either placebo or 100 mg riluzole (50 mg riluzole tablets,
dosed twice daily). The primary endpoint of the trial was the proportion of patients with a decrease of at least 5 points in the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) after four and
eight weeks of treatment, compared with the baseline score. The ICARS quantifies severity of ataxia-related symptoms on a scale of zero to 100, with a higher score indicating greater impairment. The
total score is the sum of four subscores which measure a patient's posture and gait (static subscore), 

 25

   

limb
coordination (kinetic subscore), speech (dysarthria subscore) and oculomotor function (ocular movement subscore). The number of patients with a five-point ICARS drop (the primary outcome measure)
was significantly higher in the riluzole treatment group than in the placebo group after four weeks (9 out of 19 versus 1 out of 19; p-value = 0.003) and at eight weeks (13 out of 19
versus 1 out of 19; p-value = 0.001). The patient group treated with riluzole demonstrated superior mean changes on the ICARS scores over eight weeks of treatment as compared to the placebo
group (7.05 versus 0.16; p-value < 0.001). The table below shows the changes in ICARS from baseline in each treatment group after eight weeks of treatment, as well as
the change in each subscore category. Only sporadic, mild AEs were reported in the trial. Results from this study suggest that riluzole, which is the active metabolite of trigriluzole, may confer
acute therapeutic effects after eight weeks of dosing in diverse forms of cerebellar ataxia. 





 Romano et al 2015 demonstrated statistically significant improvement in patients with hereditary cerebellar ataxia (both SCA and
Friedreich's ataxia): In an article published in The Lancet in 2015, Romano and colleagues described results of a study on the use of
riluzole in patients with hereditary cerebellar ataxias over a 12-month period. In this multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, sixty subjects diagnosed with either SCA or Friedreich's
ataxia (enrolled in a 2:1 ratio) were randomized to receive 12 months of treatment with either placebo or 100 mg riluzole (50 mg tablets of riluzole, twice daily). The primary endpoint was the
proportion of patients with a minimum one-point improvement on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) after 12 months. The SARA is a validated scale consisting of an
eight-item, semi-quantitative performance-based assessment of cerebellar ataxia symptoms that measures impairment on a scale of zero to 40, with a higher score indicating more severe ataxia. This
scale was developed to address limitations of the ICARS and has been broadly adopted over the ICARS based on superior practicability, reliability and psychometric properties. Twenty-eight patients
were treated with riluzole (19 with SA and 9 with Friedreich's ataxia) and 27 patients were in the placebo group (19 with SA and 8 with Friedreich's ataxia). The proportion of patients
in the riluzole treatment group with a decreased SARA score was 14 (50%) versus three (11%) in the placebo group (p-value = 0.002). No severe AEs were reported. Primary and secondary outcome
measures are shown in the table below. Mean changes in the SARA scores were reported at three and 12 months of treatment, with riluzole associated with reductions in SARA ratings (1.00 and 1.02
points improvement, respectively) and placebo associated with increases (0.50 and 1.67 points, respectively) and resulting in differences between treatment groups that were statistically significant
(p-values of 0.008 and 0.001, respectively). Results from 

 26

   

this
study suggest the potential efficacy of riluzole, which is the active metabolite of trigriluzole, in the treatment of cerebellar ataxia. 





         The 48-week extension phase of the SCA trial is ongoing and we are continuing to assess the data from the trial. 
   Development and Regulatory Pathway 
         Our clinical program for trigriluzole is based on a regulatory pathway under section 505(b)(2) of the U.S. Food Drug and Cosmetic Act that allows reference to data on riluzole for the purpose of safety assessments. In addition, under current FDA interpretations, we believe trigriluzole also qualifies as an NCE and thereby is eligible for conventional regulatory data exclusivities. 
         We are in active dialogue with the FDA to discuss the potential for further development of trigriluzole in ataxias and the FDA has expressed willingness to accept a modification of our study's primary endpoint, the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, also called SARA, as an acceptable registrational endpoint. Future directions in ataxia will be based on this interaction and results from the extension phase of the ongoing study. 
         In the fourth quarter 2017, we completed a study demonstrating the bioequivalence of a commercial formulation of 140 mg trigriluzole with the Phase 2/3 formulation that is being used in ongoing studies. An additional Phase 1 study has been conducted to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of higher doses of trigriluzole (280 mg daily) in healthy young and elderly adults. We believe the preliminary results suggest an acceptable safety and tolerability profile of this dose and support its exploration in clinical populations. 
   Overview of Trigriluzole in OCD 
         OCD is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms of obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors) that can interfere with patients' functional abilities. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the 12-month prevalence of OCD is 1% of the U.S. adult population, and approximately half of these cases are characterized as severe. First-line treatment for OCD includes cognitive behavior therapy, SSRIs and adjunctive use of atypical antipsychotics. Nonetheless, up to 60% of patients have an inadequate response to conventional intervention strategies. While SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics have been approved for OCD, the majority of patients do not have an adequate response to pharmacologic treatment, and some seek invasive neurosurgical procedures to ameliorate symptoms. Despite the significant public health burden, no novel mechanisms of action have been approved by the FDA for OCD in over two decades. 
         In multiple case studies, the use of riluzole in patients with refractory OCD has commonly been associated with meaningful improvement of symptoms. A small-scale randomized controlled trial in 
 27

   adults with OCD conducted by a third party showed favorable trends for the use of riluzole in outpatient settings but not in inpatient settings, a difference possibly attributed to the intensive therapeutic interactions often available in an inpatient setting. Another randomized controlled third-party study in refractory OCD failed to demonstrate the efficacy of the adjunctive use of riluzole in 60 pediatric patients with refractory OCD. A third randomized controlled third party trial demonstrated statistically significant therapeutic effects with the adjunctive use of riluzole as compared to adjunctive placebo in 50 adults with refractory OCD. These clinical effects are consistent with findings such as genetic associations of glutamate transporter genes with OCD and increased glutamate concentrations in brain and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with OCD. Taken together, we believe there is a clear rationale for advancement of trigriluzole or another optimized prodrug of riluzole from our pipeline into a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in OCD. 
         A Phase 2/3 double-blind, randomized controlled trial on the use of trigriluzole in adults with OCD commenced in late 2017 and, based on learnings from the Phase 2/3 trial in SCA, employs a higher target dose (200 mg daily) than the study in SCA. Enrollment is expected to complete in 2018. If the results are favorable, we anticipate beginning additional studies necessary to support a NDA. 
   Overview of Trigriluzole in Alzheimer's Disease 
         Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative dementia. It accounts for up to 80% of dementias. According to the Alzheimer's Association, in 2016 there were approximately 5.5 million people in the United States with the disease, and that number is expected to escalate rapidly in the coming years as the population ages. Observations in multiple preclinical models, suggests the active metabolite of trigriluzole protects from Alzheimer's-related pathology and cognitive dysfunction. Reduced glutamate uptake transporters have been reported in postmortem brain tissue of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and the level of glutamate transporter reduction correlates with cognitive impairment as well as markers of synaptic density and neurodegeneration. Preclinical studies also suggest that age-related memory impairment in rats correlates with decreased glutamate transporter expression and this impairment has been shown to be restored by three-weeks of daily treatment with trigriluzole's active drug metabolite. These findings form our rationale for pursuing a Phase 2, proof-of-concept trial of trigriluzole in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, which we anticipate beginning in the first half of 2018 in collaboration with the Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study ("ADCS"). 
         The ADCS is a leading Alzheimer's disease clinical trials research consortium that receives major support from the U.S. National Institute on Aging, a part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The ADCS was developed to promote the discovery, development, and testing of new drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. 
   Overview of Trigriluzole in Other Indications 
         Given the novel chemical properties of trigriluzole and its unique mechanism of action, we believe trigriluzole, or another optimized prodrug of riluzole, has the potential for broad applicability across several neurological indications where modulation of brain glutamate has been implicated in underlying disease states. A brief description of potential indications that we could pursue in the future with trigriluzole or other optimized prodrugs from our pipeline is summarized below. We will determine the timing and prioritization of additional indications as warranted by emerging data. 



Other Orphan Indications 

         If data from the ongoing extension phase of the SCA trial support the role of trigriluzole in the treatment of SCA, then we will explore the role trigriluzole in the treatment of other ataxias. Of note, preliminary data is also provided by the Ristori and Romano randomized controlled trials, which 
 28

   showed improvement in some patients with Friedreich's ataxia, multisystem atrophy of the cerebellar type, sporadic ataxia, antibody-associated ataxia and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. We expect that the next wave of ataxia indications we would pursue, if warranted by data from the SCA trial, would include Friedreich's ataxia and sporadic ataxia. 
 

 Friedreich's Ataxia:  Friedreich's ataxia is an
autosomal recessive disorder associated with progressive cerebellar degeneration with worsening ataxia, areflexia, which is the absence of reflexes, sensory loss, weakness, glucose dysregulation, and
cardiomyopathyoften with onset in early childhood. According to the Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance, an estimated 6,400 individuals in the United States have Friedreich's ataxia.
Treatment is supportive and no pharmacotherapies are approved by the FDA for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia. 
 Sporadic Ataxia:  Sporadic ataxia, also called
idiopathic ataxia, shares symptoms of SCA but is associated with an unknown cause, typically presenting after the age of 40 years and commonly associated with cerebellar degeneration. Sporadic
ataxia comprises the majority of patients treated in specialty ataxia clinics. These patients typically have progressive balance difficulties with other features of cerebellar disease such as
dysarthria (speech problems), dysphagia (swallowing difficulty), as well as visual symptoms such as double vision. According to Orphanet, the prevalence of sporadic ataxia is between 1 and 9 per
100,000 persons, suggesting that there are between 3,200 and 28,000 individuals with sporadic ataxia in the United States. 




Other (Non-Orphan) Cerebellar Disorders 

 Essential Tremor:  Like SCA, the
pathophysiology of essential tremor ("ET") reflects underlying cerebellar dysfunction. ET is the most common type of tremor, characterized by action and postural tremor in the upper extremities and/or
head and voice tremor. The prevalence of ET is approximately four times that of the second most common tremor disorder, Parkinson's disease. ET can be highly disabling, as many ET patients cannot
write, type, drink, or feed themselves due to tremor. ET is a progressive disease and with time, the tremor becomes more severe and disabling. Currently, only two medications, primidone and
propranolol, are commonly employed as first-line symptomatic treatment of ET, but these are ineffective in 40% of ET patients and none of the available medications are FDA-approved for ET. Therefore,
a novel symptomatic therapy for ET could serve an important unmet medical need for a substantial population. Preclinical studies with trigriluzole in mouse genetic and toxicity models of ataxia have
shown reductions in tremor. Supported by this data, we are developing a Phase 2 study of trigriluzole in subjects with ET in collaboration with the Tremor Research Group, a national,
independent, non-profit organization of scientific investigators. 




Broader Neuropsychiatric Indications 

         Based upon preclinical and preliminary clinical work, we also believe there are several potential expansions for trigriluzole, or another optimized prodrug of riluzole from our pipeline, including potential for therapeutic application in a broad range of neuropsychiatric conditions, such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders and neurodegenerative disorders. 
 


Anxiety Disorders 

 Generalized Anxiety Disorder:  Generalized anxiety disorder ("GAD") is a
neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by chronic or excessive worry, restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, or insomnia to such a degree that it causes diminished social or occupational
functioning. Somatic symptoms such as irritable bowel-like gastrointestinal complaints are common. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, GAD affects 6.8 million
adults, or 3.1% of the U.S. population. According to the National Institute of Mental 

 29

   

Health,
only 43.7% of these patients receiving treatment are receiving minimally adequate treatment, which equates to only 18.9% of those with the disorder. Current first-line treatments include
SSRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine and venlafaxine), benzodiazepines and combinations thereof. Nonetheless, approximately half of patients do not respond adequately to
these therapies and many patients are not amenable to treatment with these agents (e.g., due to tolerability or predisposition to substance abuse). GAD has significant societal and economic
impact. For example, it is the most common contributor to workplace disability. In addition, patients with GAD utilize high levels of medical services; in addition to visiting psychiatrists to
directly manage symptoms of GAD, patients visit internists and specialty clinicians to evaluate somatic complaints that range from
headaches to fatigue to gastrointestinal distress. Our rationale for potentially advancing trigriluzole into a Phase 2 trial in GAD in the future is based on treatment effect in preclinical
models of anxiety as well as favorable open-label case studies of patients treated with riluzole. In one case study, eight of 15 patients demonstrated a remission with a median response time of
2.5 weeks after starting riluzole 50 mg twice daily. 


 Social Anxiety Disorder:  Social anxiety disorder ("SAD"), is a marked and
persistent fear of social situations, causing impairment and distress, which can impair school, work and social functioning. SAD affects approximately 12% of Americans. Roughly one-third to one-half
of patients with SAD do not experience significant clinical benefit from current treatments, including SSRIs. Several uncontrolled trials have suggested the efficacy of glutamate modulating agents for
reducing anxiety symptoms in adults with other anxiety disorders, such as GAD and OCD, as well as major depression. We are collaborating with researchers at Yale University to explore the use of our
glutamate modulating agents in the treatment of SAD. 




Mood Disorders 

 Bipolar Depression:  Bipolar disorder is a chronic disorder associated with
periods of depressive or manic moods that often severely affect overall functioning. The limited available treatment options include conventional antidepressants, but they are associated with
increased cycling between manic and depressed phases. Approved agents for bipolar depression (atypical antipsychotics) are associated with weight gain, sedation and safety issues. According to the
National Institute of Mental Health, bipolar disorder affects approximately 5.7 million Americans, or about 2.6% of the U.S. population, every year. As many as one in five patients with bipolar
disorder commits suicide. The rationale for assessing trigriluzole in treating bipolar depression derives from multiple third-party publications on the use of riluzole. In one study of 14 patients
with bipolar depression, improvement was observed after treatment with riluzole (and within a subset of four patients that were resistant to lamotrigine, three remitted or partially responded).
Another third-party study observed positive effects in 14 largely treatment-resistant patients after six weeks of treatment with 100-200 mg per day of riluzole. In this study, early changes observed
on magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which measures patients' brain glutamate levels, correlated with clinical improvement. 




Other Indications Being Pursued by our Collaborators 

         Our collaborators are exploring the potential applicability of trigriluzole beyond cerebellar and neuropsychiatric indications, including in melanoma (Rutgers University) and glioblastoma (Johns Hopkins University). The oncology collaborations with Rutgers and Johns Hopkins are based upon the mechanistic rationale that some tumors overexpress glutamate receptors, the central role that glutamate may have in cancer metabolism and the effect of glutamate on the tumor microenvironment. Trigriluzole is currently being assessed in a Phase 1 study (NCT03229278) to evaluate the safety in 
 30

   combination with nivolumab and pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic or unresectable cancer (including melanoma). The study is being conducted at Rutgers University. 
   Our Product Candidate BHV-0223 for ALS 
   Overview of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Limitations of Current Treatments 
         ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative motor neuron disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. The disease belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases, which are characterized by the gradual degeneration and death of motor neurons. ALS affects up to 20,000 individuals in the United States and typically presents in patients with painless muscle weakness, trouble swallowing and muscle atrophy that ultimately progresses to paralysis, impaired breathing and death. 
         Since the FDA's approval of riluzole in 1995, only two agents have been approved by the FDA in ALS drug therapeutics and riluzole is the only agent indicated to enhance survival and/or time to tracheostomy. Several therapies are currently in clinical trials. Riluzole itself has pharmacokinetic and pharmaceutic limitations that have restricted its broader clinical application. Riluzole tablets have 60% bioavailability, attributed to high first-pass metabolism in the liver that is thought to be mediated via metabolism by the heterogeneously expressed CYP1A2 enzyme. This metabolic route is also thought to contribute to the high pharmacokinetic variability associated with riluzole. In addition, riluzole is associated with reduced exposure when taken with meals, or a negative food effect, resulting in the guidance to take riluzole within a period of fasting (one hour before or two hours after a meal) for each of two daily doses. In addition, riluzole has dose-dependent effects on liver function tests that necessitate periodic liver function test monitoring and is associated with transient liver transaminase elevations. At riluzole daily doses of 100 mg, drug discontinuation is required in 2% to 4% of subjects. However, this has not been observed with lower doses, an important observation as the planned commercial dose of BHV-0223 represents a lower drug load than the FDA-approved dose of riluzole while delivering similar exposures. The drug substance of riluzole itself has other intrinsic limitations that complicate the ability to produce non-tablet formulations, including very low solubility in water, poor oral palatability, pH dependent chemical stability and intense oral numbness if administered directly to the oral mucosa. 
   Our Clinical Program for BHV-0223 in ALS 
         BHV-0223 is a formulation of riluzole designed to advance beyond the limitations of riluzole tablets for application in ALS. BHV-0223 is a sublingual ODT of riluzole, that makes use of proprietary Zydis ODT technology that we have licensed from Catalent for use with riluzole. Catalent's ODT technology allows us to develop a form of riluzole that is fast-dissolving and which we expect will mitigate many of the shortcomings associated with the solid oral dosage form of riluzole. Based on over 20 years of global clinical experience with riluzole, we expect that BHV-0223 is likely to be well tolerated in chronic dosing. To date, Biohaven has conducted two Phase 1 trials of BHV-0223 in healthy volunteers. 
         We believe BHV-0223 offers the following potential advantages, compared to the solid oral dosage form of riluzole, in the treatment of ALS:
 

Ease of AdministrationAn early symptom in many patients with ALS is difficulty
swallowing, which makes it especially challenging for ALS patients to swallow traditional riluzole tablets. In contrast, using our licensed ODT technology, ALS patients will benefit from a
fast-dissolving tablet that does not require swallowing or administration of liquids. 
More Predictable Pharmacokinetic PerformanceBecause some ALS patients experience
difficulty swallowing, they often crush their solid riluzole tablets and take with food in order to 

 31

   

ease
administration, which, in addition to resulting in mucosal numbness, leads to uncertain pharmacokinetic performance as riluzole is supposed to be administered on an empty stomach. With BHV-0223,
ALS patients will not have to crush or alter the form of administration, leading to more predictable pharmacokinetic performance. In our Phase 1 trials, we have observed that BHV-0223 is
associated with less pharmacokinetic variability than 50 mg riluzole. 


Lack of Food Effect on Overall Exposure (as assessed by AUC)Prescribing
instructions for riluzole tablets state that it should be taken at least an hour before, or two hours after, a meal to avoid food-related decreases in bioavailability. Patients who do not strictly
adhere to these fasting requirements or administer crushed riluzole in food may not be obtaining desired therapeutic levels of riluzole. BHV-0223 was designed to readily be absorbed sublingually and
directly enter the blood stream without passing through the intestines. Since absorption of BHV-0223 occurs through the vasculature under the tongue, we do not anticipate fasting requirements. We
believe this attribute will be particularly beneficial for late-stage ALS patients who require a continuous feeding tube for nutrition. Topline results from a food effect assessment with a
Phase 1 study, demonstrated bioequivalent exposure (i.e., overall exposures as measured by AUC) for BHV-0223 40 mg when administered under fed or fasted states. Cmax
concentrations under fed and fasted conditions differed, as is commonly observed with sublingual formulations; however, it is generally thought that efficacy of riluzole is driven by overall extent of
exposure (AUC). 
Reduced Drug Load and Liver ExposureRiluzole is associated with dose-dependent
liver function increases attributable to high dose loads and extensive liver metabolism. Since BHV-0223 is sublingually absorbed, first-pass liver metabolism is mitigated and lower doses of riluzole
are needed to be administered, thereby reducing potential risk for hepatic enzyme elevations. 

         BHV-0223 has been dosed in approximately 150 healthy subjects in Phase 1 studies and is currently being assessed in patients with ALS for safety and tolerability. AEs have generally been mild and transient; no treatment-related SAEs have been observed. In January 2018, we announced topline results of a bioequivalence study. Topline results confirmed that sublingual BHV-0223 (40 mg) achieves bioequivalent exposures relative to Rilutek (50 mg). In the study, 138 healthy volunteers were administered BHV-0223 and Rilutek under fasted conditions. In the pre-specified primary analysis, BHV-0223 achieved area-under-the-curve and peak exposures of approximately 90% and 113%, respectively, compared to those generated by generic riluzole. The 90% confidence intervals were within the 80% to 125% range that is used to define bioequivalence. In this study, 67 of these 138 subjects were also assessed after being administered BHV-0223 (40mg) under fed conditions. Topline results from a food effect assessment with a Phase 1 study, demonstrated bioequivalent AUC exposures for BHV-0223 40 mg when administered under fed or fasted states. Cmax concentrations under fed and fasted conditions differed, as is commonly observed with sublingual formulations; however, it is generally thought that efficacy of riluzole is driven by overall extent of exposure (AUC). In addition, we commenced a study in January 2018 assessing tolerability in dysphagic patients with ALS and will also start a tolerability study with two-month dosing in ALS patients in the first quarter 2018. 
 


Development and Regulatory Pathway 

         In December 2016, the FDA granted orphan drug designation of BHV-0223 for the treatment of ALS, with eligibility for orphan exclusivity contingent on a showing that BHV-0223 is clinically superior to Rilutek, a previously approved form of riluzole, as well as any other versions of riluzole that may be approved for the same indication before BHV-0223 is approved. Clinical superiority may be demonstrated by showing that a drug has greater effectiveness than the approved drug, greater safety in a substantial portion of the target population, or otherwise makes a major contribution to patient care. 
 32

           Within the first quarter of this year, Biohaven will have a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA and subsequently plans to submit a NDA to the FDA to pursue the regulatory approval of BHV-0223 for ALS under Section 505(b)(2) of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the second half of 2018. 
   Glutamate NMDA Receptor Antagonism 
         An NMDA receptor antagonist is a type of glutamate antagonist that works to inhibit the action of NMDA receptors which may play a role in degenerative diseases that affect the brain. BHV-5000 is an oral prodrug of the intravenous drug lanicemine, also referred to as BHV-5500, both of which we in-licensed from AstraZeneca AB ("AstraZeneca"). In addition to being orally available, BHV-5000 is a first-in-class, low-trapping, NMDA receptor antagonist with differentiating pharmacologic properties from other agents in development targeting this receptor. The unique property of low-trapping antagonists is their ability to uncouple from the NMDA receptor more freely than other agents, a property that is thought to contribute to their mitigated risk of dissociative effects as has been observed in the clinic. Lanicemine, the active metabolite of BHV-5000, binds within the NMDA channel pore and functionally blocks the flow of charged ions through the NMDA receptor complex. Lanicemine was initially advanced by AstraZeneca into clinical trials for the potential treatment of stroke, but this development was discontinued as initial results did not warrant continued development for this indication. We are developing BHV-5000 as a potential best-in-class NMDA receptor antagonist for treatment of neuropsychiatric indications. 
 Our Product Candidate BHV-5000 for Rett Syndrome 
   Overview of Rett Syndrome and Limitations of Current Treatments 
         Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from an X-linked dominant gene mutation (MECP2). As a result, it occurs almost exclusively in females. After six to 18 months of apparently normal development, patients with Rett syndrome show global deceleration of psychomotor development and subsequent loss of acquired cognitive and motor skills, such as the loss of speech. Patients may also develop pathognomonic stereotyped hand movement or display autonomic dysfunction such as breathing irregularities, including brain-mediated episodes of transient respiratory suppression, or apneic periods. With intensive care, patients may survive into adulthood, yet they are severely physically and cognitively impaired. Rett syndrome occurs in all racial and ethnic groups and occurs worldwide in approximately 1 in every 10,000 live female births. There are approximately 15,000 females with Rett syndrome in the United States. No approved treatments for Rett syndrome are currently available and care is supportive. 
 Our Clinical Program for BHV-5000 in Rett Syndrome 
         BHV-5000 and lanicemine have been observed to ameliorate the phenotype in transgenic mouse models of Rett syndrome, models which recapitulate key clinical features, such as irregular breathing, apneic periods, abnormal EEG with altered seizure threshold. Based on the preclinical experience, we have chosen to advance BHV-5000 into clinical trials for the treatment of breathing irregularities associated with Rett syndrome. The orally bioavailable prodrug BHV-5000, which was developed as an advancement on the intravenously administered lanicemine, offers an improved route of administration over lanicemine, and has thus been positioned as the lead candidate in this series. After ingestion, BHV-5000 is rapidly cleaved by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), yielding the active metabolite lanicemine. AstraZeneca studied BHV-5000 in a Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose trial. Doses up to 95 mg of BHV-5000 were studied and were observed to be well tolerated without any clinically relevant safety issues. Among the AEs reported were three cases of euphoria, three cases of hallucination, or visual distortion, and eight cases of nystagmus, a visual condition. These AEs are 
 33

   consistent with NMDA receptor antagonism. After oral ingestion, systemic concentrations of BHV-5000 were observed to be very low, typically below the limit of quantification. 
   Preclinical Studies and Previous Clinical Trials with Lanicemine and BHV-5000 
         As noted above, BHV-5000 and lanicemine have been observed to ameliorate the phenotype in transgenic mouse models of Rett syndrome. In particular, BHV-5000 has been observed to reduce the number of apneic episodes that are driven by dysfunctions in the central nervous system. These preclinical findings are consistent with those reported for the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, and have been observed at concentrations that have been well tolerated by healthy volunteers in clinical trials. The potential relevance of the preclinical models with this mechanism of action are supported by anecdotal reports on the incidental use of ketamine in patients with Rett syndrome that have been associated with clinical improvements. 
         The figure below shows results from a preclinical study with BHV-5000 in a transgenic mouse model. Transgenic (heterozygous for MECP2 mutation) and wild-type mice were administered a single dose of saline or BHV-5000 followed by measurement of apneic episodes. Acute administration of BHV-5000 was associated with a marked reduction in the number of apneic episodes. 
 
        Lanicemine has been administered to approximately 770 subjects in single or multiple doses in 18 clinical trials conducted by AstraZeneca and has been observed to be generally well tolerated. In clinical experience with lanicemine, the most common adverse event was dizziness. CNS-type AEs from Phase 1 trials also included headache, somnolence, asthenia, impaired concentration and dysesthesias. In one study, formal assessment of cognitive function in healthy volunteers revealed improvement in some components of memory, decreased vigilance and decreased calmness. Hypotension and hypertension have been reported as AEs, with low mean increases in blood pressure reported in some studies (e.g., 4 - 8 mmHg supine systolic blood pressure; 2 - 4 mmHg supine diastolic blood pressurewhich occurred at doses higher than considered necessary for therapeutic effects). AEs related to dissociation were infrequent but more common in the lanicemine group compared to placebo. AEs potentially associated with abuse potential were low but more common in the lanicemine group than the placebo group. No pattern of clinically meaningful differences between lanicemine and placebo were noted on physical exam, clinical laboratory test results or ECG results. 
         Approximately 40 healthy volunteers have been dosed with single or multiple doses of BHV-5000 in clinical trials conducted by AstraZeneca, and it was observed to be well tolerated without any clinically relevant safety issues. We believe BHV-5000 has no pharmacologic activity of its own and is rapidly metabolized to lanicemine in humans. After oral ingestion, systemic concentrations of BHV-5000 are very low, typically below the limit of quantification. 
 34

     Nonclinical Toxicology Experience with Lanicemine and BHV-5000 
         In nonclinical studies, the major dose limiting effects in both rats and dogs were central nervous system effects, which appeared rapidly and included ataxia, head weaving, depressed activity, and, at very high doses, convulsions. At pharmacologically effective doses, lanicemine did not elicit adverse effects on learning, memory or attention. Small increases in heart rate and blood pressure at very high doses were observed. In the rat with daily dosing, effects on adrenal gland, heart tissue, thyroid and kidney were apparent at very high dosesmore than 10-fold the proposed maximum clinical exposure. These effects were not seen in dogs and intermittent dosing in the rat was not associated with effects on the kidney or heart. At very high doses, evidence of neuron degeneration was apparent in very few neurons, a finding that is associated with glutamate antagonists. Based on these preclinical findings, which were consistent with other NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, lanicemine was advanced into clinical trials. Toxicology studies with BHV-5000, up to 2 weeks in rats and dogs, revealed findings consistent with lanicemine, which was expected given the negligible concentrations of BHV-5000 as compared to the active metabolite, lanicemine. A GLP neurotoxicology study is ongoing, as required for this class of agent, in order to confirm maximum acceptable therapeutic exposures in clinic populations. 
 Clinical Development of BHV-5000 
         In July 2017, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for BHV-5000 for the treatment of patients with Rett syndrome. Our clinical program for BHV-5000 will build upon AstraZeneca's previous development efforts for lanicemine. In support, BHV-5000 is rapidly metabolized to lanicemine and, in a Phase 1 trial, concentrations of BHV-5000 were detectable in only a few subjects who received the highest dose. As a result, we intend to rely on long-term Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP") toxicology, reproductive toxicology and carcinogenicity studies of lanicemine to potentially expedite the safety package for BHV-5000. 
         A lead formulation has been selected for advancing into a Phase 1 clinical trial of BHV-5000, to bridge PK with a prior formulation. Enrollment in this study commenced in the fourth quarter of 2017, with the first patient dosed in January 2018. All 10 subjects have been enrolled in a combined single and multiple dose trial (8 active; 2 placebo) and completed study participation. From preliminary results on blinded data, administration was observed to be well tolerated with no clinically relevant safety signals. These results are consistent with prior experience. That is, prior formulations of BHV-5000 had been dosed in approximately 40 healthy subjects in a Phase 1 trial conducted by AstraZeneca, and was observed to be well tolerated with no clinically relevant safety signals. Its active metabolite, lanicemine, has been administered intravenously in clinical trials conducted by AstraZeneca to approximately 770 subjects, in single or multiple doses, and has been observed to be generally well tolerated with most AEs being mild and transient in nature. 
         After completing the ongoing Phase 1 study, we plan to commence a randomized controlled trial of BHV-5000 with the potential for positive results to provide pivotal registration evidence of efficacy. One of our planned indications for BHV-5000 is Rett syndrome, based on the ability of BHV-5000 and its active metabolite to favorably impact breathing abnormalities and global brain biochemical abnormalities in transgenic mouse models. The Phase 2/3 trial is being developed in collaboration with experts in the field. The current aim is to enroll approximately 120 patients, and the patients will be randomly assigned to up to 24 weeks of treatment of either placebo or BHV-5000. The primary outcome measure is under consideration with experts and may include a behavioral outcome scale and potentially reduction in respiratory abnormalities (number of apneic episodes). Discussion of outcome measures will be a focus of regulatory interactions with the FDA. 
 35

          
  Overview of BHV-5000 in Other Indications 
         We believe that modulation of NMDA receptor activity has the potential for broad applicability across a number of CNS disorders. Our goal is to rapidly advance BHV-5000 into the clinic to assess for efficacy in neuropsychiatric indications with high unmet medical needs. Potential other conditions include depression, neuropathic pain and other disorders involving NMDA receptor dysfunction. 
 


Major Depressive Disorder 

         Major depressive disorder ("MDD") is the leading cause of disability worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. In the United States, the prevalence rate is approximately 7%. Despite the approval of over two dozen agents, therapeutic effects are limited. More than one-third of patients who complete an initial course of antidepressant treatment will not achieve a satisfactory response, and as many as 20% of patients have chronic depression despite multiple interventions. The only class of agents approved for this population of inadequate responders (also deemed treatment resistant depression) is atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g., aripiprazole, quetiapine, olanzapine-fluoxetine combination and brexpiprazole), agents associated with significant short-term and long-term side effect burdens (sedation, metabolic syndrome, obesity, extrapyramidal side effects that can include akathisia and elevated risk of tardive dyskinesia). Other agents in clinical stages of development for major depressive disorder include rapastinel (Allergan, in Phase 2 testing), esketamine (Johnson & Johnson, in Phase 3 testing), and ALKS-5461 (a combined formulation of buprenorphine and samidorphin developed by Alkermes, which has reported positive Phase 3 data). 
         Clinical findings of antidepressant effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine have provided a link between the NMDA receptor function and depression and a rationale for testing BHV-5000 as an antidepressant. In nonclinical studies, BHV-5000's active metabolite is active in models of depression and anxiety. These data prompted a line of investigation with lanicemine that included four randomized controlled trials conducted by AstraZeneca in patients with treatment resistant depression, overall suggesting an adequate safety and tolerability profile and potential for therapeutic benefit. However, the clinical data to date has not established clear efficacy and additional trials are needed. 
 


Neuropathic Pain 

         Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition caused by dysfunctional or damaged nerves. Neuropathic pain can be a debilitating and common problem affecting approximately 10% of adults in the United States. Despite the availability of multiple approved drugs, including Lyrica, and guidelines for the treatment of neuropathic pain, treatment of this condition remains a major therapeutic challenge. Existing analgesics are often ineffective, can cause serious side effects and have abuse potential that limits widespread use. Increased NMDA receptor activity is known to contribute to central sensitization in neuropathic pain. NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to reduce hyperalgesia and pain in animal models of neuropathic pain induced by nerve injury and diabetic neuropathy. Clinically used NMDA receptor antagonists, including ketamine and dextromethorphan, can be effective in patients suffering from neuropathic pain syndromes. The clinical use of robust NMDA antagonists, such as ketamine, is limited due to dissociative, psychotomimetic and abuse potential properties. Novel NMDA receptor antagonists, such as BHV-5000, that are not associated with the psychotomimetic effects and abuse potential could lead to better management of neuropathic pain without causing serious side effects. 
   Kleo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
         From August 2016 through January 2018, we made several investments to acquire a minority equity interest in Kleo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Kleo") a privately held, development-stage company founded 
 36

   by a professor of chemistry and pharmacology at Yale University that is developing small molecule immunotherapies that emulate biologics to fight cancers and infectious diseases. We have also entered into a consulting agreement with Kleo to assist Kleo with clinical development. To date, no services have been provided under this agreement. 
         On August 29, 2016, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Kleo to purchase 3,000,000 shares of Kleo's common stock at an initial closing, with a commitment to purchase an aggregate of 5,500,000 additional shares of common stock, in each case at a share price of $1.00 per share). We purchased 3,000,000 shares upon the initial closing on August 31, 2016, and the remaining 5,500,000 shares were purchased in four equal tranches of 1,375,000 shares, which we completed in March, June and October 2017 and January 2018. In connection with the initial investment, we received the right to designate two members of Kleo's board of directors. 
         In March 2017, we purchased 500,000 shares of Kleo common stock directly from a co-founder of Kleo for consideration of $249,750 in cash and 32,500 of our common shares. 
         In addition to these purchases, in October 2017, we purchased an additional aggregate of 2,049,543 shares for cash consideration of $2.3 million which allowed us to maintain our relative ownership interest in Kleo. Upon completion of the fourth tranche in January 2018, our ownership interest in the outstanding stock of Kleo was 46.6%. 
   Competition 
         The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
         The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their safety, efficacy, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
         Many of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 37

     CGRP Receptor Antagonist Platform 
         With regard to rimegepant and BHV-3500, our compounds target acute treatment of migraine and migraine prevention. We face competition from companies that develop and/or sell the following types of migraine treatments: 
 Triptans (Acute Treatment of Migraine) 
         Clinicians use a number of pharmacologic agents for the acute treatment and/or prevention of migraine. Initial management is often with over-the-counter products (e.g. Excedrin, ibuprofen) or some prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (e.g. diclofenac). The dominant class of prescription medication for the acute treatment of migraine are serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists, or triptans. There are seven different triptans (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan), the first of which was developed and approved over 25 years ago and, today, all triptans are generic. The initial introduction of triptans represented a shift toward drugs more selectively targeting the suspected pathophysiology of migraine. A 5-HT1F receptor antagonist, lasmiditan, could be approved as early as 2019. Lasmiditan was developed by CoLucid and acquired by Eli Lilly in January 2017. Lasmiditan could be the first new class of agent approved for the acute treatment of migraine since the triptans and, if approved, would be launched prior to rimegepant. Lasmiditan was designed to act through non-vasoconstrictive mechanisms in the 5-HT1 pathways such that patients who have cardiovascular risk factors, stable cardiovascular disease, or those who are dissatisfied with current triptan therapies could be treated. In August 2017, Lilly announced that lasmiditan met both its primary (pain freedom) and key secondary (most bothersome symptom) endpoints at 2 hours. Lilly plans to submit lasmiditan for approval in the second half of 2018.            Preliminary data from lasmiditan, compared with the results from the rimegepant program, would suggest ability to differentiate on both durability of benefit and AEs. 
 Other Oral CGRP Candidates in Development 
         Since we will be pursuing approval of our orally available, small molecule rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine, the most relevant comparator to rimegepant is the oral CGRP receptor antagonist under development from Allergan, ubrogepant. Allergan recently announced results on an earnings call from the first of their Phase 3 studies (Achieve 1) with results from the second trial anticipated by mid-2018. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of orally administered ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg compared to placebo in a single migraine. Both doses showed a statistically greater percentage of ubrogepant patients pain free at 2 hours as compared to placebo, as well as statistical significance on the co-primary, absence of the most bothersome migraine associated symptom at 2 hours post dose. Patients were permitted to take a second dose of investigational product or rescue medication after the 2 hour time point. Durability of effect was not shared beyond 8 hours post dose, at which time pain freedom appeared statistically significantly more improved than placebo for both doses of ubrogepant. Ubrogepant was well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to placebo. There were 6 cases of LFTs (ALT or AST) >3x ULN (1 on placebo, 5 on ubrogepant): 2 cases of LFTs >5x ULN on ubrogepant and 1 case of LFTs >10x ULN on ubrogepant. No cases were determined to have a probable relationship to study drug. There were no cases of Hy's Law. Launch of ubrogepant is anticipated in the first quarter 2020. Based on the published Phase 2 studies with both of rimegepant and ubrogepant, and the early data from the Phase 3 study of ubrogepant, we believe rimegepant has the potential to be best-in-class. Allergan is a global pharmaceutical company with presence in the CNS area and, in particular, with physicians treating chronic migraine through its Botox franchise. 
 38

     Other Acute Treatments for Migraine 
         Ergot alkaloids (such as Dihydroergotamine ("DHE")), analgesics, including opioids, NSAIDs, acetaminophen and antiemetics also are used in the acute treatment of migraine. DHE is also a potent vasoconstrictor and has been primarily displaced by the introduction of the triptans. Opioid use for migraine is associated with increased disability and health care utilization. Opioids, while effective for headache pain, are not approved for migraine and carry risk of abuse and addiction. 
 Migraine Prevention Treatments 
         Agents currently used to reduce the frequency of migraine episodes were first approved for other uses (e.g. beta blockers, antidepressants, anticonvulsants). Botox is the only product that has been approved by the FDA for the prevention of chronic migraine (defined as at least 15 headache days per month, at least 8 of which are migraine). For those patients who do not qualify as having chronic migraine, but still have significant disability due to migraine, there are five products approved by the FDA for use: topiramate (Topamax) and valproic acid (Depakote), both anticonvulsant medicines, propranolol (Inderal) and timolol (Blocadren), both beta-blockers, and amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant. 
         The biologic CGRP therapies have been studied for the prevention of migraine. Phase 3 studies for erenumab (Amgen/Novartis) and framenezumab (Teva) have recently been published and both of these agents, in addition to galcanezumab (Lilly) and ALD-403 (Alder) are expected to begin to enter the market in the second half of 2018. These therapies, while effective, do not eliminate the need for acute treatment of migraine attacks. In addition, they all require SQ or IV administration. We believe that BHV-3500 may have the opportunity to differentiate from these therapies due to its potential to be used for both the acute treatment and prevention of migraine. 
   Glutamate Platform 
         With respect to trigriluzole, which we are currently developing for the treatment of ataxias, OCD and Alzheimer's disease, there are currently no approved drug treatments for SCA or any other cerebellar ataxia, in the United States. 
         We are aware of companies with clinical stage programs in development for potential treatments for SCA and other cerebellar disorders, including Bioblast Pharma, which is in Phase 2 development of trehalose, which targets SCA 3 and acts as a protein stabilizer; Steminent Biotherapeutics, which is currently conducting a Phase 2 trial of allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells that target polyglutamine SCAs; EryDel which is planning a Phase 3 trial for its product, IEDAT01, which delivers dexamethasone sodium phosphate through red blood cells, Shionogi & CO., Ltd., which is investigating Rovatirelin, a non-peptide mimetic of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, in a Phase 3 trial in Japan; Shire Plc, which is exploring Cuvitru, an intravenous immune globulin that is approved for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency disorders, in Phase 2 development. Mitsubishi Tanabe received approval for taltirelin, an oral thyrotropin releasing hormone, in Japan in 2009 but has not filed with the FDA to seek approval in the United States. 
         With regards to OCD, there have been no new classes of drugs approved in over a decade. We are not aware of other product candidates besides trigriluzole that are currently in clinical development targeting populations with OCD. 
         With respect to BHV-0223, which we are developing for the treatment of ALS, we believe our primary competitor is Covis Pharmaceuticals, which sells Rilutek, the brand name for riluzole, which is currently the only approved drug for the treatment of ALS in the United States. Riluzole is also generically available. Edaravone (Radicava, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma) was recently approved by the FDA in May 2017 for the treatment of ALS, based on efficacy studies conducted in Japan with the vast 
 39

   majority of patients on background riluzole therapy. Edaravone is administered to patients by intravenous infusion. We are aware of at least two other companies that are marketing or plan to market new formulations of riluzole: Aquestive Therapeutics has filed an IND to begin clinical development of a riluzole oral soluble film, and Italfarmaco SpA, a private Italian company, markets an oral liquid suspension formulation of riluzole in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe under the brand name Teglutik. We are aware of several companies that are exploring potential treatments for ALS, mostly agents with novel mechanisms of action being administered with riluzole. We are not aware of any company marketing or developing a sublingual formulation of riluzole. Other companies of which we are not aware may also be developing formulations using the API riluzole; if such companies pursued regulatory approval of such product candidates using the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, those product candidates would potentially compete with BHV-0223. For example, Italfarmaco and Aquestive have obtained orphan designation for their products, and are eligible to obtain orphan exclusivity subject to a showing of clinical superiority to riluzole. Based on orphan drug designation requirements, the first approval of a novel formulation of riluzole may obligate subsequent formulations to demonstrate advantages with regard to safety, efficacy or meaningful contribution to patient care, in order to achieve marketing authorization. 
         With respect to BHV-5000, which we are developing for the treatment of Rett syndrome, there are currently no approved treatments for Rett syndrome in the United States. We are aware of companies with clinical stage programs in development for potential treatments for Rett syndrome, including Newron Pharmaceuticals SpA which is launching a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of sarizotan, an agent with serotonin subtype-1A (5-HT1A) receptor agonist and dopamine subtype-2 (D2) receptor antagonist activities, and Neuren Pharma, which has completed a Phase 2a trial of trofinetide in adult patients and a Phase 2 trial in pediatric patients with Rett syndrome. 
         If we expand our development of trigriluzole, BHV-0223 or BHV-5000 into additional neuropsychiatric or other indications, we would face substantial competition from companies that develop or sell products that treat those indications. 
   Manufacturing 
         We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if our product candidates receive marketing approval. 
         All of our product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 
   Commercialization 
         We intend to develop and, if approved by the FDA, commercialize our product candidates in the United States, and we may enter into distribution or licensing arrangements for commercialization rights for other regions. 
         With respect to rimegepant and BHV-3500, we plan to build a specialty team of sales and medical marketing professionals to focus on targeting neurological specialists and headache centers in the United States, potentially in combination with a larger pharmaceutical partner, to maximize patient coverage in the United States and to support global expansion. 
 40

           With respect to the product candidates in our glutamate modulation platform, we currently intend to build a neurological specialty sales force to manage orphan drug commercialization for these product candidates on our own. 
   Intellectual Property 
         We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain the proprietary position of our products and our other development programs. 
 Patents and Patent Applications 
         We have approximately 400 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications in our portfolio related to the composition of matter, methods of use, methods of manufacture or formulations of our product candidates which have been filed in major markets throughout the world, including the United States, Europe, Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong and Australia. 
   Rimegepant and BHV-3500 
         The intellectual property rights related to rimegepant and BHV-3500 are in-licensed from BMS and are covered by five families of U.S. and certain selected foreign patents, with statutory expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2033. U.S. Patent 8,314,117 covers the composition of matter of rimegepant, and has a statutory expiration date of October 12, 2030, not including patent term adjustment or any potential patent term extension. U.S. Patent 8,481,546 covers the composition of matter of BHV-3500, and has a statutory expiration date of March 2, 2031, not including patent term adjustment or any potential patent term extension. These or other patents cover rimegepant and BHV-3500 and their use in treating migraine and, in certain ex-U.S. jurisdictions, other neurological conditions. The license also includes several patent families of related compounds directed to the CGRP receptor. We also have an agreement with Catalent whereby Catalent granted an exclusive license under certain of its patents and technology to use the Zydis ODT technology for development of our rimegepant product. Catalent retains all manufacturing rights. 
   Trigriluzole 
         We own several families of patent applications containing claims directed to prodrugs of riluzole. These patent applications include several U.S. applications and corresponding PCT applications. These families of patent applications contain claims directed to trigriluzole and numerous other prodrugs of riluzole. In addition, the use of these compounds for treating ALS, SCA, depression and other diseases is described and claimed in these patent applications. We own these patent applications subject to a license agreement with ALS Biopharma and Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc. If a patent covering trigriluzole issues from one of these pending patent application families, it would have a statutory expiration date in 2036. Other patent applications provide coverage for alternative formulations of riluzole prodrugs and their uses. 
 41

          
  BHV-0223 
         BHV-0223, a sublingual or ODT form of riluzole, and its use for treating various forms of pain, ALS and depression are covered by two families of patent applications pending in the U.S. and selected foreign jurisdictions, each patent family having a statutory expiration date in 2035. We have an agreement with Catalent whereby Catalent granted an exclusive license under certain of its patents and technology to use the Zydis ODT technology for our BHV-0223 product. Catalent retains all manufacturing rights. In addition to patent protection, although not an NCE, BHV-0223 may also be entitled to certain regulatory exclusivity. In addition to the patent applications we own, we have also licensed one issued patent and several pending patent applications from Yale University which provide protection for the use of riluzole in treating generalized anxiety disorder and other neurological uses, respectively. Further, we have licensed several patents from Rutgers University covering the use of riluzole for treating various forms of cancer and an animal model for tumors which may cover the use of BHV-0223 for treating the specific cancers. 
   BHV-5000 
         We have also in-licensed one patent family related to certain uses of lanicemine and a patent application family containing claims directed to BHV-5000 from AstraZeneca. They contain claims directed to the use of the base compound, lanicemine, in treating depression, and the structure of the prodrug form, BHV-5000, as well as the use of the prodrug in treating a variety of neurological diseases including Rett syndrome and depression. The issued patents related to uses of lanicemine have a statutory expiration date in 2019. The patent applications related to BHV-5000 would, if issued, have a statutory expiration date in 2033 and the corresponding U.S. patent has been issued. 
   Additional Licensed Patent Applications 
         We have also licensed a family of patent applications related to the treatment of depression with a combination of ketamine and scopolamine from Massachusetts General Hospital. 
 Patent Protection and Terms 
         The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent's term may, in certain cases, be extended by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the "Hatch-Waxman Act") permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension is not available for all approved products and, even if an approved product is eligible, only one patent covering the approved product may be extended, the extension can only be based on a single approved product, and the total extension granted cannot extend the remaining term of the patent beyond 14 years from product approval. 
         Furthermore, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products and processes like those we intend to develop and commercialize are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual 
 42

   property rights, can make it easier to challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of any patents that may issue, and, more generally, could affect the value of intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. 
   Third-Party Patent Filings 
         Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. Moreover, we may be aware of patent applications, but incorrectly predict the likelihood of those applications issuing with claims of relevance to us. 
         Under U.S. law, a person may be able to patent a discovery of a new way to use a previously known compound, even if such compound itself is patented, provided the newly discovered use is novel and non-obvious. Such a method-of-use patent, however, if valid, only protects the use of a claimed compound for the specified methods claimed in the patent. This type of patent does not prevent persons from using the compound for any previously known use of the compound. Further, this type of patent does not prevent persons from making and marketing the compound for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. 
   License Agreements 
   License Agreement with BMS 
 


Overview 

         In July 2016, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with BMS for the development and commercialization rights to rimegepant and BHV-3500, as well as other CGRP-related intellectual property. Subject to certain limitations and certain retained rights of BMS, the license included an exclusive license under certain BMS patent rights and BMS know-how to the extent necessary to research, discover, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, export and import licensed compounds and licensed products in the field of prevention, treatment or control of any disease, disorder or condition in humans. In exchange for these rights, we agreed to pay BMS initial payments, milestone payments and tiered royalties on net sales of licensed products under the agreement. Our initial payments to BMS totaled $9.0 million and were paid within 90 days after entering into the agreement. The milestone payments due to BMS under the agreement consist of development and commercial milestones. The development milestones due under the agreement depend on the licensed product being developed. Development milestones due under the agreement with respect to rimegepant or a derivative thereof total up to $127.5 million, and, for any product other than rimegepant or a derivative thereof, total up to $74.5 million. Commercial milestones total up to $150.0 million for each licensed product. If we receive revenue from sublicensing any of our rights under the agreement, we are also obligated to pay a portion of that revenue to BMS as well. The tiered royalty payments are based on annual worldwide net sales of licensed products under the agreement, with percentages in the low-to-mid teens. 
         We made a payment of $5.0 million to BMS pursuant to our obligations under the BMS agreement during the third quarter of 2017 for the achievement of a specified milestone. 
         Under the BMS agreement, we agreed to refrain, either ourselves or via our sublicensees or third parties, from engaging in the development and commercialization of specified competitive compounds for a period of seven years. Further, BMS has retained the right to use the licensed compounds for internal research purposes and for the generation of analogs and derivatives of licensed compounds. Our right to sublicense our rights under the BMS agreement, other than to an affiliate or to certain 
 43

   third-party manufacturers, is subject to BMS's prior written consent, which cannot be unreasonably withheld or delayed. While we will be responsible for preparing, prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents and applications and for defending them in post-grant proceedings, BMS must consent before a licensed patent or application is abandoned in a major jurisdiction. We will also be responsible for listing licensed patents in the Orange Book and for determining which patents will be extended based on any regulatory delays. 
 


Our Development, Regulatory and Commercialization Obligations 

         Under the agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products using the patent rights we have licensed from BMS, including setting forth a development plan with specific development activities and timelines, updating the development plan each year, providing BMS with annual reports of our progress and keeping BMS informed of material changes that may affect the development plan. With respect to any of the licensed products, we are solely responsible for all development, regulatory and commercial activities and costs. We are also obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve specified regulatory and commercial milestones, and maintain a sufficient supply of our products to satisfy our expected commercialization efforts in each country in which we sell such products. Following our first commercial sale of a product, we must provide BMS with periodic reports of our commercial activities. In connection with the agreement, BMS agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assign and transfer any INDs for the licensed compounds to us. 
 


Equity Consideration 

         As part of this agreement, we agreed to issue BMS common shares in the amount of $12.5 million upon the occurrence of specified events, including upon an initial public offering ("IPO"). In satisfaction of this obligation, in May 2017 upon the completion of our IPO, we issued 1,345,374 common shares to BMS. 
 


Right of First Negotiation 

         After we receive topline data from a Phase 3 trial of our most advanced product candidate licensed under the agreement, we must provide notice and a summary of the data to BMS. BMS will then have 60 days to exercise its right of first negotiation to regain its intellectual property rights or enter into a license agreement with us with respect to such product candidate. If we do not execute an agreement with BMS during this time period after using good faith efforts, we will have the right to retain our rights or sublicense our rights to third parties subject to the terms of the agreement. 
 


Non-Competition 

         Until 2023, neither we nor our affiliates may, ourselves or through or in collaboration with a third party, engage directly or indirectly in the clinical development or commercialization of specified competitive compounds. In the event that we are or become non-compliant with this provision due to licensing, collaboration or acquisition activity, we must either divest ourselves of the competitive compound within a certain period of time or negotiate with BMS to have the competitive compound included as a licensed product under our agreement with BMS. The failure to so divest or reach terms with BMS may result in the termination of our license with BMS. 
 


Term and Termination 

         The agreement will terminate on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the royalty term with respect to each licensed product in each country. The patents related to the licensed products have statutory expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2033. 
 44

   BMS has the right to terminate the agreement upon our insolvency or bankruptcy, our uncured material breach, including our failure to meet our development and commercialization obligations, our challenge to any BMS patent rights, or our failure to close a financing within specified parameters. We have the right to terminate the agreement if BMS materially breaches the agreement or if, after we provide notice, we choose not to move forward with development and commercialization in a specific country. In the event that BMS exercises its right to terminate the agreement following our insolvency, our breach of the agreement or our failure to develop or commercialize the licensed compounds, or if we terminate the agreement after providing notice, all rights and licenses granted to us will terminate, and all patent rights and know-how transferred pursuant to the agreement will revert to BMS. In addition, upon such termination, we agree to, at BMS's election, (i) assign all regulatory filings, approvals and regulatory documents necessary to further develop and commercialize the reverted products or (ii) withdraw or inactivate such filings and approvals. 
   Agreement with ALS Biopharma, LLC and Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center Inc. 
         In August 2015, we entered into an agreement with ALS Biopharma and FCCDC pursuant to which ALS Biopharma and FCCDC assigned to us their worldwide patent rights to a family of over 300 prodrugs of glutamate modulating agents, including trigriluzole, as well as other innovative technologies. In addition, we received a non-exclusive license to certain trade secrets and know-how of ALS Biopharma. We took assignment of these patent rights subject to the provisions of the Bayh Dole Act, as applicable, to the extent that any invention included with the assigned patent rights was funded in whole or in part by the United States government. In addition, certain of the patent rights that do not cover trigriluzole were co-owned by Rutgers, and thus, we took assignment of these patent rights subject to the co-ownership interest of Rutgers. Under the agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently commercialize and develop markets for the patent products. 
         As consideration for this assignment of patent rights, we paid ALS Biopharma $2.5 million between August 2015 and November 2016 as funding for research to be performed by ALS Biopharma in connection with a mutually agreed upon research plan. We are also obligated to pay regulatory milestone payments of $3.0 million upon a specified regulatory approval for the first licensed product under the agreement as well as additional milestone payments of $1.0 million for each licensed product that completes the specified regulatory milestone thereafter. We are also obligated to make royalty payments of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of products licensed under the agreement, payable on a quarterly basis. 
 


Equity Consideration 

         As part of the agreement, we also issued to ALS Biopharma 50,000 common shares as well as two warrants to purchase a total of 600,000 common shares with an exercise price of $5.60 per share, of which 275,000 shares were immediately exercisable at issuance and the remaining 325,000 shares became exercisable upon our achievement of a specified regulatory milestone. This milestone was achieved in May 2016. We also agreed to grant specified preemptive rights to ALS Biopharma to participate in equity offerings that are open to our other shareholders. 
         In January 2018, ALS Biopharma exercised a warrant for the purchase of 275,000 shares through a net share settlement. The Company issued 228,119 shares as a result of the exercise. 
 


Term and Termination 

         The agreement terminates on a country-by-country basis as the last patent rights expire in each such country. Our current patent rights consist of owning several families of patent applications. If a patent covering trigriluzole issues from one of these pending patent applications, it would have a 
 45

   statutory expiration date in 2036. ALS Biopharma has the right to terminate the agreement or its applicability to one or more countries upon 30 days' prior written notice to us if we fail to make an undisputed payment within the 60-day period after receipt of a termination notice or if we commit a material breach of the agreement that is not cured within the 60-day period after receipt of a termination notice. We have the right to terminate the agreement if ALS Biopharma commits a material breach of the agreement that is not cured within the 60-day period after written notice thereof from us or, as to a specific country, if no valid claims exist in such country. Both we and ALS Biopharma may terminate the agreement as to a specific country if we are enjoined from exercising our patent rights under the agreement in such country. If we affirmatively abandon our development, research, licensing or sale of all products covered by one or more claims of any patent or patent application assigned under the agreement, or if we cease operations, we have agreed to reassign the applicable patent rights back to ALS Biopharma. 
   License Agreement with AstraZeneca 
 


Overview 

         In October 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca pursuant to which AstraZeneca granted us a license to certain patent rights and know-how for all human uses for the commercial development, manufacture, distribution and use of any products or processes resulting from development of those patent rights, including BHV-5000 and lanicemine. 
         Under the AstraZeneca agreement, we have the right to sublicense our rights under the agreement subject to AstraZeneca's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. We will be responsible for preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents and applications, and for Orange Book listing any listable patents. We have the right to enforce the licensed patents and to defend challenges to the validity or enforceability of the licensed patents. AstraZeneca, however, retains the right to apply for patent term extensions for the licensed patents. We may not assign our rights or delegate our obligations under the AstraZeneca agreement without AstraZeneca's consent, including in the event of a change of control. 
         In exchange for these rights, in addition to the agreement to issue equity consideration noted below, we agreed to pay AstraZeneca an upfront payment, milestone payments and royalties on net sales of licensed products under the agreement. We made the upfront payment to AstraZeneca of $5.0 million upon signing the agreement. The milestone payments due to AstraZeneca under the agreement consist of regulatory and commercial milestones. The regulatory milestones due under the agreement depend on the indication of the licensed product being developed as well as the territory where regulatory approval is obtained. Development milestones due under the agreement with respect to Rett syndrome total up to $30.0 million, and, for any indication other than Rett syndrome, total up to $60.0 million. Commercial milestones are based on net sales of all products licensed under the agreement and total up to $120.0 million. We have agreed to pay tiered royalties of mid single-digit to low double-digit percentages based on net sales of products licensed under the agreement. If we receive revenue from sublicensing any of our rights under the agreement, we are also obligated to pay a portion of that revenue to AstraZeneca. 
 


Our Development, Regulatory and Commercialization Obligations 

         Under the agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, and obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for, licensed products using the rights we have licensed from AstraZeneca, including providing AstraZeneca with annual reports of our development activities. With respect to any of the licensed products, we are solely responsible for all development, regulatory and commercial activities and costs. Following our first commercial sale of a product, we must provide AstraZeneca with periodic reports of our commercial activities. AstraZeneca agreed to use 
 46

   commercially reasonable efforts to transfer all of its regulatory documentation related to BHV-5000 and lanicemine in each country to us, including all INDs, NDAs and approvals, promptly following the effective date of the agreement. 
 


Right of First Negotiation 

         After we receive topline data from the first Phase 2b study of a product candidate licensed under the agreement, we must provide notice and a summary of the data to AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca will then have a period of time to exercise its right of first negotiation to regain its intellectual property rights or enter into a sublicense agreement with us. If AstraZeneca does not give notice of its intent to exercise its right of first negotiation during this time period, or we do not execute a definitive agreement within an additional time period, we will have the sole right, in our discretion, to negotiate and execute any agreement with third parties, or to retain our rights. 
 


Equity Consideration 

         As part of the consideration, we agreed to issue to AstraZeneca common shares in the amount of $5.0 million if we completed a financing within specified parameters. This condition was satisfied upon the closing of our Series A preferred share financing, at which time we issued 538,150 Series A preferred shares to AstraZeneca which, at the completion of our IPO, automatically converted into 538,150 common shares. In addition, we agreed to issue to AstraZeneca common shares in the amount of $5.0 million upon the completion of specified events, including upon an IPO. In satisfaction of this obligation, in May 2017 upon the completion of our IPO, we issued an additional 538,149 common shares to AstraZeneca. 
 


Term and Termination 

         The agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last royalty term for the last licensed product under the agreement. Each royalty term begins on the date of the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country and ends on the later of 10 years from such first commercial sale or the expiration of the last to expire of the applicable patents in that country. The patent applications related to BHV-5000 would, if issued, have a statutory expiration date in 2033. Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party's uncured material breach or upon insolvency or bankruptcy. AstraZeneca also has the right to terminate the agreement in certain circumstances. We have the right to terminate the agreement without cause. In the event the agreement is terminated in its entirety for any reason, all rights and licenses granted to us by AstraZeneca under the agreement, and all sublicenses granted by us under the agreement, immediately terminate, and we are required to assign to AstraZeneca all of the regulatory documentation applicable to any licensed compound or licensed product owned or controlled by us or our affiliates, to transfer control of any clinical studies involving licensed products to AstraZeneca and continue such studies at our cost for six months, and to assign to AstraZeneca all of our agreements with third parties that are reasonably necessary for the exploitation of the licensed products. 
   Agreements with Catalent U.K. Swindon Zydis Limited 
         In March 2015, we entered into a development and license agreement with Catalent pursuant to which we obtained certain license rights to the Zydis ODT technology in BHV-0223. BHV-0223 was developed under this agreement. Catalent has manufactured BHV-0223 for clinical testing and we expect them to do so for commercial supply. We made an upfront payment of $0.3 million to Catalent upon entering into the agreement and are obligated to pay Catalent up to $1.6 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones. We are also obligated to make royalty payments of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of products licensed under the agreement. 
 47

           Under the agreement, we are responsible for conducting clinical trials and for preparing and filing regulatory submissions. We have the right to sublicense our rights under the agreement subject to Catalent's prior written consent. Catalent has the right to enforce the patents covering the Zydis technology and to defend any allegation that a formulation using Zydis technology, such as BHV-0223, infringes a third party's patent. 
         The development and license agreement terminates on a country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) 10 years after the launch of the most recently launched product in such country and (ii) the expiration of the last valid claim covering each product in such country, unless earlier voluntarily terminated by us. Our current patent rights with respect to BHV-0223 consist of owning several patent applications. If a patent covering BHV-0223 issues from one of these pending patent applications, it would have a statutory expiration date in 2035. The agreement automatically extends for one-year terms unless either party gives advance notice of intent to terminate. In addition, Catalent may terminate the agreement either in its entirety or terminate the exclusive nature of the agreement on a country-by-country basis if we fail to meet specified development timelines, which we may extend in certain circumstances. 
         In January 2018, we entered into a development and license agreement with Catalent pursuant to which we obtained certain license rights to the Zydis ODT technology for use with rimegepant. If we obtain regulatory approval or launch a rimegepant product that utilizes the Zydis ODT technology, we are obligated to pay Catalent up to $1.5 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones. If we commercialize a rimegepant product that utilizes the Zydis ODT technology, the agreement permits us to purchase the commercial product from Catalent at a fixed price, inclusive of a royalty. Under the agreement, Catalent agreed that it will not develop or manufacture a formulation of any oral CGRP compound using Zydis ODT technology for itself or a third party for a specified period of time, subject to certain minimum commercial revenues. 
   License Agreement with Yale University 
         In September 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Yale to obtain rights under certain patent rights for the commercial development, manufacture, distribution, use and sale of products and processes resulting from the development of those patent rights related to the use of riluzole in treating various neurological conditions such as general anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. As part of the consideration for this license, we issued Yale 250,000 of our common shares and granted Yale the right to purchase up to 10% of the securities issued in each of our equity offerings. Under the terms of the agreement, in the event of a change of control, as defined in the agreement to include our IPO, we will be obligated to pay to Yale the lesser of (i) 5% of the dollar value of all initial and future potential consideration paid or payable by the acquirer or (ii) $1.5 million as a change-of-control payment. In the event of an IPO, which we completed in May 2017, the change-of-control payment to Yale is reduced by the value of Yale's equity investment in our company. The value of this change-of-control payment was determined to be zero at the expiration of the lockup period in October 2017 since the value of shares at the end of the lockup were worth more than their initial equity investment. 
         In addition, we agreed to pay Yale regulatory milestone payments of up to $2.0 million and annual royalty payments of a low-single digit percentage based on net sales of products from the licensed patents, subject to a minimum amount of up to $1.0 million per year. If we grant any sublicense rights under the agreement, we must pay Yale a low single-digit percentage of sublicense income that we receive. 
         The agreement also requires us to meet certain due diligence requirements based upon specified milestones. We can elect to extend the due diligence requirements by a maximum of one year upon payments of up to $150,000 to Yale. We are also required to reimburse Yale for any fees that Yale 
 48

   incurs related to the filing, prosecution, defending and maintenance of patent rights licensed under the agreement. In the event that we fail to make any payments, commit a material breach, fail to maintain adequate insurance or if we challenge the patent rights of Yale, Yale can terminate the agreement. We can terminate the agreement with 90-days' notice if Yale commits a material breach or in a specific country if there are no valid patent rights. The agreement expires on a country-by-country basis upon the later of expiration of the patent rights or ten years from the date of first sale. Any patent that has issued or does issue from one of the pending patent applications under this agreement would have a statutory expiration date in 2026. 
   License Agreement with The General Hospital Corporation d/b/a Massachusetts General Hospital 
         In September 2014, we entered into a license agreement with The General Hospital Corporation d/b/a Massachusetts General Hospital ("MGH") pursuant to which MGH granted us a license under certain patent rights for the commercial development, manufacture, distribution and use of any products or processes resulting from development of those patent rights, related to treating depression with a combination of ketamine and scopolamine. Under this agreement, we paid MGH an upfront license fee of $20,000. We are also obligated to pay MGH annual license maintenance fees up to $50,000, beginning in 2017. In addition, we are obligated to pay MGH future milestone payments of up to $750,000 upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones and up to $2.5 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones. We have also agreed to pay MGH royalties of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of products licensed under the agreement. We are also required to reimburse MGH for any fees that MGH incurs related to the filing, prosecution, defending and maintenance of patent rights licensed under the agreement. If we receive revenue from sublicensing any of our rights under the agreement, we are also obligated to pay a portion of that revenue to MGH. 
         The agreement expires upon the expiration of the patent rights licensed under the agreement, which could occur as early as 2033, unless earlier terminated by either party. 
   License Agreement with Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey 
         In June 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, licensing several patents and patent applications related to the use of riluzole to treat various cancers. Certain of the Rutgers patent rights were developed using federal funding. Accordingly, the U.S. Government has certain rights in the Rutgers patents and applications. We have the right to sublicense our rights under the Rutgers Agreement. We are responsible for prosecuting and maintaining the patents and applications in the Rutgers patent rights, and Rutgers has an opportunity to review and comment on correspondences with government patent offices. We have the right to prepare any documents related to the application for an extension of the term of any licensed patent and to list any listable patents in the Orange Book. We have the first right to enforce the licensed patents. 
         Under this agreement, we are required to pay Rutgers annual license maintenance fees of up to $25,000 per year until the first commercial sale of a licensed product. We are also obligated to pay Rutgers payments totaling up to $825,000 upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones. We also agreed to pay Rutgers royalties of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of licensed products sold by us, our affiliates or sublicensees, subject to a minimum of up to $100,000 per year. If we grant any sublicense rights under the license agreement, we must pay Rutgers a low double-digit percentage of sublicense income we receive. In the event that we experience a change of control or sale of substantially all of our assets prior to the initiation of a Phase 3 trial related to products licensed under the agreement, and such change of control or sale results in a full liquidation of our company, we will be obligated to pay Rutgers a change-of-control fee equal to 0.3% of the total value of the transaction, but not less than $100,000. 
 49

           The agreement also requires us to meet certain due diligence requirements based upon specified milestones. We can elect to extend the due diligence requirements by a maximum of one year upon payments to Rutgers of up to $500,000 in the aggregate. 
         The agreement expires on a country-by-country basis upon the later of expiration of the last patent rights to expire in such country, which could occur as early as 2024, or ten years from the date of first commercial sale of a licensed product, unless terminated by either party. 
   Government Regulation 
         In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including imposition of a clinical hold, refusal by the FDA to approve applications, withdrawal of an approval, import/export delays, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities. 
         The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are governed by extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The FDA, under the FDCA, regulates pharmaceutical products in the United States. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include:
 

 preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under GLP; 
 the submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence; 
 approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB"), representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
 adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each indication and conducted in
accordance with Good Clinical Practices ("GCP"); 
 the preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
 FDA acceptance, review and approval of the NDA, which might include an Advisory Committee review; 
 satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are made to assess
compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMPs"). 

         The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain. The FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 50

          
  Preclinical and Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA 
         Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of the product candidate, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of preclinical trials is subject to federal regulations and requirements including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be commenced. The IND will become effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND prior to that time. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. The FDA may nevertheless initiate a clinical hold after the 30 days if, for example, significant public health risks arise. 
         Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at each of the sites at which the trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. 
         Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap or be combined. These phases generally include the following: 
 
Phase 1.    Phase 1 clinical trials represent the initial introduction of a product candidate into human subjects, frequently
healthy volunteers. In Phase 1, the product candidate is usually tested for safety, including adverse effects, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and
pharmacodynamics. 
Phase 2.    Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to (1) evaluate the efficacy
of the product candidate for specific indications, (2) determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. 
Phase 3.    If a product candidate is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2
clinical trials, the clinical trial program will be expanded to Phase 3 clinical trials to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population
at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. 
Phase 4.    clinical trials may be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the
intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of
post-market requirements or commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in enforcement action or withdrawal of approval. 

         A Phase 2/3 trial design, which we are using in our trigriluzole and BHV-5000 development programs, is often used in the development of pharmaceutical and biological products. The trial includes Phase 2 elements, such as an early interim analysis of safety or activity, and Phase 3 elements, such as larger patient populations with less restrictive enrollment criteria. The early interim analysis of clinical or physiologic activity and/or safety allows the study to be stopped, changed or continued before a large number of patients have been enrolled, while still allowing all data from enrolled patients to count in the analysis used to support approval. 
   Submission and Review of an NDA 
         The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the product's manufacture, composition, quality, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, requesting approval to market the product. The 
 51

   application must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment, which typically increases annually, although waivers may be granted in limited cases. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. 
         Once an NDA has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission, the FDA sets a user fee goal date that informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review. We will be required to pay a user fee to the FDA to review the NDA, unless we receive a waiver or qualify for an exemption. This is typically 10 months from the date that the FDA receives the application-filing for standard review NDAs (i.e., NDAs seeking approval of drugs that are not new molecular entities). The review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews NDAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facilities comply with cGMPs. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites for compliance with GCP and integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy. 
         During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy ("REMS") is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS, and the FDA will not approve the application without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval. The FDA could also require a special warning, known as a boxed warning, to be included in the product label in order to highlight a particular safety risk. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit and interpretation of clinical trial data. The FDA may delay approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and/or the FDA requires additional testing or information. The FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
         On the basis of the FDA's evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA will issue either an approval of the NDA or a Complete Response Letter, detailing the deficiencies in the submission and the additional testing or information required for reconsideration of the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
   Post-Approval Requirements 
         Approved drugs that are manufactured or distributed in the United States pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims and some manufacturing and supplier changes are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for certain supplemental applications. 
         The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to further assess and monitor the product's safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The FDA may also require a REMS, which could involve requirements for, among 
 52

   other things, medication guides, special trainings for prescribers and dispensers, patient registries, and elements to assure safe use. 
         In addition, entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. The FDA has promulgated specific requirements for drug cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
         Once an approval is granted, the FDA may issue enforcement letters or withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Corrective action could delay product distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

 restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market
or product recalls; 
 fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
 product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

         The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. 
   Section 505(b)(2) NDAs 
         As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of drugs previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This type of application permits reliance for such approvals on literature or on an FDA finding of safety, effectiveness or both for an approved drug product. As such, under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA may rely, for approval of an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or 
 53

   measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for the new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant. 
         Our clinical programs for trigriluzole for the treatment of SCA and BHV-0223 for the treatment of ALS are each based on a regulatory pathway under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA that allows reference to data on riluzole for the purpose of safety assessments. 
   Orange Book Listing 
         In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant's product or an approved method of using the product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA"), seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify, for each patent listed in the Orange Book for the referenced drug, to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, (2) such patent has expired, (3) if such patent has not expired, the date on which it expires or (4) such patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The fourth certification described above is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a "section viii" statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of- use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. This section viii statement does not require notice to the patent holder or NDA owner. There might also be no relevant patent certification. 
         If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. Even if the 45 days expire, a patent infringement lawsuit can be brought and could delay market entry, but it would not extend the FDA-related 30-month stay of approval. 
         The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below. 
   Non-Patent Exclusivity 
         In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. 
         A drug, including one approved under a 505(b)(2) application, may obtain a three-year period of non-patent market exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity 
 54

   period has run. However, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the three-year exclusivity period. A 505(b)(2) NDA may also be subject to a five-year exclusivity period for a new chemical entity, whereby the FDA will not accept for filing, with limited exception, a product seeking to rely upon the FDA's findings of safety or effectiveness for such new chemical entity. 
   Orphan Drugs 
         Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or in other limited cases. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan drugs may be eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing. In addition, an NDA for a product that has received orphan drug designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated. A Company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA. 
         Generally, if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same active moiety for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as another drug's showing of clinical superiority over the drug with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different active moieties for the same indication or obtain approval for the same active moiety for a different indication. In some cases, orphan drug status is contingent on a product with an orphan drug designation showing that it is clinically superior to a previously approved product or products. 
   Foreign Regulation 
         In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and other geographies, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 Coverage, Reimbursement and Pricing 
         Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, and private entities, such as managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an 
 55

   approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. For example, the payor's reimbursement payment rate may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. However, one third-party payor's decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Further, some third-party payors may require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they provide reimbursement for use of such therapies. 
         Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product. These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. Thus, obtaining and maintaining reimbursement status is time-consuming and costly. 
         The U.S. and foreign governments regularly consider reform measures that affect health care coverage and costs. For example, the U.S. and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription products. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act ("collectively, the ACA") contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of products, including, for example, increased rebates for products sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies' share of sales to federal health care programs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") set a goal of moving 30% of Medicare payments to alternative payment models tied to the quality or value of services by 2016 and 50% of Medicare payments into these alternative payment models by the end of 2018. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for our products. 
         The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the focus on cost containment measures, particularly in the United States, has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if we attain favorable coverage and reimbursement status for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
   European Union Coverage Reimbursement and Pricing 
         In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been 
 56

   agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies, or so called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company. 
   Healthcare Laws and Regulations 
         Physicians, other healthcare providers, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors are and will be subject to various federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may impact, among other things, our arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare professionals who participate in our clinical research programs, healthcare professionals and others who purchase, recommend or prescribe our approved products, and our proposed sales, marketing, distribution, and education programs. The U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation, the following:


 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or
paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for
which payment may be made under federally funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value; 
 The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the federal civil monetary penalties law and the civil False
Claims Act (which can be enforced by private citizens through qui tam actions), prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly
presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of federal funds, and knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or
fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") which imposes criminal liability for executing or attempting
to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making
any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 ("HITECH") and its implementing
regulations, which imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health
information without the appropriate authorization by entities subject to the law, such as healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses and their respective business associates; 
 The federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of
drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid ("CHIP") to report to HHS information related 

 57

   

to
payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests; and 


 Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that impose similar restrictions and may apply to
items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs, comply with the
pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration
provided to physicians and other health care providers; and state health information privacy and data breach notification laws, which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of
health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

         We will be required to spend substantial time and money to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. Recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these federal and state healthcare laws. For example, the ACA amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes to clarify that liability under these statutes does not require a person or entity to have actual knowledge of the statutes or a specific intent to violate them. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. 
         Violations of these laws can subject us to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions including monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and reputational harm, we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations. Moreover, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state laws and regulations, proposed and implemented, that could impact our future operations and business. 
   Healthcare Reform 
         The legislative landscape in the United States continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following:


 an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drug agents or biologic agents, which is
apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 
 an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price
for branded and generic drugs, respectively; 

 58

   

 a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts to
negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare
Part D; 
 extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care
organizations, unless the drug is subject to discounts under the 340B drug discount program; 
 a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled,
infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 
 expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional
individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid
rebate liability; 
 expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; 
 new requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act for drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other
transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; 
 a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research,
along with funding for such research; 
 creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which, if and when impaneled, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the
Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs; and 
 establishment of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare
and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 

         Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of any certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the "individual mandate". Additionally, on January 23, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called "Cadillac" tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices.

        In addition, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, as a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011, providers are subject to Medicare payment reductions of 2% per fiscal year through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments from providers from three to five years. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 also introduced a quality payment program under which certain individual Medicare providers will be subject to certain incentives or penalties based on new program quality standards. Payment adjustments for the Medicare quality payment program will begin in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program. 
         Further, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the costs of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States has also been the subject of considerable discussion, and members of Congress and the Trump Administration have stated that they will address such costs through new legislative and administrative measures. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. 
   The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
         The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
