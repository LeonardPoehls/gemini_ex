The Company’s products are designed to improve the way that businesses communicate with their prospects and customers to increase sales. The Company’s flagship SharpSpring marketing automation platform uses advanced features such as web tracking, lead scoring and automated workflow to help businesses deliver the right message to the right customer at the right time.

Products and Services
 
SharpSpring Marketing Automation
 
Our SharpSpring marketing automation solution brings powerful digital marketing tools to small and medium-sized businesses and is primarily sold to marketing agencies who use the platform on behalf of their clients. SharpSpring’s powerful features, flexible platform, and ease-of-use allow customers to increase leads into their business, convert more leads to sales and measure the effectiveness of all their marketing campaigns. At the end of 2016, we had over 1,400 marketing automation customers and over 5,000 businesses using the platform, including agencies, agency clients and direct end users. SharpSpring provides this powerful, but simple-to-use marketing automation platform at a lower price than its competitors and in a framework that is especially appealing because of its inherently flexible architecture. The solution also offers a built-in CRM tool and call tracking functionality.
Email Marketing
 
During 2015 and the first half of 2016, the Company offered the GraphicMail email campaign management solution to customers globally. In late 2015, the Company announced that it would discontinue selling and offering the GraphicMail email solution and migrate existing GraphicMail customers to the SharpSpring platform, onto a new product named SharpSpring Mail+. SharpSpring Mail+ provides customers with some marketing automation functionality along with traditional email marketing capabilities. Prior to the migration of customers to SharpSpring Mail+, the GraphicMail platform focused on email, social and mobile marketing and was typically used by companies wishing to communicate with a list of subscribers or customers. Email marketing remains an effective form of digital marketing today and provides users with a high ROI on their marketing budget, which continues to drive email marketing industry growth. SharpSpring Mail+ customers have tools such as automated workflows, triggered emails and dynamic list segmentation to improve the effectiveness of their marketing programs.

SMTP Email Relay Services
 
On June 27, 2016, we sold the assets related to our SMTP email relay product to the Electric Mail Company, a Nova Scotia company. Prior to that, the Company offered a proprietary SMTP relay product, which was designed to send high volumes of email messages in an efficient manner and increase the delivery rate of email messages. For over a decade, customers turned to SMTP to ensure their emails were delivered to the inbox of their intended recipients. Companies sending large volumes of permission-based, opt-in email (email that a person has agreed to receive) often have difficulty getting those emails into the recipient’s inbox. In recent years, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have been forced to tighten email filters resulting in billions of legitimate emails never reaching their intended recipients. SMTP’s deliverability expertise and technology platform allowed customers to achieve higher rates of receipt, thus improving their marketing campaigns and communication efforts. This product is treated as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements.
Markets & Competition
 
We operate in the marketing technology market, with a focus on marketing automation which enables businesses to improve the number of leads they generate for their products, convert more leads to sales and measure the return on all their marketing programs. Although we are now focused nearly 100% on marketing automation, the company historically has offered products that perform traditional email marketing services and email relay (delivery) services. The Company’s email delivery services were sold in June 2016. The three markets served in 2016 include:

1) | Marketing automation products (highly targeted one-to-one messaging with sophisticated analytics); 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Traditional email marketing services (newsletters and one-to-many communications); and 
3) | Email delivery services (robust infrastructure for the delivery of high volumes of email) 

 
Marketing Automation: Our SharpSpring product competes primarily in the marketing automation market. Based on industry reports, our growth rate and the growth rate of our competitors, we believe the market for marketing automation technology is growing at approximately 60% per year currently. The market for marketing automation software and related solutions is new and evolving, with high barriers to entry due to the complex nature of the technology. SharpSpring entered the market in 2014 with a highly competitive offering that achieved meaningful customer adoption in its first three years after launch. At the end of 2016, SharpSpring had over 1,400 paying customers and approximately 5,000 businesses using the SharpSpring marketing automation platform, including agencies, agency clients and direct end-user customers. We face competition from cloud-based software and SaaS companies including HubSpot, Act-On, Pardot (acquired by SalesForce.com in July 2013) and Active Campaign. We differentiate ourselves from the competition with SharpSpring’s advanced features, ease of use, platform flexibility, and value compared to other competitive offerings. SharpSpring is designed as a solution for small or mid-sized businesses, but also focuses on selling to marketing agencies, who serve as partners providing a distribution channel to end customers. The Company’s SharpSpring Mail+ product provides customers an entry point into using marketing automation technology for customers that have historically used traditional email marketing solutions.
 
Traditional Email Marketing: Until the middle of 2016, the Company offered traditional email marketing capabilities through its GraphicMail product. During the second quarter of 2016, customers of the GraphicMail product were migrated to SharpSpring Mail+. GraphicMail historically competed in the email marketing space, with a product focused on the small and medium-size business market (SMB). GraphicMail was designed to provide customers with an easy-to-use email campaign management solution that includes design capabilities, reporting tools and list management functionality. GraphicMail competed with companies such as Constant Contact, iContact Corporation, The Rocket Science Group LLC (MailChimp), and VerticalResponse, Inc., a subsidiary of Deluxe Corporation, and others. GraphicMail, and most other vendors, typically charge a monthly fee or a fee per number of emails sent and, in some cases, have a free offering for low-volume or non-profit customers. GraphicMail’s local language and support had historically been market differentiators.
 
Email Delivery Services: Until the product’s sale in June 2016, the Company offered stand-alone SMTP relay services to customers seeking the highest levels of marketing and transactional email deliverability. Those customers may have in-house design teams, and internal analytics capabilities, so are typically less concerned with some of the “front end” capabilities of a full-service email marketing system. They often send significantly higher volumes of email and are therefore subject to higher risks of having their legitimate opt-in email inadvertently intercepted by SPAM filters. As a result, SMTP relay customers are typically far more concerned with successful email delivery than with the design and creation of email content. For this reason, SMTP’s relay services for improving deliverability are typically significantly lower in cost than sending via integrated packages. Until the sale of the product in June 2016, we competed with companies such as SendGrid, Mandrill, JangoMail, Amazon SES and others.

We are part of a constantly evolving and highly competitive marketplace. Some of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have, and have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. Additionally, some of our current and potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, and are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services. Barriers to entry are relatively high in the marketing automation market due to complexity of systems.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We sell our products globally, through our internal sales teams, and to a lesser extent, third party resellers. Before the discontinuation of GraphicMail and the sale of our SMTP email relay product, our products had separate and mostly distinct sales processes, which are described below. We use and rely on our own SharpSpring marketing automation platform to help our business generate leads, convert more leads to sales and monitor the effectiveness of all our marketing campaigns. Our websites www.sharpspring.com serves as a lead generation source and we use a variety of other digital marketing tools to attract new customers.
 
Our SharpSpring product sales process involves targeting customers, completing product demos and advancing customers through our marketing and sales pipeline to conversion using our SharpSpring marketing automation product. Since SharpSpring was launched fairly recently in 2014, brand recognition today is growing, but still fairly limited. Therefore, we are more reliant on outbound marketing and search engine traffic to attract potential leads. Our marketing efforts to date have been nearly 100% focused on digital marketing agencies, and we have had success signing up over 1,100 marketing agency partners as of December 31, 2016. These agencies become customers of ours and are able to resell SharpSpring to their clients, while paying increased fees to us as their client count expands beyond the base license. This allows the agency to provide services and first level support for their clients, which increases their own revenues from the end client and creates a longer-lasting relationship overall between the agency and client. We also sell SharpSpring directly to end-users and have over 270 direct end user customers on the platform. The Company’s sales are done primarily through internal resources, but a small number of third-party resellers were also used during 2016.
 
Since creating the SharpSpring Mail+ product to migrate the GraphicMail customers onto during the middle of 2016, we have spent limited resources marketing and selling SharpSpring Mail+ as a standalone product. During the second half of 2016, we did a small amount of prospecting for new SharpSpring Mail+ clients, and make the product available for demos and free trials for new customers. After the free trial, customers can select either a send plan, which incurs charges based on the number of emails sent through the platform, or a contact plan, which incurs charges based on the number of contacts (or leads) in the system. We intend to continue to devote limited resources to the sales and marketing process for SharpSpring Mail+ as a standalone product in the future.
 
Prior to its discontinuation in the middle of 2016, our GraphicMail sales and marketing efforts were designed to attract potential customers to our website, enroll them in a free trial, encourage them to engage with our products, convert them to paying customers and retain them as ongoing customers. We employed strategies to acquire customers by using a variety of sources, including online advertising and partner relationships and referrals. We advertised online through pay-per-click advertising with search engines, including Google, Yahoo!, Bing and others. We deployed banner advertising with online advertising networks and other websites likely to be frequented by SMB organizations. Additionally, GraphicMail used a network of third party resellers who distributed and sold GraphicMail in 14 countries. These resellers acted as local sales resources, performed marketing for the product and provided first level support, and received a large portion of the revenue related to sales of GraphicMail through those organizations. The Company discontinued the GraphicMail product and ended any reselling arrangements for GraphicMail with third parties.
 
Prior to its sale in June 2016, SMTP relay services were sold and leads were largely generated by the SMTP.com website. SMTP stands for “Simple Mail Transfer Protocol”, which is the internet protocol by which all email is sent globally. Despite the fact that we did not own the protocol, the SMTP name provided us immediate name recognition and domain context worldwide. In addition, the services we provided may be searched for online as “SMTP”, “SMTP relay services”, “SMTP services”, “SMTP providers”, or using similar terms. Our website may have appeared in search engine results for these and other queries in common search engines, such as Google, Yahoo!, Bing, and others. In addition, SMTP purchased online search advertising and other forms of online advertising to drive traffic to the website and referring partners provided us with leads. Referring partners were typically other service providers operating in the email ecosystem, who may provide related products and services that were non-competitive with our own. We paid those third parties between 15% and 30% of the revenue generated from their referrals.

Customers
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had over 1,400 customers for our SharpSpring product, the majority of which were marketing agencies. Including agency partners, agency clients and direct end user clients, we had over 5,000 businesses using the SharpSpring platform as of December 31, 2016.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had over 1,700 customers using our SharpSpring Mail+ product.
 
The vast majority of our customers are on month-to-month agreements, with a mixture of customers being charged in advance and in arrears. We have a small amount of customers that prepay for longer periods, such as quarterly or annually.
 
We are not heavily dependent on any one customer or even a few major customers. Our user base is diverse and the largest single customer represents less than 3% of our aggregate revenues. The loss of any one customer would not represent a material loss of sales. A large majority of our SharpSpring customers are marketing agencies who resell the SharpSpring product to their clients. From a client or end user perspective, we do not have any significant industry concentration in our customer base.
 
Technology & Technology Suppliers
 
Our SharpSpring product technology was developed internally over the past five years. SharpSpring’s key features include web tracking, customer relationship management, call tracking, lead scoring and nurturing, rule-based triggers and notifications and deep analytics to measure ROI. We offer value to our customers by providing integration with industry standard technologies like Salesforce.com and others, and third-party data providers like Zoom Info.
 
SharpSpring Mail+ is a subset of the SharpSpring technology. During late 2015 and the first half of 2016, we modified SharpSpring to support the SharpSpring Mail+ features and functionality using the existing platform. This involved creating a subset of the technology with more limited features for SharpSpring Mail+.
 
We decommissioned the GraphicMail product in the middle of 2016. GraphicMail had been developed over the past nine years and consisted of an email editor that customers used to create sharp, professional email campaigns. It had an easy to use interface, integrated with social media channels, offered mobile messaging and included tools to effectively track campaign results. GraphicMail historically utilized Postfix software to assist in spooling emails, which is an open source technology, but began using the SMTP relay service during 2015 as its primary email sending platform.
 
The Company sold the SMTP relay service in June 2016. The SMTP relay service product used Message Transfer Agent (MTA) technology provided by Message Systems. This software can handle large volumes of email and provides unique features such as adaptive delivery for managing email delivery issues, such as throttling by the ISP’s. Facebook, LinkedIn, and other very large email senders employ this same sophisticated software. Typically, our SMTP relay service customers would be too small and spend too little on email to be able to afford this type of sophisticated system on their own. The SMTP solution pooled a large number of customers into our proprietary and scalable system that handled billions of emails. The software was customized to optimize the speed at which email is delivered, and to manage the process of maximizing inbox delivery. The proprietary systems managed how emails are sent, and which IP addresses or pools of IP addresses were used for sending. We were able to control the speed and volume with which emails are released to various ISPs. Another key part of our technological assets were our 12,286 portable IPv4 addresses (which were sold along with the product). We allowed our customers to use our IP addresses to improve the inbox delivery of their email campaigns.
 
During the period of time before the sale of the SMTP product, we employed Message Systems as the backbone of our sending. During the first half of 2016, we also employed Postfix software for certain functions. PostFix software is open source and has been released under the IBM Public License 1.0, giving us and others rights to freely utilize and modify the software at our discretion and without cost. We operated the software in a clean unmodified state. We developed proprietary extensions that plugged into the PostFix software in an effort to optimize the speed at which email is delivered, and to manage the process of maximizing inbox delivery. Customizations to open source software code generally require developers to make their work available at no cost. Since we developed the software by creating extensions which live outside of the open source software layer, we were not required to offer our products or make our source code available.

Our platforms are hosted in third party data centers on equipment that is mostly leased or rented from the provider. During 2016, these providers included Google Compute, Amazon Web Services, Rackspace, Softlayer, Linode, Hetzner and Sadecehosting, Data Realms, Sprocket Networks, MongoHQ, Microsoft Azure, and others. These data centers use a mixture of biometric access controls, redundant power, environmental controls and secure internet connection points to ensure uptime and data security. The Company continuously monitors our services for availability, performance and security. When necessary we send engineers to these third-party providers’ locations to maintain quality control and oversight. We rely on our data center providers to maintain peak operating conditions in their businesses and to quickly address issues related to their service as they arise.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company does not have any patents, and does not have any patents in progress.
 
Our trade secrets include our competencies in marketing automation, web tracking, integrations, workflow and email editing.
 
We registered “SharpSpring” and the related logo and certain other marks as trademarks in the United States and several other jurisdictions.
 
We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “sharpspring”, “sharpspringmailplus”, “graphicmail” and similar variations.
 
Regulation of our Business
 
We must comply with U.S. federal legislation entitled Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM Act, which imposes certain obligations on the senders of commercial emails and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content.
 
The CAN-SPAM Act’s main provisions include:
 

● | prohibiting false or misleading email header information 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | prohibiting the use of deceptive subject lines 
● | ensuring that recipients may, for at least 30 days after an email is sent, opt out of receiving future commercial email messages from the sender, with the opt-out effective within 10 days of the request 
● | requiring that commercial email be identified as a solicitation or advertisement unless the recipient affirmatively assented to receiving the message 
● | requiring that the sender include a valid postal address in the email message 

 
In addition, some states have passed laws regulating commercial email practices that are significantly more punitive and difficult to comply with than the CAN-SPAM Act, particularly Utah and Michigan, which have enacted do-not-email registries listing minors who do not wish to receive unsolicited commercial email that markets certain covered content, such as adult or other harmful products. Some portions of these state laws may not be preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act. Additionally, some foreign jurisdictions, such as Australia, Canada and the European Union, have also enacted laws that regulate sending email, some of which are more restrictive than the CAN-SPAM Act. For example, some foreign laws prohibit sending unsolicited email unless the recipient has provided the sender advance consent to receipt of such email, or in other words has “opted-in” to receiving it.
 
The ability of our customers’ constituents to opt out of receiving commercial emails may minimize the effectiveness of our email marketing product. Moreover, non-compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act carries significant financial penalties. If we were found to be in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, applicable state laws not preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act, or foreign laws regulating the distribution of commercial email, whether as a result of violations by our customers or if we were deemed to be directly subject to and in violation of these requirements, we could be required to pay penalties, which would adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. We also may be required to change one or more aspects of the way we operate our business, which could impair our ability to attract and retain customers or increase our operating costs.

As internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign governments becomes more likely. Our business could be negatively impacted by the application of existing laws and regulations or the enactment of new laws applicable to email communications. The cost to comply with such laws or regulations could be significant and would increase our operating expenses, and we may be unable to pass along those costs to our customers in the form of increased subscription fees. In addition, federal, state and foreign governmental or regulatory agencies may decide to impose taxes on services provided over the Internet or via email. Such taxes could discourage the use of the Internet and email as a means of commercial marketing and communications, which would adversely affect the viability of our services.
 
Additionally, certain aspects of how our customers utilize our platform are subject to regulations in the United States, European Union and elsewhere. In recent years, U.S. and European lawmakers and regulators have expressed concern over the use of third-party cookies or web beacons for online behavioral advertising, and legislation adopted recently in the European Union requires informed consent for the placement of a cookie on a user’s device. Regulation of cookies and web beacons may lead to restrictions on our activities, such as efforts to understand users’ Internet usage. New and expanding “Do Not Track” regulations have recently been enacted or proposed that protect users’ right to choose whether or not to be tracked online. These regulations seek, among other things, to allow end users to have greater control over the use of private information collected online, to forbid the collection or use of online information, to demand a business to comply with their choice to opt out of such collection or use, and to place limits upon the disclosure of information to third party websites. These policies could have a significant impact on the operation of our marketing automation platform and could impair our attractiveness to customers, which would harm our business.
 
Customers and potential customers in the healthcare, financial services and other industries are subject to substantial regulation regarding their collection, use and protection of data and may be the subject of further regulation in the future. Accordingly, these laws or significant new laws or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws, regulations or governmental policy may change the way these customers do business and may require us to implement additional features or offer additional contractual terms to satisfy customer and regulatory requirements, or could cause the demand for and sales of our marketing automation platform to decrease and adversely impact our financial results.
 
Employees
 
As of March 17, 2017, we have approximately 144 people supporting our operations, including approximately 140 employees and 4 contractors. Nearly all of our employees and contractors devote their full effort to the company. Our resources include 38 sales and marketing resources, 29 development resources, 19 general & administrative resources and 58 customer services, network and support resources.
 
None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
 
We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire or acquire and retain qualified employees and contractors. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such resources. If we are unsuccessful in managing the timely delivery of these services our business could be adversely affected. We believe we have good relations with our resources.
 
Properties
 
Our corporate headquarters is a leased facility located in Gainesville, FL. Additionally, we lease a satellite office in Kiev, Ukraine.
 
Financial Information About Segments
 
The Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), which is the Company’s chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s CODM evaluates the Company’s financial information and resources and assess the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.
