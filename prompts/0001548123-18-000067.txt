  Forward-looking Statements
  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act) provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Castle. Castle and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are forward-looking, including statements contained in this Annual Report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and in reports to Castles stockholders. Management believes that all statements that express expectations and projections with respect to future matters, as well as from developments beyond Castles control, including changes in global economic conditions, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. These statements are made on the basis of managements views and assumptions, as of the time the statements are made, regarding future events and business performance. There can be no assurance; however, that managements expectations will necessarily come to pass.
  Factors that may affect forward-looking statements include a wide range of factors that could materially affect future developments and performance, including the following: Changes in company-wide strategies, which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which Castle is involved or chooses to invest; changes in U.S., global or regional economic conditions; changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets; including significant interest and foreign exchange rate fluctuations; which may impede Castles access to, or increase the cost of, external financing for its operations and investments; increased competitive pressures, both domestically and internationally; legal and regulatory developments, such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities; the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions and changes in international tax laws or currency controls; adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes; and labor disputes, which may lead to increased costs or disruption of operations.  This list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward-looking statements are illustrative, but by no means exhaustive. Accordingly, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty.

(the Company, Castle, we, our or us) through its subsidiaries manages luxury and mid-range resort condominiums and hotels on all of the major islands within the state of Hawaii, and a premier property located in New Zealand. The Company was incorporated in Utah on August 21, 1981 and on June 4, 1993 the name of the Company was changed to The Castle Group, Inc.   Principal Products or Services and Their Markets 
  General
  We are a full service hospitality and hotel management company that provides full management services for hotels and condominium resorts. We earn our revenues by providing several types of services to property owners including, hotel and resort management and operations, including staffing; reservations staffing and operations; advertising, sales and marketing; and accounting. Our revenues are derived primarily from the rental and management of hotel rooms and condominium accommodations along with food and beverage sales.    Corporate Culture
  Our corporate culture has been internally branded as F & F, which means Flexibility and Focus.  The organization and infrastructure is solid and designed for maximum flexibility to react to any and all marketplace dynamics, while at the same time, allowing us to remain focused on our objectives and overall strategy without losing focus or perspective.   Marketing Strategy
  Most of our marketing efforts are focused towards acquiring and retaining guests for the properties we manage. We have made investments in three of the properties that we manage, as we own the lobby and food and beverage areas in our New Zealand property, have a minority interest in a property in Hawaii, and a commercial unit which includes the front desk for another property we manage in Hawaii. Sales, advertising and marketing is handled by our centralized sales staff and is done through various distribution channels including direct internet sales, wholesalers, online and traditional travel agencies, corporate and frequent traveler accounts, and group tour operators. We also manage and operate an interactive web site (www.Castleresorts.com) for customers to view information about the properties we manage and make reservations at the properties we represent. Our website offers user friendly navigation, interactive features and rich content, while offering attractive rates and a travel booking engine that can handle rate conversions for over 100 foreign currencies. The proprietary online booking and reservations engine supports a dynamic pricing model which maximizes revenues for all of our properties under management.     4    We support our online presence with a full service, reservation call center that provides a wide range of services from tour reservation processing and rooms control, to handling group bookings. Our reservation center electronically connects resort property inventory and rates to the four major Global Distribution Systems (GDS) and major Online Travel Agencies (OTAs), including vacation rental sites such as Air Bnb and Homeaway. This connectivity displays rates and inventory of our properties to over 500,000 travel agents worldwide as well as providing internet connectivity to over 1,200 travel websites around the globe.   Diversity
  We have a diverse portfolio of properties located in desired island resort destinations in the Pacific Region. We represent hotels, resort condominiums, luxury villas and lodging accommodations throughout Hawaii and in New Zealand.    In Hawaii, we represent properties on the five major Hawaiian Islands of Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Molokai and Hawaii, allowing our customers the option to island-hop which provides us with cross-selling advantages. Our Honolulu headquarters serve as the epicenter for our international operations. Our diverse destinations offer customers the opportunity to discover new experiences and varying cultures in the areas we represent.  We offer a wide range of accommodations at various price points from exclusive private villas, full-service hotels, oceanfront resort condominiums, to modestly priced hotels with up to 286 guest rooms. Our collection of all-suite condominium resorts, hotels, villas, lodges and vacation rentals allows customers to select the best accommodation to suit their individual style and budget.   Our ability to deliver consistent financial returns to our property owners demonstrates Castles competency in managing and marketing a wide range of accommodations to our customers via multiple channels of distribution.   Brand Strategy
  Each property we manage is individually branded in order to extract maximum value from its strengths. The Castle name stays in the background as our focus is on marketing the uniqueness of each property while satisfying the needs and expectations of our owners.  Each property we manage maintains its own brand identity and personality, while utilizing the Castle advantage of our powerful sales and marketing resources, channel distribution, resort management expertise, industry partnerships and networks.  Our brand strategy is one of the areas that clearly differentiates us from the high profile branded hospitality companies. When a hotel owner or developer is considering contracting a large worldwide hospitality company for possible hotel management, there are several considerations that must be assessed. With major worldwide brands usually come the high costs that the owner must bear to sustain the expensive plant, marketing and operational costs that the brand demands in order to fall into the brands cookie cutter image. There are also some tangible differences from the guests or customers perspective. At Castle, we believe that one size and one guest experience model does not fit all and we also believe that marketing efforts should be focused on the individual property with its unique culture instead of concentrating dollars on the advancement of the brand name.  We market each property with its own independent brand identity and deploy customized marketing programs to target the specific demographics attracted to each of our unique properties. Through our property brand building efforts, we begin the process of positioning each of our resorts to our key market segments, niche targeted customers and distribution channels.   We also do not flag our properties with the Castle name. The advantages of doing so are several. There is a high demand for the independent smaller boutique hotels and condominiums, as travelers favor a more individualized and unique travel experience. We believe that this allows the consumer to better choose the specific type of vacation experience desired based upon the specific attributes of the property selected. This ongoing trend towards smaller, independent hotels, as opposed to the familiar mid-range chains has been seen throughout the world tourism marketplace. We have expanded this uniqueness through our online reservation system, which allows guests to view and choose an individual unit should they wish to do so instead of booking a category of room. We believe that property owners who pay for sales and marketing costs should not do so to promote the management company, but rather the properties or individual units that they own.  Marketing Programs and Promotions
  We have implemented numerous marketing programs directed towards both the consumer and trade markets to generate incremental revenue for each of our properties. We have developed a wide range of programs designed specifically to reflect the unique attributes of each of our resort properties (and in some cases the unique attributes of a particular unit), which also includes providing various incentives. We manage a number of marketing programs and promotions, some of which are seasonal to drive incremental room night revenues during valley periods, and some of which are ongoing throughout the year. During the past year we have emphasized programs relating to value travel and vacation rental accommodations as well as increased consumer direct booking at the luxury properties we manage.   Growth Strategy
  The properties we presently manage are located within the state of Hawaii, with one property in New Zealand.    5      We also have subsidiary companies set up in other regions of the Pacific Basin and while we believe that there are significant opportunities in this region, we have chosen to focus on obtaining additional contracts within our current markets due to the opportunities afforded by the sales of properties, foreclosures, underperformance of certain properties, and dissatisfaction with management of other properties by our competitors. Management will explore expansion again into the Asian region when we determine that the economic conditions would make it once again economically feasible to enter these regions.  We have also focused on internal growth at our resort condominium properties and have had some success in growing our rental units managed at some of our properties. We will continue to focus on growing our inventory at our existing properties, in addition to using these properties as a hub to service other units in the immediate area of our rental programs.   As part of our strategy to secure long term, multi-year management contracts, from time to time, we have found it advantageous to purchase or lease selected real property within a resort or condominium project. We have ownership of two common areas in two properties we manage, one in New Zealand and one in Hawaii. The real estate we own includes the areas used to check-in and check-out guests at those properties, providing us with a competitive edge over off-site management companies.   In addition to focusing on growing our portfolio of managed properties, we will continue to focus efforts on securing additional equity ownership interests in properties and/or management companies in both the domestic and international markets.
