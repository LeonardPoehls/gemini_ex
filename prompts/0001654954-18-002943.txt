 ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
  
  Overview
  
 Fusion Telecommunications International, Inc. (“Fusion”), through its various subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”), offers a comprehensive suite of cloud communications, cloud connectivity, cloud infrastructure, cloud computing, and managed cloud-based applications solutions to small, medium and large businesses, and offers domestic and international voice services to telecommunications carriers worldwide. Our advanced, proprietary cloud services platforms, as well as our state-of-the art switching systems, enable the integration of leading edge solutions in the cloud, increasing customer collaboration and productivity by seamlessly connecting employees, partners, customers and vendors. We currently operate our business in two distinct business segments: Business Services and Carrier Services.
  
 In the Business Services segment, we are focused on becoming our business customers’ single source for leveraging the increasing power of the cloud, providing a robust package of what we believe to be the essential services that form the foundation for their successful migration to, and efficient use of, the cloud. Our core Business Services products and services include cloud voice and unified communications as a service (“UCaaS”), improving communications and collaboration on virtually any device, virtually anywhere, and cloud connectivity services, securely and reliably connecting customers to the cloud with managed network solutions that are designed to increase quality and optimize network efficiency. Our cloud computing and infrastructure as a service (“IaaS”) solutions are designed to provide our business customers with a platform on which additional cloud services can be layered. Complemented by our software as a service (“SaaS”) solutions such as security and business continuity, our advanced cloud offerings, including private and hybrid cloud, storage, backup and recovery and secure file sharing that allow our customers to experience the increased efficiencies and agility delivered by the cloud. Fusion’s cloud-based services are flexible, scalable and can be rapidly deployed, reducing our customers’ cost of ownership while increasing their productivity.
  
 Through our Carrier Services segment, we have agreements with approximately 370 carrier customers and vendors and sell our voice services to other communications service providers throughout the world. Customers include U.S.-based carriers sending voice traffic to international destinations, and foreign carriers sending voice traffic to the U.S. and internationally. We also purchase domestic and international voice services from many of our Carrier Services customers. Our carrier-grade network, advanced switching platform and interconnections with global carriers on six continents also reduce the cost of global voice traffic, thereby increasing profitability and expanding the service delivery capabilities for our Business Services segment. Since July 2017, our Carrier Services business has been operated through Fusion Global Services, LLC (“FGS”), which is currently 60% owned by us and 40% owned by XcomIP, LLC (“XComIP”). In connection with the Merger (as defined below), we have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to effectuate, on or prior to the closing of the Merger, to either (i) divest our 60% ownership interest in FGS, or (ii) dissolve FGS. See “Developments in 2017” below.
  
 As a result of the acquisition of a number of cloud services businesses over the past five years, Fusion has expanded its business customer base to over 13,000 customer accounts, increased its distribution network to over 500 active distribution partners and added a significant number of network facilities and points of presence, thus expanding its geographic reach. Through these acquisitions, we acquired advanced systems and infrastructure and augmented our management team and employee base with talented, experienced, well-trained professionals, and further developed a strong platform for further acquisitions.

 Fusion is seeking to capitalize on the rapid growth of the worldwide cloud services market, which is expected to grow at a three-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.5% to total $411.4 billion, up from $260.2 billion in 2017, according to Gartner, Inc. The highest growth is expected to come from cloud system infrastructure as a service, which is projected to grow at a 27.7% CAGR from 2017 to 2020 to reach $72.0 billion, while cloud application services (SaaS) is expected to grow at a 19.4% CAGR from 2017 to 2020 to reach $100.0 billion. We are pursuing a three-tiered growth strategy, consisting of (i) developing specialized solutions for key vertical markets (such as legal and healthcare); (ii) targeting and acquiring additional cloud services companies; and (iii) implementing measures to accelerate organic growth. Our continuing effort to deliver advanced cloud solutions to larger companies with more complex requirements is supported by our proprietary cloud solutions platform that allows us to rapidly respond to large enterprise needs for customized or enhanced solutions. We intend to continue to develop vertically oriented solutions to expand our revenue opportunities and further differentiate our service suite, with current efforts directed primarily on the healthcare, legal, hospitality and real estate verticals. We also intend to acquire additional cloud services companies that can further expand our customer base, allow us to provide additional cloud products and services to our portfolio and gain scale. Our growth strategy for the Business Services segment includes securing large strategic distribution partners, increasing our direct as well as indirect channel sales efforts and upselling solutions to our existing customer base.
  
 Fusion’s management team has extensive experience in the technology, services and communications industry, with demonstrated leadership in middle market, entrepreneurial, small company, distressed and M&A environments. We believe that our executive team has the experience and expertise to drive high value opportunities to the Company and execute on our acquisition and organic growth strategies.
  
 Fusion was incorporated in Delaware and commenced operations in September 1997. We currently have offices in: New York, NY; Fairfield, NJ; Fort Lauderdale, FL; Atlanta, GA; Redondo Beach, CA; Austin, TX; Herndon, VA; and Beachwood, OH.
  
  Developments in 2017
  
 On August 26, 2017, Fusion and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Fusion BCHI Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended (the “Merger Agreement”) with Birch Communications Holdings, Inc., a Georgia corporation (“Birch”). The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, Birch will merge with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”), with Merger Sub surviving the Merger. Birch, through its subsidiaries, provides IP-based communications, cloud and managed services to businesses in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Canada under the Birch and Primus brands. Birch provides voice, broadband, Internet access, hosted services, managed services, wireless voice, wireless data and other communications, cloud and managed services to its customer base comprised of small, midsized, and enterprise businesses.
  
 On the effective date of the Merger, the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Birch (other than treasury shares or shares owned of record by any Birch subsidiary) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, in the aggregate, that number of shares of our common stock equal to three times the number of shares of (i) our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (but excluding the shares of our common stock issued by us in a public offering of our shares of common stock completed in February 2018 as well as certain other issued and outstanding shares of our common stock (see “Recent Amendments to Merger Agreement and East West Bank Waiver” below)), plus (ii) our common stock issued or issuable upon the conversion of all classes or series of our preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, plus (iii) our common stock issuable upon the exercise of all in-the-money Fusion warrants (collectively, the “Merger Shares”). Pursuant to subscription agreements executed by each of the stockholders of Birch, the Merger Shares will be issued in the name of, and held by BCHI Holdings, LLC (“BCHI”), a limited liability company owned by the stockholders of Birch. On the closing date of the Merger, BCHI and Fusion will enter into a Registration Rights Agreement governing the registration rights of BCHI in respect of the Merger Shares and pursuant to which we will agree, among other things, to use our reasonable best efforts to cause a shelf registration statement covering the resale of the Merger Shares to be declared effective by the SEC within 120 days of the closing of the Merger.
  
  Closing of the Merger is subject to numerous conditions, including (i) receipt of the requisite approval of Fusion’s voting shares, which approval was secured by the Company on February 21, 2018, (ii) Fusion obtaining financing for the transaction, which will be used to retire existing senior debt facilities at Birch and Fusion, (iii) all existing shares of our preferred stock being converted into shares of our common stock, and (iii) Fusion using its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger Shares to be approved for listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”), including, if necessary, in order to comply with Nasdaq listing requirements, amending Fusion’s existing certificate of incorporation prior to the effective time of the Merger to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock to satisfy Nasdaq’s minimum pricing requirements (the “Reverse Stock Split”). If the Reverse Stock Split must be completed prior to the closing of the Merger, it will be in a range of up to 5:1, with the final ratio to be determined by our existing board.
  
 In addition, prior to the closing of the Merger, Birch is required to spin-off to the existing Birch shareholders, its US-based consumer business, which consists of (i) the residential customer base, life line and consumer wireless business in the United States, and (ii) its single-line business customer base in the United States. In addition, as discussed above, we have agreed that on or prior to the consummation of the Merger, we will use our reasonable best efforts, on or prior to the closing of the Merger, to either (i) divest our 60% ownership interest in FGS, or (ii) dissolve FGS.

 On the effective date of the Merger, our certificate of incorporation will be amended and restated, which amendments will, among other things, (i) increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock to 150 million and (ii) change our name to “Fusion Connect, Inc.” From and after the effective time of the Merger, the size of our Board will be fixed at seven directors. Three directors, including at least one director who satisfies the Nasdaq listing standard’s independence requirements, will be nominated by a nominating committee comprised of our directors serving on the Board on the date of the nomination and three directors, including at least one that satisfies the Nasdaq listing standard’s independence requirements, will be nominated by BCHI. The seventh director, who must satisfy the Nasdaq listing standard’s independence requirements, will be nominated by BCHI, subject to the reasonable consent of the Fusion committee. Our Chief Executive Officer, Matthew D. Rosen will serve as the post-Merger Chairman of the Board, and Holcombe T. Green, Jr., a principal stockholder of Birch, will serve as the post-Merger Vice Chairman of the Board. Information relating to the post-Merger Fusion Board and its executive officers will be included in a Form 14F-1 to be filed and mailed to all stockholders of the Company no less than 10 days prior to consummation of the Merger. The Merger is currently expected to be completed by mid-April 2018.
  
 The terms of the Merger Agreement are such that the Merger, if consummated, will result in a change in control. As a result, the transaction will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization, with Birch as the acquirer for accounting purposes, and the historical financial statements of Birch (other than the Statements of Stockholders’ Equity) will become the historical financial statements of the Company.
  
  Recent Amendments to the Merger Agreement and East West Bank Waiver
  
  On January 24 and January 25, 2018, the parties to the Merger Agreement entered into a Fourth and Fifth Amendment to the Merger Agreement, respectively. The primary purpose of the Fourth Amendment was to further extend that date by which either Fusion or Birch may terminate the Merger Agreement due to an inability to secure commitments for the required financing from 120 days from the date of the Merger Agreement to 220 days from the date thereof (i.e., April 3, 2018). Under the Fourth Amendment, the parties also agreed to exclude up to 300,000 shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the IQmax, Inc. asset acquisition (as described below) from the calculation of the number of Merger Shares to be issued to BCHI at the closing of the Merger. In addition, the Fourth Amendment also revised Exhibit D to the Merger Agreement (which exhibit described the proposed spin-off of the Birch consumer business required as a condition precedent to the closing) to exclude references to the Canadian business of Birch as the parties have agreed that such assets and customers will transfer to Fusion at the closing of the Merger.
  
  Under the Fifth Amendment to the Merger Agreement, the parties agreed to increase the dollar amount of cash that Fusion could raise by issuing equity or debt securities in connection with capital raising activities prior to the closing of the Merger from $10.0 million to $40.0 million net proceeds) and also agreed that any shares of common stock issued by us in this offering in an amount up to $40.0 million (net proceeds) would be excluded in determining the number of Merger Shares to be issued to BCHI at the closing of the Merger.
  
  On January 26, 2018, we obtained a waiver under our senior secured credit facility with East West Bank (the “East West Bank Credit Facility”) permitting us to sell up to approximately $30.0 million (net proceeds) of our common stock without having to use any of those proceeds to prepay amounts outstanding under that facility (the "January 2018 EWB Waiver"). Prior to receiving the January 2018 EWB Waiver, we were obligated under the East West Bank Credit Facility to use any net proceeds for any sale of our equity securities that are in excess of $4.0 million to pay down outstanding borrowings thereunder. In addition, on February 23, 2018 we obtained an additional waiver under the East West Bank Credit Facility permitting us to retain the entire amount of the net proceeds from the recently completed equity offering.
  
  On March 12, 2018, the parties to the Merger Agreement entered into a Sixth Amendment to the Merger Agreement, the sole purpose of which was to amend the Merger Agreement and the associated form of stockholders agreement to reduce the number of directors that will initially serve on the post-Merger Board from nine to seven.
  
  February 2018 Public Offering of shares of Our Common Stock
  
  On February 5, 2018, we closed an offering of 12,937,500 shares of our common stock, including 1,687,500 shares for which the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full, at a price to the public of $3.20 per share for gross proceeds of $41.4 million. The net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions, but before estimated expenses of the offering payable by Fusion, were $38.7 million. As noted above, the shares sold in this offering will not be counted as issued and outstanding for purposes of calculating the number of shares of Fusion common stock to be issued as consideration to BCHI in connection with the closing of the Merger. As a result, on a post-closing basis, the dilutive effect of this offering will be shared pro rata by current Fusion and Birch shareholders with current Fusion shareholders bearing approximately 25% of the dilution and current Birch shareholders bearing approximately 75% of the dilution from this offering. Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC acted as the sole book-running manager and B. Riley FBR, Inc. acted as a co-manager for the offering

  IQMax Asset Acquisition
  
  On January 24, 2018, Fusion completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of IQMax, Inc. (“IQMax”), a Charlotte, N.C.-based provider of secure messaging, enterprise data integration and advanced cloud communications solutions. The total consideration for this transaction is $1.0 million, which will be paid in shares of our common stock. These shares will remain in escrow until 12 months following the closing of the transaction.
 Historical Acquisitions
  
 The cloud services marketplace continues to be fragmented, with many providers challenged by a limited product portfolio, a lack of financial and operational resources and a regional focus. Fusion believes this market segment offers strong opportunities for consolidation. We believe that the cross-marketing opportunities and economies of scale made possible through consolidation make such acquisitions an attractive vehicle to enhance our growth profile.
  
 Fusion integrates the businesses it acquires and organizes the employees under one management team. Products and services and processes and procedures are rapidly integrated as well, while sales and support staff and distribution partners are trained to cross and up-sell our solutions to our existing and acquired customer bases. We believe that our integration strategy, in combination with our increasing expertise and our scalable, robust systems and infrastructure, will enable us to continue to efficiently integrate Birch and additional acquisitions in the future.
  
 Since 2012, we have made the following acquisitions:
  
  NBS
 
 In October 2012, we acquired Network Billing Systems, LLC, and certain assets and liabilities of its affiliate, Interconnect Services Group II LLC (collectively, “NBS”), a cloud services provider delivering cloud voice and UCaaS, cloud connectivity and managed network services to small, medium and large businesses nationwide.
 Broadvox Cloud Services Business
 
 In December 2013, we acquired certain assets of Broadvox LLC’s cloud services business, which delivered cloud-based voice, UCaaS and cloud connectivity services to small, medium and large businesses.
  
  PingTone

  Business Services
  
 Our cloud-based services are designed to meet the communications, network and computing requirements of growing businesses, while maximizing the price-performance ratio. We believe that giving our customers access to the cloud provides a more cost-effective, reliable and secure communications and IT experience, and relieves them of the capital and support burdens associated with more traditional premise-based services. Additionally, customers can reduce costs while adding features and functionality and improving productivity across their company. Fusion is increasingly focused on providing specialized, market-based solutions to targeted verticals and larger enterprises, matching our advanced solutions to key industry-specific customer requirements.
  
 We currently have over 13,000 business customer accounts. We offer a suite of advanced cloud-based services, including cloud communications, which encompasses cloud voice and UCaaS, and cloud connectivity that provides diverse and redundant access to the cloud. The Company’s managed network services converge voice and data applications, which include Internet access, Ethernet over Copper transmission facilities and Multi-Protocol Level Switching (“MPLS”) services at speeds ranging from 1.5 Mbps to 100 Gbps. Our cloud computing solutions include private and hybrid cloud, storage, backup and recovery and secure file sharing. Security and business continuity are offered as part of every solution.
  
 Fusion’s services are designed to provide significant benefits to businesses of all sizes, with single or multiple locations. The integration of cloud solutions on our advanced services platforms allow customers to seamlessly connect people with the information they need to collaborate effectively, regardless of the device they use.
  
 Our cloud solutions are also designed to minimize upfront capital costs, increase the scalability and flexibility of the customer’s communications network and service environment, provide robust features and functionality to increase productivity and reduce the overall cost of communications.
  
 Our proprietary cloud communications service platform allows us to rapidly respond to market requirements for new or enhanced products and services, as well as customize customer solutions as required for maximum flexibility, avoiding costly licensing fees and increasing our control over the service environment. Fusion’s growing suite of business services includes:
  
  Cloud Voice
 
 Fusion’s cloud voice service allows a customer to replace its owned or leased premise-based office telephone system with a state-of-the-art cloud-based digital telephone system. This feature-rich solution eliminates the need to own and operate a costly, complex telephone system, reduces upfront capital costs, and eliminates the cost of calls between customer locations. The service provides efficiencies for companies with multiple offices or a highly mobile workforce, and for companies that are opening a new office or need to expand or replace existing legacy telephone systems. All business service options can be configured by the user in real time using a powerful administrative portal, virtually eliminating the costs associated with the labor-intensive reconfiguration of on-site telephone systems. Our contact center solutions provide advanced call center features and functionality that can be seamlessly integrated with our cloud voice solutions, reducing operational costs and increasing cost savings and efficiency. CRM integration, call recording and real-time monitoring are built into the contact center solution, increasing productivity without increasing costs.
 Unified Communications
 
 Our UCaaS offering complements our cloud voice solutions with integrated service features that seamlessly combine audio, video, messaging and web services, immediately connecting people with the information they need to communicate effectively. Our integrated cloud-based UCaaS collaboration suite is device and location agnostic, allowing businesses of all sizes to increase productivity by simplifying communication over the most preferred or available device. By connecting employees with other employees and customers via conference call or online meeting, and sharing documents real-time with a simple click, our UCaaS solution drives efficiencies while at the same time reducing costs.
 Contact Center
 
 Fusion’s cloud-based, enterprise contact center offering is fully integrated with our UCaaS solution on our proprietary cloud services platform. Converging voice, data, web and mobile technologies, it enables customers to extend the features and functionality of the contact center throughout the enterprise while providing device and media-agnostic UCaaS services to the contact center. Comprising a full range of cost-effective applications once reserved for the largest enterprises through costly premise-based solutions, our cloud-based contact center offering delivers comprehensive, real-time and historical reporting, database integration (CRM, ERP, etc.), enhanced criteria-based routing and customer-controlled administration. Fusion’s contact center solution protects technology investments by providing a seamless migration path to the cloud, delivering everything a customer needs to monitor, maintain and manage a successful cloud-based contact center environment.

  SIP Trunking
 
 Fusion’s SIP trunking solution allows a customer to retain and use its existing telephone system, while connecting to the Fusion network for access to the cloud, as well as its local services and inbound/outbound domestic and international long distance services. Our SIP trunks efficiently and economically provide businesses with voice channels in any configuration (analog, T-1, PRI, or SIP). Customers save on their local, long distance, and international call charges, eliminate traditional line charges, and gain many of the advantages of cloud voice features and functionality, such as advanced call handling and out-of-area number portability. Burstable voice lines accommodate seasonal traffic fluctuations, marketing campaigns and business continuity requirements. SIP trunks also eliminate the cost of interoffice calling, and allow customers to combine their voice and data traffic onto a single broadband access facility for further cost savings, without having to abandon their existing technology investment. Fusion’s SIP trunking solution can be shared across customer locations and is enhanced by a proprietary administrative portal, which allows customers to alter call routing in real time and provides increased efficiency and control.
  
  Cloud Connectivity
 
 Fusion’s reliable and secure connections to the cloud ensure high levels of service quality and control. Leveraging our own expanding on-net network, as well as our relationships with U.S.-based and international carriers, we offer business customers a full complement of redundant, flexible and scalable network solutions, offering true diversity for built-in business continuity. Services range from dedicated circuits to high-speed broadband that are available in a variety of bandwidth levels. Fusion offers reliable, secure and cost-effective Internet access, as well as Ethernet and MPLS services. We also provide cloud-delivered SD-WAN services that facilitate optimized access for businesses to cloud services, private data centers and enterprise applications simultaneously over both ordinary broadband Internet and private links. Fusion’s quality of service routers seek to provide the highest quality voice traffic while reducing customer access costs. We believe that in addition to providing secure migration and connection to the cloud, providing a full complement of network services allows us to address a broader set of customer needs, delivering increased value and securing customer loyalty in the process.
 Cloud Computing
 
 Fusion’s cloud computing service centralizes information management, hardware, network and infrastructure in an off-premise location that is hosted and managed by Fusion. Offered as private or hybrid solutions, Fusion’s secure offerings drive efficiencies in both costs and resources allowing for rapid scalability and deployment of applications. These offerings provide a predictable, utility-based OpEx model, which eliminates significant capital expenditures, removes obsolescence concerns and future-proofs customer investments.
  
  Managed Applications in the Cloud
 
 Fusion offers several advanced, industry-specific SaaS solutions to meet the needs of large enterprises in key vertical markets, especially those facing the rigorous demands of regulatory requirements and/or the need to store, secure and move large amounts of customer or patient data. We believe that these applications represent significant future revenue potential, as we continue to introduce them to our existing enterprise customers and prospects.
  
  Cloud Security: Unified Threat Management (UTM)
 
 Fusion’s scalable, comprehensive and fully integrated UTM solution secures enterprise data as well as the network on which it is stored, moved or retrieved. The Fusion firewall is application, policy and permission- defined, enabling customers to exercise control over their own security environments. Continuous monitoring and alerts help detect, deter and defeat cyberattacks to mitigate against business disruptions, and malware threats are eliminated with antivirus and antispyware applications designed to maintain the highest level of security against external intrusions. Centrally managed and without requiring a dedicated Internet gateway or firewall on site, the cloud-based solution drives efficiencies in network management and staffing, detecting and blocking unwanted traffic before it impacts the network.
  
  Cloud-Based Storage
 
 Fusion offers a solution that addresses the explosive growth of data across all industries with a cost-effective and secure storage solution hosted in the cloud. This scalable, fully redundant solution is hosted off-premise, reduces customer data center footprints and resource requirements, and facilitates additional SaaS solutions that can be accommodated on the same cloud platform. Fusion delivers a storage and data back-up assessment service as part of its storage offering, measuring growth and duplication benchmarked against best practices. The solution consolidates requirements across the enterprise, increases efficiency and achieves economies of scale designed to reduce overall customer costs.

  Backup and Recovery
 
 Our “Backup and Recovery” is an enterprise-grade backup software solution that provides a single, integrated approach to data protection. Its comprehensive suite of tools and capabilities allow businesses to securely protect more data while using less network capacity and fewer storage resources without having to deploy multiple point solutions.
 Secure File Sharing
 
 Fusion offers a file sharing solution that allows businesses to share, sync and transfer important data across multiple platforms, while keeping security a main priority with military grade encryption. The solution delivers file access from any location, on any device to enable flexible and scalable file sharing, restoration and collaboration.
 Secure Mobile Messaging and Data Integration
 
 Our mobile software solutions seamlessly integrate and transmit messaging and other information across diverse applications and platforms in a secure, compliant manner to improve workforce coordination and collaboration. Our powerful data integration platform advances the expansion of our cloud ecosystem, facilitating its integration with a wide range of applications and business productivity software platforms.
 Service Plans
 
 Fusion offers several different service packages designed to meet specific customer requirements. Base level plans offer a basic service package for a low monthly recurring charge (“MRC”). Additional charges, such as local, long distance, or international calling, are charged at per minute rates. Other packages may include a specific number of local or long distance minutes or even unlimited local or long distance calling. Optional value-added features for basic services are available for an incremental monthly charge appropriate for the service.
  
 Cloud connectivity services such as Internet access services and/or private line services are charged on a fixed monthly basis, and are generally based on the bandwidth utilized and the endpoints involved. Cloud computing services are generally composed of an upfront charge and an MRC. Fusion’s contracts with its Business Services customers range from one to five years in length.
  
  Carrier Services
  
 Fusion’s Carrier Services segment, which is currently operated through FGS, provides voice traffic termination employing primarily VoIP technology. This traffic typically consists of minutes of domestic and international long distance usage that are terminated to telephone numbers in the intended destination countries. The majority of this traffic is international in nature, and terminates to virtually all countries.
  
 We employ least cost routing technology and systems in connection with all of our voice termination services to ensure high quality termination at the lowest possible cost, thus maximizing profit on that traffic. Using least cost routing technology, Fusion often “blends” routes to provide our customers with the optimal mix of price and quality, or to meet unique customer requirements for the termination of voice traffic to specific countries. We also leverage the termination capacity of the Carrier Business segment obtained through interconnection agreements and other methods of termination to carry international traffic generated by our Business Services segment.
  
 All carrier voice services are priced on a per minute basis, based upon the destination called, the time of day and the customer’s overall traffic volume. FGS has reciprocal service agreements with the majority of its carrier customers, and the pricing in those agreements may also reflect the pricing provided to FGS for terminating its traffic. Prices for Internet access or private line service provided to carriers, as well as pricing for co-location services, are based on a fixed MRC for the services provided. FGS has contracts with most of its carrier customers, which typically have a one-year renewable term, no minimum commitments, and allow either party to terminate the arrangement without penalty.
  
  Network
  
 Fusion operates a robust and reliable carrier-grade network and infrastructure that delivers high quality, diverse and secure connections to our cloud services. Our Managed Network Services, Internet access, Ethernet, MPLS and cloud communications solutions can be provided either on-net leveraging our own extensive network, or off-net using the networks of our carrier partners, for truly diverse and redundant connections.

 Each of the Business Services network operations centers (“NOC”), as well as the NOC maintained by FGS, are manned 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and employ state-of-the-art monitoring and alert systems that are designed to ensure quality of service and a proactive response to potential customer service issues.
  
 Our carrier-class network employs digitized, packet-switched service platforms capable of interfacing with most Internet protocols, as well as with TDM (time division multiplexing) or circuit-switched systems, and provides the flexibility necessary to seamlessly transport our customers’ voice and data traffic throughout the United States and the world. Internet access is delivered through dedicated and redundant high-speed interconnections to all major Internet backbones.
  
 The Fusion network is characterized by its low cost of deployment and low recurring costs. It has been constructed to meet actual, rather than anticipated, customer demand with on-net and off-net connections to provide ubiquitous access, delivering maximum cost efficiency without sacrificing quality. This robust network allows us to provide diverse and redundant network connections with seamless automatic failover. Our major points of presence include: New York City; Newark, NJ; Philadelphia, PA; Boston, MA; Atlanta, GA; Miami, FL; Cleveland, OH; Chicago, IL; Dallas, TX; Los Angeles, CA; Washington, D.C.; San Jose, CA; Charlotte, NC; Jacksonville, FL; Columbus, OH; and Little Ferry, NJ.
  
 Key elements of our network include a proprietary cloud communications platform, a BroadSoft cloud communications services platform; Cisco routers and switches, and Acme Packet and Sonus communications services platforms. These redundant network elements are interconnected via a dedicated fiber-based gigabit Ethernet backbone. Most network elements are based on software applications that execute entirely on off-the-shelf servers and are built for easy and rapid deployment and scalability, as well as security and reliability. Fusion has deployed a Global Convergence Solutions routing and rating management solution that has improved routing, rating and invoicing capabilities, facilitated cost savings through overhead reduction and driven efficiencies in route management.
  
 Fusion’s centralized network elements are housed in carrier-grade switching facilities located in secure carrier buildings that house many other carriers and are interconnected to other major carrier buildings. These locations allow for cost-effective and rapid interconnection and capacity expansion to carrier customers, as well as major enterprise customers. Fusion believes its facility locations and equipment choices provide the platform required to support its envisioned growth and will allow it to quickly embrace emerging technologies as they become commercially available and viable.
  
  Proprietary Cloud Services Platform
  
 Our proprietary cloud services platform was designed and developed over many years by our own team of experienced developers using advanced, yet proven, technology. This proprietary platform is scalable, flexible and secure, delivering an integrated portfolio of cloud-based communications services that enable businesses of every size to increase productivity and efficiency while controlling costs. Information management, hardware, network and infrastructure are centralized off-premise, hosted and managed by Fusion, allowing customers to rapidly adjust to fluctuating and unpredictable service demands, drive efficiencies in staff and space, and eliminate the need for costly technology upgrades. The architecture of our proprietary platform has been designed to allow for the seamless integration of additional cloud-based applications, whether or not developed by Fusion. Not subject to third party end user licensing fees or technology release constraints, our proprietary platform allows faster, easier and more cost-effective introduction of new, business-critical applications, delivering a unique feature set engineered to quickly respond to customer demands and market requirements. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by combining our robust carrier-grade network services to enable secure connections to the cloud, delivering true diversity and a fully integrated solution for maximum efficiency and cost savings.
  
 Our proprietary platform has been designed using advanced technologies and best of breed equipment and provides for geographical diversity and redundancy. The platform has been designed for scalability as well as resiliency, and can be easily expanded to accommodate any required number of connections and customers. Platform solutions are location and device neutral, serving multiple as well as single locations nationwide, connecting users to customers and other employees on desktops, laptops, handsets, tablets and mobile phones, wherever they may be located. The platform is currently deployed in two diverse Tier 1 carrier data centers, and such platform has a fully functional, redundant system whose databases are constantly in sync. Thus, should one of the data centers be hit with a catastrophic event, customers should experience no interruption of service. The result is to ensure proven, reliable and consistent uptime performance, which is crucial for delivering mission critical solutions.
  
 Developed with experienced in-house programmers, the platform requires no ongoing licensing fees for individual seats or SIP sessions, which we believe gives Fusion a competitive advantage against many other service providers. Written in current programming languages and utilizing proven technologies, the system enjoys efficiencies and capabilities not found in older legacy type platforms.

  Sales and Marketing
  
 We market and sell our business services to small, medium and large customers through distribution partners, direct sales personnel and inside sales representatives. Our independent distribution partners are typically paid commissions based on their sales and, thereafter, the continued use of our services by the respective customers. Our sales employees, including direct sales and inside sales, are typically compensated through a combination of base salary and commissions based on their actual sales performance.
  
 Our distribution partners generally target small-to medium-size businesses, while our direct sales force focuses on the larger enterprise customers in our targeted verticals. We believe that our cloud platform, infrastructure, systems and connectivity provide a strong competitive advantage in serving these larger enterprise customers, creating real value with specialized solutions that meet their more complex and rigorous requirements. Referrals, strategic relationships and the strength of our corporate relationships are also a key part of our overall sales and marketing plan. Our carrier services are sold entirely through our direct sales force.
  
  Strategy
  
 Our past acquisitions have been, and the Merger with Birch will be, important milestones in our strategic roadmap as we work to become one of the industry’s leading and most successful cloud services providers. Our plans for growth are supported by an experienced and tested management team and dedicated staff, as well as our advanced cloud strategy to organically grow our revenue from the Business Services segment and to continue to develop vertically oriented solutions and acquire additional cloud services companies.
  
 Fusion intends to continue to grow organically through direct as well as indirect channel sales efforts; by securing large strategic distribution partners to extend our geographic and vertical market reach; and through the up-sale and cross-sale of services to our existing customer base.
  
 We also continue to focus our sales and marketing efforts on developing vertically oriented solutions for targeted markets that require the kind of specialized solutions made possible by our state-of-the-art networks and advanced services platforms. Our vertically oriented solutions, which are currently focused on healthcare, legal services, hospitality and real estate, offer a substantial opportunity to gain market share.
  
 Fusion intends to build on the success of its past acquisitions through additional acquisitions of other cloud services companies, such as Birch. We believe that the experience gained in integrating people, products, systems, platforms and customers positions us well to advance our growth. We continue to look to acquire other companies that can expand our customer base and distribution capability, add additional cloud-based products and services and help us increase the scale of our operations.
  
  Intellectual Property and Trademarks
  
 We have several trademarks and service marks, which are supported by a combination of common law and statutory protection. We also own numerous domain names, which have been registered with the Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. The following trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office; however, except as otherwise noted, they are not registered at the international level:
  
  ●
  Fusion®

 
  ●
  Fusion (Logo)®

 
  ●
  Clear Connections in the Cloud®

 
  ●
  Apptix® (also registered with the European Community)

 
  ●
  Cloud Alliance Network & Design®

 
  ●
  Mailstreet®

 
 The telecommunications and VoIP markets have been characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Litigation, which could result in substantial cost and diversion of our efforts, may be necessary to enforce trademarks and/or service marks issued to us or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property or defend ourselves against third-party claims of infringement can be time consuming and costly. Adverse determinations in any litigation or interference proceeding could subject us to costs related to changing names, a loss of established brand recognition, or the need to change the technologies utilized in our services.

  Competition
  
 Each of Fusion’s business segments are highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and subject to constant technological change. In each of our business segments, we compete with companies that are significantly larger and have substantially greater market presence, financial, technical, operational and marketing resources than we do. In the event that such a competitor expends significant sales and marketing resources in one or several markets where we compete with them, we may not be able to compete successfully in those markets. Specialized cloud services providers, who focus on one or more cloud services or applications, could adopt aggressive pricing and promotion practices that could impact our ability to compete. We also believe that competition will continue to increase, placing downward pressure on prices. Such pressure could adversely affect our gross margins if we are not able to reduce our costs commensurate with the price reductions of our competitors. Further, the pace of technological change makes it impossible for us to predict whether we will face new competitors using different technologies to provide the same or similar services offered or proposed to be offered by us. If our competitors were to provide better and more cost effective services than ours, we may not be able to increase our revenues or capture any significant market share.
 Government Regulation
  
 In the United States, our services are generally subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local regulation, including regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) and various state public utility commissions or public service commissions. We may also be subject to similar regulation by foreign governments and their telecommunications/regulatory agencies. While these regulatory agencies grant us the authority to operate our business, they typically exercise minimal control over our services and pricing. However, they do require the filing of various reports, compliance with public safety and consumer protection standards and the payment of certain regulatory fees and assessments.
  
 We cannot provide assurance that the U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies exercising jurisdiction over us will grant us the required authority to operate, will allow us to maintain existing authority so we can continue to operate, or will refrain from taking action against us if we are found to have provided services without obtaining the necessary authority. Similarly, if our pricing and/or terms or conditions of service are not properly filed or updated with the applicable agencies, or if we are otherwise not fully compliant with the rules of the various regulatory agencies, regulators or other third parties could challenge our actions and we could be subject to forfeiture of our authority to provide service, or to penalties, fines, fees or other costs.
  
 As a carrier, Fusion and FGS are subject to FCC regulation under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Fusion and FGS each have the necessary authority under Section 214 of the Communications Act to operate as a domestic and international carrier. Generally, international carrier traffic is subject to minimal regulation by state and local jurisdictions. Fusion also holds various state licenses authorizing us to provide intrastate services to our carrier and end-user customers, and we comply with state reporting, fee payment, tariffing, and other obligations with respect to these services. Should we fail at any time to hold the licenses required to provide our intrastate services, we could be subject to fines and/or other penalties.
  
 Our VoIP services are lightly regulated, although certain traditional telecommunications regulations have been applied to VoIP services. The FCC requires interconnected VoIP services to comply with: 911 emergency service requirements; registration requirements; Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement requirements; obligations to support Universal Service including the Universal Service Fund (“USF”) and Telecommunications Relay Services, the North American Numbering Plan Administration, and Local Number Portability Administration; Customer Proprietary Network Information requirements; disability access obligations; Local Number Portability requirements; service discontinuance notification obligations; outage reporting requirements; and rural call completion reporting and rules related to ring signal integrity. The FCC defines interconnected VoIP service as service that (1) enables real-time, two-way voice communications, (2) requires a broadband connection from the user’s location, (3) requires Internet protocol compatible customer premises equipment, and (4) permits users generally to receive calls that originate on the public switched telephone network (“PSTN”) and to terminate calls to the PSTN. Under this definition, Fusion is a provider of interconnected VoIP service. We believe that our services are currently compliant with all applicable FCC requirements, and we and FGS have made and are making the required contributions to USF and other funds. Should either Fusion or FGS fail to meet any of the FCC requirements discussed above or fail to make required contributions in the future, we could be subject to revocation of our authority to operate or to fines and/or penalties.
  
 As a result of the FCC’s preemption of states’ ability to regulate certain aspects of VoIP service, and a trend in state legislatures to affirmatively deregulate VoIP services for most purposes, our VoIP services are subject to relatively few state regulatory requirements aside from collection of state and local E911 fees and state Universal Service support obligations. We believe that our VoIP services are currently compliant with all applicable state requirements, and we have made and are making the required contributions to E911, state USF, and other funds. The state regulatory framework for our VoIP services continues to evolve, so we, in conjunction with our professional advisors, monitor the actions of the various state regulatory agencies and endeavor to ensure that we are in compliance with applicable state law, including any new statutes or regulations that may be passed. However, there can be no assurance that we will become aware of all applicable requirements on a timely basis, or that we will always be fully compliant with applicable rules and regulations. Should we fail to be compliant with applicable state regulations, or to file required reports with state regulatory agencies, we could be subject to fines and/or penalties.

 While we believe VoIP services may be subject to additional federal, state, local, or international regulation in the future, it’s uncertain when or how the effects of such regulation could affect us and our business. If additional regulation does occur, it is possible that such regulatory agencies may impose surcharges, taxes or regulatory fees on VoIP service providers. The imposition of any such surcharges, taxes, or regulatory fees could increase the Company’s costs and thus reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage that we might enjoy today.
  
  Employees

 Customer Concentrations and Revenues and Assets by Geographic Area
  
 For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenues or accounts receivable.
  
 During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, 91.8% and 89.5%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue was derived from customers in the United States and 8.2 % and 10.5%, respectively, was derived from international customers. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had no assets located outside of the United States.
