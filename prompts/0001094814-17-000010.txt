ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL

Cartesian (f/k/a The Management Network Group, Inc.), a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1990 and is a leading specialist provider of consulting services and managed solutions to the global leaders in the communications, digital media, and technology sectors. We offer a portfolio of strategy, management, marketing, operational, and technology consulting services to help our clients build and execute strategies that transform their products, services and organizations and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of their business operations. We have consulting experience in virtually every major aspect of managing and operating a global communications company. Our heritage of industry knowledge and deep technical and operational expertise has allowed us to continually enhance services we offer to our clients. In this way, our clients can leverage our expertise to optimize their performance, improve cash flow and gain sustainable competitive advantage in the market.

Our clientele includes leaders in the communications, digital media and technology industries. We serve wireless and wireline service providers, cable multiple systems operators (“MSO’s”) as well as technology companies, media and entertainment companies, and financial services firms that invest in the communications industry. Our clients are principally located in the United States, United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and continental Western Europe.

We believe we are unique in our ability to provide a comprehensive business and technology solution to meet our clients’ diverse needs, including: researching and assessing new opportunities; developing and launching new products; improving customer acquisition and retention; optimizing product profitability; enhancing business operations; assuring the delivery of critical programs; network transformation; strategic planning; advising on investments, mergers and acquisitions; and legal and regulatory support.

Our services are provided by a blend of experienced senior professionals from the communications industry and professionals recruited from both universities and other professional services firms. We believe our clients value our unbiased approach of providing technology-agnostic and vendor-neutral evaluations and recommendations that are based on a thorough knowledge of each solution and each client's unique situation. In doing so, we are able to capitalize on our extensive experience across complex multi-technology communications systems environments to provide what we believe are the most sound and practical recommendations to our clients.

We have evolved our business from its original focus of providing primarily management and operational consulting services to today providing a portfolio of consulting services and managed solutions. We have increased the depth and breadth of skill sets in our employee work base, diversified our technical competencies, expanded our core management consulting offerings and positioned our business to compete internationally.

We have strengthened Cartesian's technology consultancy services and broadened our managed analytics solutions through our Ascertain® software. Ascertain is an innovative and modular software suite whose foundations feature advanced revenue assurance and data integrity tools that when customized and integrated into client environments support fixed, wireless, internet service provider (“ISP”), data and content environments. Ascertain reflects an intellectual property investment of over 16 years and we are refining and reinventing the software to address existing and future challenges. We are investing further in defining our go-to-market offerings that are built with technology at the core.

In July 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Farncombe France SARL and Farncombe Technology Limited (collectively, the “Farncombe Entities”). The Farncombe Entities operate primarily in the U.K. and Europe and are in the business of providing strategic consultancy, content security, testing and implementation services for broadcast and broadband internet digital television. The leaders and consultants of the Farncombe Entities are known experts in video, digital rights, content and security across multiple platforms, including broadcast, mobile and broadband networks. In addition to serving a complementary client base, the Farncombe Entities position Cartesian to support the growing digital TV needs of communications service providers. The Farncombe Entities provide cross-selling and upselling opportunities across our combined customer base, particularly in strategy and analytics. The global payTV market exceeds more than $250 billion annually and continues to grow steadily. Convergence of content across digital media platforms is increasingly important in markets across the globe. Ensuring a high quality, seamless viewing experience along with the security of content is a requirement to compete effectively. Farncombe’s experience in these areas along with Cartesian’s strategic, operational and technical capabilities in serving global service providers strengthens our ability to support convergence and quad play offerings in this growing market.

As the industry continues to evolve, including the recent transformational movement of business IT infrastructures to cloud environments and the development of technologies for analyzing “Big Data”, Cartesian expects to leverage its long history of engagement experience with clients to continue to evolve its software, develop new methodologies, and selectively expand its base of employee consultants.

Strategic alliance partnerships are an element of our strategy. In 2014, we entered into a strategic alliance and Investment Agreement with Elutions, Inc. (“Elutions”), a provider of operational business intelligence solutions. With regard to the commercial relationship, Elutions is a provider of smart building and smart asset management solutions for energy management. In the partnership with Elutions, Cartesian may provide: lead generation to Elutions, sales and marketing support and program management. For additional information regarding the alliance and transaction with Elutions, see Note 3, Strategic Alliance and Investment by Elutions, Inc., in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Consolidated Financial Statements", of this report.
MARKET OVERVIEW

The global communications industry continues to evolve rapidly, driven by constant innovation in technology and business models. Convergence has broken down the traditional barriers between telecommunications, Internet, media and entertainment creating new competitive pressures for service providers. Innovation in mobile devices, consumer electronics and online services has brought new competitors into the market, such as Apple, Google, Facebook and Netflix. These dynamics are challenging existing industry competitors to explore new business models, and driving consolidation within sectors such as traditional wireline and wireless telecommunications. In addition, cable communications companies that primarily offered video services historically are now positioning themselves as providers of voice and other data and content services, including in the emerging area of “the Connected Home” and “the Internet of Things.” Wireline, wireless and cable companies alike are focused on convergence and partnering - where any type of content or application can be delivered seamlessly across fixed or mobile networks.

While communications companies are investing in future growth, companies across most industries and sectors, including communications and media, are operating with increased expense discipline. Many firms are reducing their cost structures through actions which include lowering total headcount, decreasing information technology expenses by migrating to cloud environments, and leveraging data to gain insight into operations and potential efficiency gains. In addition, the industry we serve is experiencing rapid consolidation, creating opportunities and challenges as budgets shift toward integration programs. Spending decisions, both operating expenses and capital expenditures, are coming under increased scrutiny with a heightened focus on a demonstrated return on investment or lower total cost.

It has been our experience that because the expertise necessary to address the needs of the changing marketplace is typically outside communications companies’ core competencies, they must ultimately either recruit and employ talent with the necessary experience or retain outside specialists. Additionally, the convergence of the communications, media and entertainment industries has expanded the breadth of experience and skill sets needed to execute new business plans. We believe due to the range of expertise required and the time and expense associated with hiring and training new personnel, bringing expertise in-house is often not a viable option. We believe customers will continue to contract with consultative firms or outsource some of the expertise required to adapt to new environments and capitalize on new technologies now emerging, while maintaining a cost effective structure. When retaining outside specialists, we believe communications companies need experts who fully understand the communications industry and can provide timely and unbiased advice and recommendations for cost-effective solutions and expense avoidance. Cartesian has positioned its business to respond to these anticipated needs.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

Our objectives are three-fold. First, is to establish ourselves as the consulting company of choice to the global leaders in the communications, digital media, and technology industries, which includes the service providers, content creators, and technology companies that serve the industry and the financial services and investment banking firms that invest in the sector. We are placing emphasis on cultivating our top client relationships and these clients’ most strategic initiatives, with the goal of expanding market penetration and our share of business with these clients. We also continue to investigate opportunities with new clients, including segments of the market we have not historically addressed but that may offer a high probability of a return on our business development investment. Secondly, we are evaluating ways to best evolve our technical and consulting offerings to focus on those that exhibit the greatest differentiation to our competitors and to broaden our offering in areas of long-term strategic importance to our customers; and third we look to develop partnerships as appropriate to add capabilities to our offering or expedite our go-to-market efforts. The following are detailed strategies we have adopted to pursue our objectives.

- Develop and evolve offerings, technical solutions and thought leadership

We plan to continue developing our portfolio of consulting services and managed solutions both organically and through alliance partners. Developing our portfolio involves building the capabilities that address our clients’ most pressing needs.

- Recruit and retain high quality professionals

We believe a key element of our business model is the attraction and retention of high quality, experienced consultants. Our two primary challenges in the recruitment of new consulting personnel are the ability to recruit talented personnel with the skill sets necessary to capitalize on an industry undergoing revolutionary change and the ability to execute such recruitment with an appropriate compensation arrangement.

We enhance consultants' existing skill sets with proprietary toolsets that provide methodologies that augment their experience and help them to analyze and solve clients' problems. We utilize a network of databases to serve as a knowledge base, enabling consultant collaboration on engagements and providing support information and updates of Cartesian current toolsets and releases of next generation tools. Finally, we continue to manage our flexible employee and independent subject matter expert model to maximize skill set offerings, while minimizing the effect of non-billable consultant time.

- Enhance our geographic presence

We plan to further enhance our presence beyond the United States, the U.K., and France with emphasis on the top revenue generating clients on the European continent. We believe the competitive market expertise of our U.S. consultants can be a key factor for foreign companies facing the business issues associated with deregulation and competition, especially in Europe. Further, consolidation in the industries we serve has resulted in several of our customers expanding their reach into new markets, making those markets more readily accessible to us than in the past. We believe our technical solutions and our strategy consulting expertise strengthen Cartesian's presence and capabilities in new markets.

- Increase penetration within top revenue-generating clients

Our sales strategy focuses on increasing the amount of revenues and number of engagements within our top clients. This approach includes volume pricing arrangements and is designed to give us both revenue visibility and add efficiency to the model so as to ensure optimum utilization of our consultant base. In fiscal years 2016 and 2015, 77% and 87% of our revenues, respectively, came from our ten most significant customers.

SERVICES

Cartesian provides a portfolio of consulting services and managed solutions to clients in the communications, media and technology industries worldwide. Our services include:

We provide a breadth of marketing services to support our clients from strategy, to planning, through execution. Our deep understanding of the global communications environment and our creative and rigorous analytic techniques enable us to craft winning marketing strategies and programs for our clients. We see individual business issues in the context of overall industry financial and value relationships, allowing us to deliver detailed, focused and pragmatic recommendations and blueprints for sustainable impact and change. We provide program management and project delivery to support execution across the broad spectrum of marketing services such as Customer Segmentation, Customer Experience Assessment, Product Management, Retail Sales Channel Assessment and Marketing Communications.

- Revenue and Cost Management

Revenue management is now evolving into a proactive discipline covering cost reduction and optimization as well as profitability enhancement. Cartesian applies its robust revenue management methodologies to all phases of the service activation and revenue processes and approaches revenue assurance from an end-to-end, order-to-cash perspective. Proprietary toolsets, combined with in-depth operational expertise and a track record of success have proven to be the winning formula to enable our clients to generate significant cash flow improvements.

As mentioned, Cartesian’s revenue assurance assessment tools include Ascertain, a flexible, scalable, configurable revenue management and data integrity toolset that provides timely evaluation of processes, metrics and control points. A fifth generation platform developed by the revenue assurance experts at Cartesian, Ascertain is able to support fixed, wireless, ISP, data, and content environments.

- Technology Solutions

We have developed a proprietary software platform, Ascertain, which allows us to rapidly create new software products, one-off tools and complete custom solutions to support customer goals and mitigate risks in their business. Available in an on-premise or cloud-based model, the Ascertain platform has been used as the foundation for our managed solutions offerings, our SmartXchange mobile device recapture service, as well as numerous custom client solutions. Our SmartXchange service is a fully-managed service for the collection, exchange and recycling of mobile devices.
- Investment Advisory Services

We provide a wide range of services to investment banking and private equity firms in connection with investments, mergers and acquisitions in the communications industry. Services include evaluation of management teams and business plans, identification of strengths and weaknesses of the other company, and analyses of the company's financial models, systems, products and operational and business processes. Post-investment support is also provided to help customers in the optimization of their investment.
COMPETITION

The market for consulting services and software solutions remains intensely competitive, highly fragmented and rapidly changing. We face competition from major business and strategy consulting firms, large systems integrators and major global outsourcing firms as a result of the outsourcing of business support systems and operating support systems by communications companies, offshore development firms from the Asian markets, equipment and software firms that have added service offerings, boutique consulting firms and customers' internal resources. We believe that there has been a significant increase in recent years in demand for firms that can bundle business process outsourcing, or BPO, with systems and technical integration. Many of our competitors are large organizations that provide a broad range of services to companies in many industries, including the communications industry. In addition, we compete with boutique firms that maintain specialized skills and/or geographical advantages. Many information technology consulting firms also maintain significant practice groups devoted to the communications industry. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than us.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include: the ability to provide payback on our services to clients through proven business cases; the ability to provide innovative solutions; the ability to provide deep and proven expertise and talent; the ability to provide capability and expertise in delivering complex projects through teams located globally; availability of resources; price of solutions; industry knowledge; understanding of user experience; and sophisticated project and program management capability.

We believe our primary competitive advantage stems from our exclusive focus on the communications, digital media and technology industries. As industry specialists, we believe that the complementary experience and expertise of our professionals represents a competitive advantage. Furthermore, we believe that our specialization equips us with a competitive differentiator in our ability to develop and deliver solutions that enhance our clients’ revenues and asset utilization leading to greater return on investment. Our biggest challenge is normally the customer's internal resources and budget constraints. As a result, the most significant competitive advantage becomes long-term relationships with key client executives that have developed over time from consistency in responsiveness to their needs, quality and reliability of consultants and deliverables, and an appropriate price/value formula.

7

We have experienced reduced demand in certain offerings and a market trend of increased price competition, resulting primarily from market evolution and large firms with offshore capabilities and the financial resources to aggressively price engagements in which they have a particular interest in obtaining and the ability to provide technical support and outsourcing. These developments have required us to focus on decreasing our overall cost structure to align with lower revenue levels and direct our resources toward our top revenue generating clients in which we are deeply imbedded.

EMPLOYEES

Our ability to recruit and retain experienced, highly qualified and highly motivated personnel has contributed greatly to our performance and will be critical in the future. We offer a flexible recruiting model that enhances our ability to attract consultants and to effectively manage utilization. Our consultants may work as full-time or part-time employees. We also have relationships with many independent contracting firms to assist in delivery of consulting solutions. Our current base of independent firms has specialized expertise in discrete areas of communications, and we typically deploy these firms only when their unique expertise/offering is required.

During fiscal year 2016, we utilized approximately 529 consultants, representing a combination of employee client service personnel and independent contracting firms. Of these, 325 were employee consultants and approximately 204 were working on engagements for us primarily through independent subcontracting firms. In addition to the consultants, we have an administrative staff of approximately 33 employees in the accounting and finance, marketing, recruiting, information technology, human resources, legal and administrative areas. As of December 31, 2016, we had 298 total employees, of which 262 were full-time.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

We identify our segments based on the way management organizes the business to assess performance and make operating decisions regarding the allocation of resources. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280 "Segment Reporting," we have concluded that we have three reportable segments: the North America segment, the EMEA segment and the Strategic Alliances segment. The North America and EMEA segments are both single reportable, operating segments that encompass the Company’s operational, technology and software consulting services inside of North America and outside of North America, respectively. Both reportable segments offer management consulting, custom developed software, and technical services. The Strategic Alliances reportable segment is a single, reportable segment that includes the Company’s world-wide commercial activities undertaken with third-party service or solutions providers.

For a discussion of operating results by segment, please see Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, and Note 7, Business Segments, Major Customers and Significant Group Concentrations of Credit Risk, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 “Consolidated Financial Statements” of this report.

MAJOR CUSTOMERS

Since our inception, we have provided services to over a thousand domestic and international customers, primarily communication service providers and large technology and applications firms serving the communications industry and financial firms that invest in this sector. In more recent years, we have added to our base of customers with cable, media and entertainment clients looking to leverage communications infrastructure to deliver offerings to the market. We depend on a small number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenues. For fiscal year 2016, three customers accounted for 22%, 17% and 12%, respectively, of our revenues. No other single customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues. Also during fiscal year 2016, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 77% of total revenues. We generally provide discounted pricing for large projects on fixed commitments with long-term customers. Our clients' needs for services vary substantially from period to period and therefore they typically engage services on a project basis.

We continue to concentrate on large wireline, wireless, and cable MSOs headquartered principally in North America, the United Kingdom and Western Europe, as well as media and entertainment clients. We seek to offer broad and diversified services to these customers. We anticipate that operating results will continue to depend on the volume of services provided to a relatively small number of customers.

FOREIGN MARKETS

A substantial portion of our business is conducted in foreign markets and a substantial portion of our revenues and costs are derived from our international business. Our international revenues in the 2016 fiscal year represented 59.1% of our total revenues, up from 55.9% of our total revenues in the 2015 fiscal year. For information on results of operations and assets by geographic location, please see Note 7, Business Segments, Major Customers and Significant Group Concentrations of Credit Risk, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 “Consolidated Financial Statements” of this report. Our international operations expose us to a number of business and economic risks, including unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates or fluctuations; our ability to protect our intellectual property; the impact of foreign laws, regulations and trade customs; U.S. and foreign taxation issues; potential limits on our ability to repatriate foreign profits; and general political and economic trends, including political and economic conditions in foreign markets and the potential impact of terrorist attacks or international hostilities. If we are unable to achieve anticipated levels of revenues from or efficiently manage our international operations, our overall revenues and profitability may decline.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES

Our research and development costs for internally-developed software products that are used by our associates in delivering services to our clients totaled $0.9 million and $1.4 million in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. During fiscal years 2016 and 2015, $0.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of these costs were expensed as incurred. During fiscal years 2016 and 2015, $0.4 million and $0.6 million of internal use software development costs were capitalized, respectively.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Our success is dependent, in part, upon proprietary processes and methodologies. We rely upon a combination of copyright, trade secret, and trademark law to protect our intellectual property. Additionally, employees and consultants sign non-disclosure agreements to assist us in protecting our intellectual property. We utilize the tradenames "Cartesian" and “Farncombe” in our business. Solely for convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to in this Form 10-K may appear without the ® or tm symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights, or the rights of the applicable licensor to these trademarks and trade names.
SEASONALITY

In the past, we have experienced seasonal fluctuations in revenues in the fourth quarter due primarily to the fewer number of business days because of the holiday periods occurring in that quarter. We continue to experience fluctuations in revenue in the fourth quarter and with global expansion, may experience fluctuations in summer months and other holiday periods.
