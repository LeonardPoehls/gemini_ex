ITEM 1-RISK FACTORS
 
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this item.
 
Cumulative voting is not available to stockholders.
 
Cumulative voting in the election of directors is expressly denied in our Articles of Incorporation. Accordingly, the holder or holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock may elect all of our Directors. Management's large percentage ownership of the outstanding common stock helps enable them to maintain their positions as such and thus control of our business and affairs. 
 
The trading price of the common stock entails additional regulatory requirements, which may negatively affect such trading price. 
 
The trading price of our common stock is below $5.00 per share. As a result of this price level, trading in our common stock is subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Exchange Act. These rules require additional disclosure by broker‑dealers in connection with any trades generally involving any non‑NASDAQ equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Such rules require the delivery, before any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith, and impose various sales practice requirements on broker‑dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions). For these types of transactions, the broker‑dealer must determine the suitability of the penny stock for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction before sale. The additional burdens imposed upon broker‑dealers by such requirements may discourage broker‑dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock. As a consequence, the market liquidity of our common stock could be severely affected or limited by these regulatory requirements.

The Company will incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, imposed various new requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. The Company’s management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these new compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase the Company’s legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations are expected to make it more difficult and more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and the Company may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage.
 
In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that the Company maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, the Company must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Compliance with Section 404 will require that the Company incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. The Company currently does not have an internal audit group, and will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Moreover, if the Company is unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if the independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of the stock could decline, and the Company could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.
 
Management controls a significant percentage of our current outstanding common stock and their interests may conflict with those of our shareholders. 
 
As of June 30, 2018, the directors and executive officers and their respective affiliates collectively and beneficially owned approximately 13.24% of the outstanding common stock, including all warrants exercisable within 60 days. This concentration of voting control gives the Directors and executive officers and their respective affiliates substantial influence over any matters which require a shareholder vote, including, without limitation, the election of directors, even if their interests may conflict with those of other shareholders. It could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control. This could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock or prevent the shareholders from realizing a premium over the then prevailing market prices for their shares of common stock.
 
The Company is dependent on key personnel. 
 
We depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel, including R. Pierce Onthank, our President and Chief Executive Officer. The future loss of Mr. Onthank could adversely affect the implementation of the Company’s business plan. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any officer or director.
 
The Company’s revenues from production are derived from a single well.
 
The revenues previously accrued to us from the Yasin Block were derived from a single well, the Haseeb No. 1. Formation water intrusion at the well caused production of hydrocarbons to temporarily cease. Hycarbex management has completed repairs to the well and has successfully revived the productivity of the well but future reliance upon a single well which may encounter natural or mechanical decline or cessation of production creates a risk that the Company will not be able to meet all of its financial obligations. 
 
The retention of ownership and the entitlement and ability to develop the Yasin and other Pakistan-based concessions will depend upon Hycarbex’s ability to meet the seismic, drilling and financial obligations imposed by the Government of Pakistan. 
 
The Yasin exploration license and the exploration licenses for each other Pakistan-based concession operated by Hycarbex are subject to performance requirements imposed by the Government of Pakistan, including seismic, drilling and financial guarantees. The Company’s lack of available financial resources to timely meet one or more of the requirements could result in a governmental forfeiture of a particular exploration license or a portion of the acreage covered by the exploration license. In addition, the Company’s ongoing appraisement and investigation of the existing and potential third party liabilities associated with each concession could result in the discovery of liabilities which further hinder the ability to meet these governmental requirements.

The further development of the Yasin Block and development of the other Pakistan-based concessions will depend upon Hycarbex’s ability to secure a strategic development partner or its ability to sell selected assets. 
 
The proceeds of stock sales and loans utilized to date to fund the administrative costs of the Company, including legal fees, are not sufficient to meet the anticipated costs of operating or developing the Pakistan-based assets owned by Hycarbex. The anticipated capital costs for operating or developing the Pakistan-based concessions can only be met by securing a strategic development partner and/or the sale of selected Hycarbex assets. 
 
The favorable policies toward foreign investment in Pakistan oil and gas exploration could change.
 
Future governmental enactments or changes to existing policies could impact our ownership or asset value. The working interests held by our Hycarbex subsidiary and other interests which we will seek to acquire in other concession opportunities could be adversely affected by future regulatory and/or policy changes. Since the value of these interests is derived from the actual net proceeds of production, changes to the duration of the exploration license, applicable taxes or tariffs, or commodity purchase prices could significantly affect our interests in the region.
 
We may experience potential fluctuations in results of operations.
 
Our future revenues may be affected by a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control, including (a) the success of project results; (b) swings in availability of services needed to implement projects and the pricing of such services; (c) a volatile oil and gas pricing market which may make certain projects that we undertake uneconomic; (d) the ability to develop infrastructure to accommodate growth; (e) the ability to attract new independent producers with prospects in a timely and effective manner; and (f) the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to establishing our business operations and infrastructure. As a result of our limited operating history and the emerging nature of our business plan, it is difficult to forecast revenues or earnings accurately, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. 
 
The issuance of additional authorized shares of our common and preferred stock or the exercise of stock options and warrants may dilute our investors and adversely affect the market for our common stock.
 
We are authorized to issue 80,000,000 shares of our common stock. The 71,904,290 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding does not include shares reserved in anticipation of the exercise of options or warrants. As of June 30, 2018, we had outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and we have reserved shares of our common stock for issuance in connection with the potential exercise thereof. To the extent such options or warrants are exercised, the holders of our common stock will experience further dilution. In addition, in the event that any future financing should be in the form of, be convertible into or exchangeable for, equity securities, and upon the exercise of options and warrants, investors may experience additional dilution.
 
Possible or actual sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders could have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market prices prevailing from time to time. Nevertheless, the possibility that substantial amounts of common stock may be sold in the public market would likely have a material adverse effect on prevailing market prices for the common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities.
 
The exercise of the outstanding convertible securities will reduce the percentage of common stock held by our stockholders. Further, the terms on which we could obtain additional capital during the life of the convertible securities may be adversely affected, and it should be expected that the holders of the convertible securities would exercise them at a time when we would be able to obtain equity capital on terms more favorable than those provided for by such convertible securities. As a result, any issuance of additional shares of common stock may cause our current stockholders to suffer significant dilution which may adversely affect the market. 
 
In addition to our shares of common stock which may be issued without stockholder approval, we have 20,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock, the terms of which may be fixed by our Board of Directors. We presently have no issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock and while we have no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock, our Board of Directors has the authority, without stockholder approval, to create and issue one or more series of such preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend and other rights of holders of such preferred stock. The issuance of any of such series of preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the holders of common stock.

The Company and the operators of projects in which it participates depend on industry vendors and may not be able to obtain adequate services.
 
Our third party oil and gas operators are largely dependent on industry vendors for our success. These contracted services include, but are not limited to, accounting, drilling, completion, workovers and reentries, geological evaluations, engineering, leasehold acquisition (landmen), operations, legal, investor relations/public relations, and prospect generation. We could be harmed if the operators of our projects fail to attract quality industry vendors to participate in the drilling of prospects or if industry vendors do not perform satisfactorily. We have little control over factors that influence the performance of such vendors. 
 
The Company relies on third parties for production services and processing facilities.
 
The marketability of our production depends upon the proximity of our projects’ reserves to, and the capacity of, facilities and third party services, including oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines, trucking or terminal facilities, and processing facilities. The unavailability or lack of capacity of such services and facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. A shut-in or delay or discontinuance could materially adversely affect our financial condition. 
 
The Company’s Directors and Officers have limited liability and have rights to indemnification.
 
Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide, as permitted by governing Nevada law, that our directors and officers shall not be personally liable to the Company or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, with certain exceptions. The Articles further provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers against expenses and liabilities they incur to defend, settle, or satisfy any civil litigation or criminal action brought against them on account of their being or having been its directors or officers unless, in such action, they are adjudged to have acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct.
 
The inclusion of these provisions in the Articles may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited us and our stockholders. 
 
The Articles provide for the indemnification of our officers and directors, and the advancement to them of expenses in connection with any proceedings and claims. The Articles include related provisions meant to facilitate the indemnitee's receipt of such benefits. These provisions cover, among other things: (i) specification of the method of determining entitlement to indemnification and the selection of independent counsel that will in some cases make such determination, (ii) specification of certain time periods by which certain payments or determinations must be made and actions must be taken, and (iii) the establishment of certain presumptions in favor of an indemnitee. 
 
General Risks of the Oil and Gas Business
 
Investment in the oil and gas business is risky.
 
Oil and gas exploration and development is an inherently speculative activity. There is no certain method to determine whether or not a given prospect will produce oil or gas or yield oil or gas in sufficient quantities and quality to result in commercial production. There is always the risk that development of a prospect may result in dry holes or in the discovery of oil or gas that is not commercially feasible to produce. There is no guarantee that a producing asset will continue to produce. Because of the high degree of risk involved, there can be no assurance that the Company will recover any portion of its investment or that its investment in oil and gas exploration activities will be profitable.

The oil and gas business is subject to drilling and operational hazards.
 
The oil and gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including:
 


· | blowouts, cratering and explosions; 
--+----------------------------------------------------
· | mechanical and equipment problems; 
· | uncontrolled flows of oil and gas or well fluids; 
· | fires; 
· | marine hazards with respect to offshore operations;
· | formations with abnormal pressures; 
· | pollution and other environmental risks; and 
· | natural disasters. 

 
Any of these events could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses. Locating pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase these risks. In accordance with customary industry practice, our operators will maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and the results of operations.
 
The Company will face fierce competition from other companies in the acquisition of development opportunities.

A large number of companies and individuals engage in drilling for gas and oil, and there is competition for the most desirable prospects. This is likewise the case in Pakistan where foreign investment is accelerating at a tremendous pace. We will encounter intense competition from other companies and other entities in the pursuit of quality prospects for investment. We may be competing with numerous gas and oil companies which may have financial resources significantly greater than ours. 
 
Oil and gas properties are subject to unanticipated depletion. 
 
The acquisition of oil and gas prospects is almost always based on available geologic and engineering data, the extent and quality of which vary in each case. Successful wells may deplete more rapidly than the available geological and engineering data originally indicated. Unanticipated depletion, if it occurs, would result in a lower return for the Company or a loss to the shareholders.
 
Oil and gas prices are volatile.
 
Our revenues, cash flow, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on the prices that we receive for oil and gas production. Declines in oil and gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. High oil and gas prices could preclude acceptance of our business model. Depressed prices in the future would have a negative effect on our future financial results.
 
Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Prices for oil and gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply of and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:
 


· | the threat of global terrorism; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | regional political instability in areas where the exploratory wells are drilled; 
· | the available supply of oil; 
· | the level of consumer product demand; 
· | weather conditions; 
· | political conditions and policies in the greater oil producing regions, including the Middle East; 
· | the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;
· | the price of foreign imports; 
· | actions of governmental authorities; 
· | domestic and foreign governmental regulations; 
· | the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels; and 
· | overall economic conditions. 

 
These factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty future oil and gas prices. Our inability to respond appropriately to changes in these factors could negatively affect our profitability.

Terrorist attacks and continued hostilities in the Middle East or other sustained military campaigns may adversely impact the industry and us. 
 
The terrorist attacks that took place in the United States on September 11, 2001, were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties, some of which may materially adversely impact us. The long-term impact that terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks may have on the oil and gas business is not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding continued hostilities in the Middle East or other sustained military campaigns may adversely impact us in unpredictable ways. 
 
Political instability both internal and external to Pakistan could adversely affect drilling operations and gas marketing.
 
Pakistan is geographically positioned in a region which has experienced a great deal of political instability and violence. The current regime is viewed as pro-western, but a change in government in Pakistan, such as an Islamic fundamentalist government, could have many wide-ranging adverse effects upon the validity of existing exploration licenses and concession agreements and upon our ability to enforce our contractual agreements. Additionally, with or without such governmental changes, recurring incidents of violence could adversely affect oil and gas exploration and marketing operations which would, in turn, adversely affect our ability to receive royalty payments derived from those operations. Examples of regional conflicts, incidents and political unrest inside Pakistan’s borders include the following:
 


· | the Kashmir region bordering India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and China, has been a continuing source of tension and armed conflict between India and Pakistan since 1947; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Baluchistan Province tribesmen have previously attacked the Sui gas fields in Balochistan in Southwest Pakistan generally as a protest for more jobs and higher royalty payments; and 
· | Pakistan has experienced violence along its Afghanistan border as well as incidents of internal urban violence from fundamentalist militant Islamic groups who oppose governmental ties with the United States.

 
Continued incidents of political unrest and violence in the future could interrupt drilling operations and gas marketing of our projects.
 
The Company’s domestic assets are subject to domestic governmental regulations and hazards related to environmental issues.
 
Gas and oil operations in the United States are subject to extensive government regulation and to interruption or termination by governmental authorities on account of ecological and other considerations. The Environmental Protection Agency of the United States and the various state departments of environmental affairs closely regulate gas and oil production effects on air, water and surface resources. Furthermore, proposals concerning regulation and taxation of the gas and oil industry are constantly before Congress. It is impossible to predict future proposals that might be enacted into law and the effect they might have on the Company. Thus, restrictions on gas and oil activities, such as production restrictions, price controls, tax increases and pollution and environmental controls may have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
Hazards in the drilling and/or the operation of gas and oil properties, such as accidental leakage or spillage, are sometimes encountered. Such hazards may cause substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities, the payment of which could reduce distributions or result in the loss of Company leases. Although it is anticipated that insurance will be obtained by third-party operators for the benefit of the Company, we may be subject to liability for pollution and other damages due to environmental events which cannot be insured against due to prohibitive premium costs, or for other reasons. Environmental regulatory matters also could increase substantially the cost of doing business, may cause delays in producing oil and gas or require the modification of operations in certain areas. Operations are subject to numerous stringent and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, and the imposition of injunctions to force future compliance.

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) and its implementing regulations impose a variety of requirements related to the prevention of oil spills, and liability for damages resulting from such spills in United States waters. OPA 90 imposes strict joint and several liability on responsible parties for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages, including natural resource damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operation regulation. If a party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply. Even if applicable, the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs, plus up to $75 million in other damages. For onshore facilities, the total liability limit is $350 million. OPA 90 also requires a responsible party at an offshore facility to submit proof of its financial ability to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill. 
 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws impose strict, joint and several liability on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These parties include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and those that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site. Responsible parties under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for remediation costs at the site, and may also be liable for natural resource damages. Additionally, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file tort claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. 
 
State statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. In addition, there are state statutes, rules and regulations governing conservation matters, including the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. Such statutes and regulations may limit the rate at which oil and gas could otherwise be produced from the Company’s properties and may restrict the number of wells that may be drilled on a particular lease or in a particular field.
