Item 1. Business
The terms “Company,” “we,” “our”, or “us” refer to Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust, Ramco-Gershenson Properties, L.P., and/or its subsidiaries, as the context may require.
General
Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust is a fully integrated, self-administered, publicly-traded equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”) organized in Maryland.  Our primary business is the ownership and management of large multi-anchored shopping centers primarily in twelve of the largest metropolitan markets in the United States. We aim to own multiple properties in each of these metropolitan areas to leverage our management platform and to operate our centers efficiently in these markets. Our target submarkets are affluent communities where our centers can offer value, convenience and a sense of place to the residents of the trade area. 
As of December 31, 2016, our property portfolio consisted of 65 wholly-owned shopping centers comprising approximately 14.5 million square feet.  We also have ownership interests of 7%, 20% and 30%, in three joint ventures. Our joint ventures are reported using the equity method of accounting.  We earn fees from these joint ventures for managing, leasing and redeveloping the shopping centers they own.  In addition, we own various parcels of land available for development or for sale, the majority of which are adjacent to certain of our existing developed properties.
We conduct substantially all of our business through our operating partnership, Ramco-Gershenson Properties, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership” or “OP”), a Delaware limited partnership.  The Operating Partnership, either directly or indirectly through partnerships or limited liability companies, holds fee title to all owned properties.  As general partner of the Operating Partnership, we have the exclusive power to manage and conduct the business of the Operating Partnership.  As of December 31, 2016, we owned approximately 97.6% of the interests in the Operating Partnership.  The limited partners are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements and are generally individuals or entities that contributed interests in certain assets or entities to the Operating Partnership in exchange for units of limited partnership interest (“OP Units”).  The holders of OP units are entitled to exchange them for our common shares on a 1:1 basis or for cash.  The form of payment is at our election.
We operate in a manner intended to qualify as a REIT pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).  Certain of our operations, including property and asset management, as well as ownership of certain land parcels, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), which are subject to federal and state income taxes.

Business Objectives, Strategies and Significant Transactions
Our business objective is to own and manage high quality shopping centers that generate cash flow for distribution to our shareholders and that have the potential for capital appreciation.  To achieve this objective, we seek to acquire, develop or redevelop shopping centers that meet our investment criteria.  We also seek to recycle capital through the sale of land or shopping centers that we deem to be fully valued or that no longer meet our investment criteria.  We use debt to finance our activities and focus on managing the amount, structure and terms of our debt to limit the risks inherent in debt financing.  From time to time, we enter into joint venture arrangements where we believe we can benefit by owning a partial interest in shopping centers and by earning fees for managing the centers for our partners.
We invest primarily in large, multi-anchored shopping centers that include national chain store tenants and market dominant supermarket tenants.  National chain anchor tenants in our centers include, among others, TJ Maxx/Marshalls, Bed Bath and Beyond, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Home Depot.  Supermarket anchor tenants in our centers include, among others, Publix Super Market, Whole Foods, Kroger and Sprouts.  Our shopping centers are primarily located in metropolitan markets such as Metro Detroit, Southeast Florida, Greater Denver, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Jacksonville, Tampa/Lakeland, Milwaukee, Chicago and Atlanta.
We also own land which is available for development or sale.  At December 31, 2016, the three largest development sites, Hartland Towne Square, Lakeland Park Center and Parkway Shops, had phase one completed. We closed on the sale of 3.18 acres at Lakeland Park Center in the fourth quarter of 2016 for the development of a health club. At Hartland Towne Square, we are under contract to sell 7.5 acres for the development of a theater with certain due diligence contingencies unresolved at year-end. The remaining future phases at these projects are in pre-development. We estimate that if we proceed with the development of the projects, up to approximately 510,000 square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA") could be developed, excluding various out parcels of land. It is our policy to start vertical construction on new development projects only after the project has received entitlements, significant anchor commitments and construction financing, if appropriate.
Our development and construction activities are subject to risks and uncertainties such as our inability to obtain the necessary governmental approvals for a project, our determination that the expected return on a project is not sufficient to warrant continuation of the planned development or our change in plan or scope for the development.  If any of these events occur, we may record an impairment provision.
Operating Strategies and Significant Transactions
Our operating objective is to maximize the risk-adjusted return on invested capital at our shopping centers.  We seek to do so by increasing the property operating income of our centers, controlling our capital expenditures, monitoring our tenants’ credit risk and taking actions to mitigate our exposure to that tenant credit risk.
During 2016, our consolidated properties reported the following leasing activity:

 | Leasing Transactions | Square Footage | Base Rent/SF (1) | | Prior Rent/SF | | Tenant Improvements/SF | | Leasing Commissions/SF | 
Renewals | 224 | 1,506,439 | $ | 15.15 | | $ | 14.26 | | $ | 0.16 | | $ | 0.02
New Leases - Comparable | 28 | 145,571 | 17.65 | | 12.47 | | 49.05 | | 4.06 | 
New Leases - Non-Comparable (2) | 74 | 372,516 | 17.07 | | N/A | | 48.92 | | 3.98 | 
Total | 326 | 2,024,526 | $ | 15.67 | | N/A | | $ | 12.65 | | $ | 1.04 | 

(1) Base rent/sf (square foot) represents contractual minimum rent under the new lease for the first 12 months of the term.
(2) Non-comparable lease transactions include leases for space vacant for greater than 12 months, leases for space which has been combined from smaller spaces or demised from larger spaces and leases structured differently from the prior lease. As a result, there is no comparable prior rent per square foot to compare to the base rent per square foot of the new lease.

Investing Strategies and Significant Transactions
Our investing objective is to generate an attractive risk-adjusted return on capital invested in acquisitions and developments.  In addition, we seek to sell land or shopping centers that we deem to be fully valued or that no longer meet our investment criteria.  We underwrite acquisitions based upon current cash flow, projections of future cash flow and scenario analyses that take into account the risks and opportunities of ownership.  We underwrite development of new shopping centers on the same basis, but also take into account the unique risks of entitling land, constructing buildings and leasing newly built space.  
In October 2016, we acquired Centennial Shops, a high-quality, multi-anchor 85,000 square foot upscale shopping center in the affluent Minneapolis suburb of Edina, Minnesota, for $32.0 million. In addition, we sold six shopping centers and several land outparcels for gross proceeds of $113.7 million. Refer to Note 4 for additional information related to acquisitions and dispositions.
At December 31, 2016, we had ten redevelopment, expansion or re-anchoring projects in process with an anticipated cost of $69.6 million, of which $40.8 million remained to be invested. Completion dates are anticipated during 2017 and early 2018.
Financing Strategies and Significant Transactions
Our financing objective is to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet in order to ensure access to capital at a competitive cost.  In general, we seek to increase our financial flexibility by increasing our pool of unencumbered properties and borrowing on an unsecured basis.  In keeping with our objective, we routinely benchmark our balance sheet on a variety of measures to our peers in the shopping center sector and to REITs in general.  
Specifically, we completed the following financing transactions:
Debt
During 2016, we issued $75.0 million in senior unsecured notes and repaid $146.5 million in mortgage notes. Refer to Note 8 for additional information related to our debt.
Equity
In June 2016, we terminated our previous controlled equity offering arrangement and commenced a new distribution agreement that registered up to 8.0 million common shares for issuance from time to time, in our sole discretion. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not issue any common shares through either arrangement. The shares issuable in the new distribution agreement are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on our registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-211925).
As of December 31, 2016 we had net debt to total market capitalization of 41.0% as compared to 42.3%, at December 31, 2015.  At December 31, 2016 and 2015 we had $263.5 million and $286.5 million, respectively, available to draw under our unsecured revolving line of credit.
Competition
See page 6 of Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a description of competitive conditions in our business.
Environmental Matters
See page 12 of Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for a description of environmental risks for our business.
Employment
As of December 31, 2016, we had 117 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
