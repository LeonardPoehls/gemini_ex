Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”), effective March 2000, securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and future action stemming from the Act, is expected to continue to significantly change the competitive environment in which the Company and the Bank conduct business. The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties. 
Employees 
At December 31, 2016, the Company and the Bank had a total of 214 full-time employees and 47 part time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management believes that we have good working relationships with our employees.
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
General
Financial institutions and their holding companies are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, the growth and earnings performance of the Company can be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of applicable state and federal statutes and regulations and the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities, including the IDFPR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), the Internal Revenue Service, state taxing authorities, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The effect of applicable statutes, regulations and regulatory policies can be significant, and cannot be predicted with a high degree of certainty.
Federal and state laws and regulations generally applicable to financial institutions, such as the Company and the Bank, regulate, among other things, the scope of business, investments, reserves against deposits, capital levels relative to operations, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, mergers, consolidations and dividends. The system of supervision and regulation applicable to the Company and the Bank establishes a comprehensive framework for their respective operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance funds and the depositors, rather than the shareholders, of financial institutions.
The following is a summary of the material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to the Company and the Bank. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply to the Company and the Bank, nor does it restate all of the requirements of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that are described. As such, the following is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable statutes, regulations and regulatory policies. Any change in applicable law, regulations or regulatory policies may have a material effect on the business of the Company and the Bank.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) became law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act constitutes one of the most significant efforts in recent history to comprehensively overhaul the financial services industry and has affected large and small financial institutions alike. While some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act took effect immediately, many of the provisions have delayed effective dates and their implementation has required the issuance of numerous new regulations.
The Dodd-Frank Act deals with a wide range of regulatory issues including, but not limited to: mandating new regulatory capital requirements that would require certain bank holding companies to be subject to the same regulatory capital requirements as their depository institutions; eliminating (with certain exceptions) trust preferred securities; codifying the Federal Reserve’s Source of Strength doctrine; creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) which has the power to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority concerning both existing and new consumer financial protection laws; permanently increasing federal deposit insurance protection to $250,000 per depositor; increasing the ratio of reserves to deposits minimum to 1.35%; assessing premiums for deposit insurance coverage on average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity, rather than on a deposit base; authorizing the assessment of examination fees; establishing new standards and restrictions on the origination of mortgages; permitting financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts; limiting interchange fees payable on debit card transactions; and implementing requirements on boards, corporate governance and executive compensation for public companies.
In July 2011, the CFPB took over many of the consumer financial functions that had been assigned to the federal banking agencies and other designated agencies. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority and there has been considerable uncertainty as to how the CFPB will continue to exercise its regulatory, supervisory, examination and enforcement authority.

The Dodd-Frank Act has had and will have significant and immediate effects on banks and bank holding companies in many areas. It is expected that the continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act will increase the cost of doing business in the banking industry.
The Company
General. The Company, as the sole stockholder of the Bank, is a bank holding company. As a bank holding company, the Company is registered with, and is subject to regulation by, the Federal Reserve Board under the Act. In accordance with Federal Reserve Board policy, the Company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances where the Company might not do so absent such policy. Under the Act, the Company is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board and is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board periodic reports of operations and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require. The Company is also subject to regulation by the IDFPR under the Illinois Bank Holding Company Act, as amended.
Investments and Activities. Under the Act, a bank holding company must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before: (i) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after the acquisition, it would own or control more than 5% of the shares of the other bank or bank holding company (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares); (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank; or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. Subject to certain conditions (including certain deposit concentration limits established by the Act), the Federal Reserve Board may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States without regard to whether the acquisition is prohibited by the law of the state in which the target bank is located. In approving interstate acquisitions, however, the Federal Reserve Board is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its insured depository institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state depository institutions or their holding companies) and state laws which require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company.
The Act also generally prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries. This general prohibition is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve Board to be “so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.” Under current regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, the Company is permitted to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the operation of a thrift, consumer finance or equipment leasing business, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software development), and the operation of mortgage banking and brokerage businesses. The Act generally does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of non-bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies.
In November 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act “GLB Act” was signed into law. Under the GLB Act, bank holding companies that meet certain standards and elect to become “financial holding companies” are permitted to engage in a wider range of activities than those permitted for bank holding companies, including securities and insurance activities. Specifically, a bank holding company that elects to become a financial holding company may engage in any activity that the Federal Reserve Board, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines is (i) financial in nature or incidental thereto, or (ii) complementary to any such financial-in-nature activity, provided that such complementary activity does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. A bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company only if each of its depository institution subsidiaries is well-capitalized, well-managed, and has a Community Reinvestment Act rating of “satisfactory” or better at their most recent examination.
The GLB Act specifies many activities that are financial in nature, including lending, exchanging, transferring, investing for others, or safeguarding money or securities; underwriting and selling insurance; providing financial, investment or economic advisory services; underwriting, dealing in, or making a market in securities; and those activities currently permitted for bank holding companies that are so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks, as to be a proper incident thereto.
The GLB Act changed federal laws to facilitate affiliation between banks and entities engaged in securities and insurance activities. The law also established a system of functional regulation under which banking activities, securities activities, and insurance activities conducted by financial holding companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates will be separately regulated by banking, securities, and insurance regulators, respectively. The Company has no current plans to register as a financial holding company.
Federal law also prohibits any person or company from acquiring “control” of a bank or bank holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator. “Control” is defined in certain cases as the acquisition of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of a bank or bank holding company.

Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve Board uses regulatory capital adequacy guidelines in its examination and regulation of bank holding companies. If regulatory capital falls below minimum guideline levels, a bank holding company may, among other things, be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non bank businesses.
The following minimum regulatory capital requirements for bank holding companies were in effect as of December 31, 2016: a risk based requirements expressed as percentages of total risk weighted assets, and a leverage requirement expressed as a percentage of total assets. The risk based requirement consists of a minimum ratio of total regulatory capital to total risk weighted assets of 8%, of which at least 6% must be Tier I capital and a new common equity Tier I capital ratio with a minimum of 4.5%.
In July 2013, the federal banking agencies approved a final rule implementing the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Rule”). As discussed in more detail below, subject to a phase-in period, beginning January 1, 2015, financial institutions transitioned to the Basel III Rule and were required to report results with the first call report of 2015. The Basel III Rule applies to all banking organizations, except for bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $1.0 billion.
The Basel III Rule also exempts bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, such as the Company, from phasing out trust preferred securities (“TruPS”) and cumulative perpetual preferred stock from Tier 1 capital. Capital instruments that were issued prior to May 19, 2010, by these institutions and that are currently in Tier 1 capital, including TruPS and cumulative perpetual preferred stock, are grandfathered in Tier 1 capital, subject to certain limits. More specifically, consistent with the current requirements, these instruments are limited to 25% of Tier 1 capital elements, excluding any non-qualifying capital instruments and after all regulatory capital deductions and adjustments have been applied to Tier 1 capital.
In addition, pursuant to its Small Bank Holding Company Policy, which was amended in 2014, the Federal Reserve Board exempts certain bank holding and savings and loan holding companies from the regulatory capital requirements discussed above. The exemption applies only to bank holding companies with less than $1 billion (formerly $500 million) in consolidated assets that: (i) are not engaged in significant nonbanking activities either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; (ii) do not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities (including securitization and asset management or administration) either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; and (iii) do not have a material amount of debt or equity securities outstanding (other than trust preferred securities) that are registered with the SEC. The Company qualifies for this exemption and, thus, is required to meet applicable regulatory capital standards on a bank-only basis. However, bank holding companies with assets of less than $1 billion are subject to various restrictions on debt including requirements that debt is retired within 25 years of being incurred, that the debt to equity ratio is .30 to 1 within 12 years of the incurrence of debt and that dividends generally cannot be paid if the debt to equity ratio exceeds 1 to 1.
Dividends. The Company is organized under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). The DGCL allows the Company to pay dividends only out of its surplus (as defined and computed in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL) or if the Company has no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.
Additionally, the Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies. The policy statement provides that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends which exceed its net income or which can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health, such as by borrowing. The Federal Reserve Board also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies.
Our ability to declare dividends and pay these dividends to our stockholders will depend on the Company’s receipt of dividends from the Bank, as we have no other source of revenue with which to pay dividends. Prior to August 13, 201, under Illinois law the Bank could only pay dividends equal to or less than its cumulative net profits then on hand, deducting from the net profits the bank’s cumulative losses and bad debts. For many banks that suffered losses as a result of the 2008 recession, including the Bank, the banks have recovered and are generating profits, but the banks may not begin paying dividends until year-to-year cumulative undivided profits exceed the earlier years’ losses. The effect of this provision in the Illinois Banking Act is that these otherwise healthy banks must wait many years before they can begin paying dividends again. Effective August 13, 2015 the Illinois Banking Act was amended to address this dividend issue by authorizing a state bank to restate its capital accounts to eliminate a deficit in its undivided profits account so long as prior to the restatement the bank receives the written approval of the Secretary of the IDFPR. The Bank may now, with the permission of the IDFPR and subject to Federal Reserve Board requirements, restate its capital accounts and begin paying dividends again so long as the Bank is profitable.

THE BANK
Centrue Bank
The Bank is an Illinois-chartered bank, the deposit accounts of which are insured by the FDIC. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Reserve System (“member bank”). As an Illinois-chartered, FDIC-insured member bank, the Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the IDFPR, as the chartering authority for Illinois banks, the Federal Reserve Board, as the primary federal regulator of member banks, and the FDIC, as administrator of deposit insurance.
Deposit Insurance. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limitations by a deposit insurance fund administered by the FDIC. As an FDIC insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the deposit insurance fund pursuant to a risk-based assessment system. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised the basic limit on deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor.
Under the FDIC’s risk based assessment regulations there are four risk categories, and each insured institution is assigned to a risk category based on capital levels and supervisory ratings. Well-capitalized institutions with CAMELS composite ratings of 1 or 2 are placed in Risk Category I while other institutions are placed in Risk Categories II, III or IV depending on their capital levels and CAMELS composite ratings. The assessment rates may be changed by the FDIC as necessary to maintain the insurance fund at the reserve ratio designated by the FDIC.
A bank’s initial assessment rate is based upon the risk category to which it is assigned. Adjustments may be made to a bank’s initial assessment rate based certain factors including levels of long-term unsecured debt, levels of secured liabilities above a threshold amount, and, for certain institutions, brokered deposit levels. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, in February 2011, the FDIC adopted a final rule that redefines its deposit insurance premium assessment base to be an insured depository institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity capital, rather than on deposits. In addition, FDIC has revised its deposit insurance rate schedules as a consequence of the changes to the assessment base. On an unadjusted basis, initial base assessment rates now range between 5 basis points in the lowest risk category and 35 basis points for banks in the highest risk category.
Due to a decrease in the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund, in October 2008, the FDIC established a restoration plan to restore the reserve ratio to at least 1.15%. However, the Dodd-Frank Act raised the minimum reserve ratio to 1.35% and removed the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires that the reserve ratio reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020. Effective January 1, 2011, the FDIC set the long term reserve ratio at 2%. The FDIC has been directed to offset the effects of increased assessments on depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets.
The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the FDIC determines, after a hearing, that the institution (i) has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, (ii) is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or (iii) has violated any applicable law, regulation, order, or any condition imposed in writing by, or written agreement with, the FDIC. The FDIC may also suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for a permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. Management of the Company is not aware of any activity or condition that could result in termination of the deposit insurance of the Bank.
FICO Assessments. FDIC insured institutions are also subject to assessments to cover interest payments due on the outstanding obligations of the Financing Corporation (“FICO”). FICO was created in 1987 to finance the recapitalization of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. These FICO assessments are in addition to amounts assessed by the FDIC for deposit insurance until the final maturity of the outstanding FICO obligations in 2019. FDIC insured institutions will share the cost of the interest on the FICO bonds on a pro rata basis. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the FICO assessment rate for DIF members ranged between approximately 0.0056% and 0.0058% of deposits. During the year ended December 31, 2016 the Bank paid FICO assessments totaling $0.05 million.
For the first quarter of 2017, the rate established by the FDIC for the FICO assessment 0.0056% of deposits.
Supervisory Assessments. All Illinois banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the IDFPR to fund the operations of the IDFPR. The amount of the assessment is calculated based on the institution’s total assets, including consolidated subsidiaries, as reported to the IDFPR. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Bank paid supervisory assessments to the IDFPR totaling $0.1 million.
Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Bank is required to comply with regulatory capital adequacy standards set by the FDIC. The FDIC may establish higher minimum requirements if, for example, a bank has previously received special attention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk. Banks with regulatory capital ratios below the required minimum are subject to certain administrative actions. More than one regulatory capital adequacy standard applies, and all applicable standards must be satisfied for an institution to be considered to be in compliance. There are four basic measures of regulatory capital adequacy: a total risk-based capital measure, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a Common equity tier 1 capital ratio; and a leverage ratio.

(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)

The risk-based framework was adopted to assist in the assessment of regulatory capital adequacy of financial institutions by, (i) making regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among organizations; (ii) introducing off-balance-sheet items into the assessment of regulatory capital adequacy; (iii) reducing the disincentive to holding liquid, low-risk assets; and (iv) achieving greater consistency in evaluation of regulatory capital adequacy of major banking organizations throughout the world. The risk-based guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning assets and off-balance sheet items to different risk categories. An institution’s risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing its qualifying regulatory capital by its risk-weighted assets.
Qualifying regulatory capital consists of two types of capital components: “core capital elements” (or Tier 1 capital) and “supplementary capital elements” (or Tier 2 capital). Tier 1 capital is generally defined as the sum of core capital elements less goodwill and other intangibles. Core capital elements consist of (i) common shareholders’ equity, (ii) noncumulative perpetual preferred stock (subject to certain limitations), and (iii) minority interests in the equity capital accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Tier 2 capital consists of (i) allowance for loan and lease losses (subject to certain limitations); (ii) perpetual preferred stock which does not qualify as Tier 1 capital (subject to certain conditions); (iii) hybrid capital instruments and mandatory convertible debt securities; (iv) term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock (subject to limitations); and (v) net unrealized holding gains on equity securities.
As described above, in July 2013 the federal banking regulators released the Basel III Rule relating to minimum regulatory capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. The Basel III Rule does not apply to bank holding companies with less than $1.0 billion in consolidated assets, such as the Company; however, many of the requirements apply to the Bank. Namely, the Basel III Rule modifies standards for the risk-weighted assets calculation, sets new minimum regulatory capital requirements and refines capital quality through various eligibility restrictions. The Basel III Rule became effective as applied to the Bank on January 1, 2015, with a phase in period of the requirements that generally extends from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019.
Under current regulatory capital adequacy standards and the Basel III Rule, the Bank must meet a minimum ratio of qualifying total regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%. Of that ratio, at least half, or 4%, was required to be in the form of Tier 1 capital. The Basel III Rule increases the required minimum Tier 1 capital ratio from 4% to 6%. The Basel III Rule also increased the minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio from 3% to 4%. The Basel III Rule also established a Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio of 4.5% and phases in a capital conservation buffer equivalent to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.
The capital conservation buffer as fully implemented will require a 2.5% buffer above these required minimum regulatory capital ratio levels. Banking organizations that fail to maintain the minimum 2.5% capital conservation buffer may face restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The Basel III rule also revises the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets for certain types of assets and exposures.
In addition, the Basel III rule provides that smaller banking organizations could make a one-time election to opt out of including most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. This opt-out excludes from regulatory capital both unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities and accumulated net gains and losses on cash-flow hedges and amounts attributable to defined benefit post-retirement plans. The Bank made this opt-out election and will exclude the change in unrealized gains and losses in these items from its regulatory capital.
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. The Federal Reserve Board is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s degree of undercapitalization. Generally, a bank is considered “well capitalized” if its risk-based capital ratio is at least 10%, its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is at least 6%, its leverage ratio is at least 5%, and the bank is not subject to any written agreement, order, or directive by the FDIC.
A bank generally is considered “adequately capitalized” if it does not meet each of the standards for well-capitalized institutions, and its risk-based capital ratio is at least 8%, its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is at least 4%, and its leverage ratio is at least 4% (or 3% if the institution receives the highest rating under the Uniform Financial Institution Rating System). A bank that has a risk-based capital ratio less than 8%, or a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio less than 4%, or a leverage ratio less than 4% (3% or less for institutions with the highest rating under the Uniform Financial Institution Rating System) is considered to be “undercapitalized.” A bank that has a risk-based capital ratio less than 6%, or a Tier 1 capital ratio less than 3%, or a leverage ratio less than 3% is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized,” and a bank is considered “critically undercapitalized” if its ratio of tangible equity to total assets is equal to or less than 2%.
The Basel III Rule revised the current prompt corrective action requirements effective January 1, 2015 by:

• | Introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being a minimum of 6.5% for well-capitalized status;


• | Increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the current 6%); and

(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)


• | Eliminating the current provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized.

The Basel III Rule did not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any prompt corrective action category.
Subject to a narrow exception, the FDIC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a bank that is “critically undercapitalized.” In addition, a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date a bank receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Compliance with the plan must be guaranteed by each company that controls a bank that submits such a plan, up to an amount equal to 5% of the bank’s assets at the time it was notified regarding its deficient capital status. In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions, and expansion. The FDIC could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.
Regulatory Agreements. On December 18, 2009, the Bank entered into a written agreement (the “Agreement”) with the Federal Reserve-Chicago and the IDFPR. The Agreement required the Bank to make certain commitments related to credit risk management practices; improving loan underwriting and loan administration; improving asset quality by enhancing the Bank’s position on problem loans through repayment, additional collateral or other means; reviewing and revising as necessary the Bank’s allowance for loan and lease losses policy; maintaining sufficient capital at the Bank, implementing an earnings plan and comprehensive budget to improve and sustain the Bank’s earnings; and improving the Bank’s liquidity position and funds management practices. The Bank complied with its obligations under the Agreement, and the Agreement was terminated on February 16, 2016.
Dividends. Under the Illinois Banking Act, Illinois-chartered banks may not pay dividends in excess of their net profits then on hand, after deducting losses and bad debts. The Federal Reserve Act also imposes limitations on the amount of dividends that may be paid by state member banks, such as the Bank. Generally, a member bank may pay dividends out of its undivided profits, in such amounts and at such times as the bank’s board of directors deems prudent. Without prior Federal Reserve Board approval, however, a state member bank may not pay dividends in any calendar year which, in the aggregate, exceed such bank’s calendar year-to-date net income plus such bank’s retained net income for the two preceding calendar years, less any required transfers to additional paid-in capital or to a fund for the retirement of preferred stock.
The payment of dividends by any financial institution or its holding company is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate regulatory capital pursuant to applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and a financial institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized. In addition, notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the payment of any dividends by the Bank if the Federal Reserve Board determines such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. 
The Illinois Banking Act was amended August 13, 2015 to address the dividend restriction by authorizing a state bank to restate its capital accounts to eliminate a deficit in its undivided profits account so long as prior to the restatement the bank receives the written approval of the IDFPR. The Bank may now, with the permission of the IDFPR and subject to Federal Reserve Board requirements, restate its capital accounts and begin paying dividends again so long as the Bank is profitable.
Insider Transactions. The Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to the Company, on investments in the stock or other securities of the Company and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the Company as collateral for loans. Certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by the Bank to its directors and officers, to directors and officers of the Company, to principal stockholders of the Company, and to “related interests” of such directors, officers and principal stockholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person becoming a director or officer of the Company or a principal stockholder of the Company may obtain credit from the banks with which the Bank maintains a correspondent relationship.
Safety and Soundness Standards. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines which establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of federally insured depository institutions. The guidelines set forth standards for internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings.
In general, the safety and soundness guidelines prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals. If an institution fails to comply with any of the standards set forth in the guidelines, the institution’s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance. If an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency cited in the regulator’s order is cured, the regulator may restrict the institution’s rate of growth, require the institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances. Noncompliance with the standards established by the

safety and soundness guidelines may also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal banking regulators, including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments.
Branching Authority. Illinois banks, such as the Bank, have the authority under Illinois law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Illinois, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. Additionally, the Bank has authority under Missouri law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Missouri, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals.
Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the “Riegle-Neal Act”), both state and national banks were allowed to establish interstate branch networks through acquisitions of other banks, subject to certain conditions, including certain limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the surviving bank and all of its insured depository institution affiliates. The establishment of new interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) was allowed by the Riegle-Neal Act only if specifically authorized by state law. However, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, interstate branching authority has been expanded. A state or national bank may open a de novo branch in another state if the law of the state where the branch is to be located would permit a state bank chartered by that state to open the branch.
State Bank Activities. Under federal law and FDIC regulations, FDIC insured state banks are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from making or retaining equity investments of a type, or in an amount, that are not permissible for a national bank. Federal law and FDIC regulations also prohibit FDIC insured state banks and their subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, from engaging as principal in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank or its subsidiary, respectively, unless the bank meets, and continues to meet, its minimum regulatory capital requirements and the FDIC determines the activity would not pose a significant risk to the deposit insurance fund of which the bank is a member.
The GLB Act also authorizes insured state banks to engage in financial activities, through subsidiaries, similar to the activities permitted for financial holding companies. If a state bank wants to establish a subsidiary engaged in financial activities, it must meet certain criteria, including that it and all of its affiliated insured depository institutions are well-capitalized and have a Community Reinvestment Act rating of at least “satisfactory” and that it is well-managed. There are capital deduction and financial statement requirements and financial and operational safeguards that apply to subsidiaries engaged in financial activities. Such a subsidiary is considered to be an affiliate of the bank and there are limitations on certain transactions between a bank and a subsidiary engaged in financial activities of the same type that apply to transactions with a bank’s holding company and its subsidiaries.
Reserve Requirement. Federal Reserve Board regulations, as presently in effect, require depository institutions including the Bank to maintain cash reserves against their net transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). Federal Reserve Banks are authorized to pay interest on such reserves.
Emerging Growth Company Status 
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), which was enacted in April 2012, has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company. The Company qualifies as and has elected to be treated as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act.
An “emerging growth company” may choose not to hold stockholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation. The Company will also not be subject to the auditor attestation requirement or additional executive compensation disclosure so long as it remains a “smaller reporting company” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally less than $75 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. The Company has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company.
A company loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates).
