Item 1. Business.
General
 
Hill International, Inc., with approximately 3,000 professionals in more than 50 offices worldwide, provides program management, project management, construction management and other consulting services primarily to the buildings, transportation, environmental, energy and industrial markets.  According to Engineering News-Record magazine, Hill was recently ranked as the eighth largest construction management firm in the United States. The terms Hill, the Company, we, us and our refer to Hill International, Inc.
 
We compete for business based on a variety of factors such as technical capability, global resources, price, reputation and past experience, including client requirements for substantial experience in similar projects.  We have developed significant long-standing relationships, which bring us repeat business and would be very difficult to replicate.  We believe we have an excellent reputation for attracting and retaining professionals.  In addition, we believe there are high barriers to entry for new competitors especially in the project management market.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our strategy emphasizes the following key elements:
 
·                  Increase Revenues from Our Existing Clients.  We have long-standing relationships with a number of public and private sector entities.  Meeting our clients diverse needs in managing construction risk and generating repeat business from our clients to expand our project base is one of our key growth strategies.  We accomplish this objective by providing a broad range of project management consulting services in a wide range of geographic areas that support our clients during every phase of a project, from concept through completion.  We believe that nurturing our existing client relationships expands our project base through repeat business.
·                  Capitalize Upon the Continued Spend in the Markets We Serve.  We believe that the demand for project management services will grow with increasing construction and infrastructure spending in the markets we serve.  We believe that our reputation and experience combined with our broad platform of service offerings will enable us to capitalize on increases in demand for our services.  In addition, we strategically open new offices to expand into new geographic areas and we aggressively hire individuals with significant contacts to accelerate growth of these new offices and to strengthen our presence in existing markets.
·                  Strengthen Professional Resources.  Our biggest asset is the people that work for Hill.  We intend to continue spending significant time recruiting and retaining the best and the brightest to improve our competitive position.  Our independent status has attracted top project management talent with varied industry experience. We believe maintaining and bolstering our team will enable us to continue to grow our business.
 
Recent events
 
·                  Control Our Costs and Expenses. The Company commenced a Profit Improvement Plan (PIP) in May 2017 following the sale of the Construction Claims Group. The Company initially identified gross, annualized pre-tax savings ranging from $27 million to $38 million. As a result of the reductions implemented to date, the partial year gross savings through December 31, 2017 is approximately $8 million, with expected annual gross savings of approximately $32 million in 2018 increasing to approximately $38 million in 2019 and beyond. The Company continues to seek additional cost savings opportunities and expects to substantially complete the PIP during the second quarter of 2018.
Reporting Segments
 
On December 20, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to sell our Construction Claims Group, which is reported herein as discontinued operations.  This transaction will permit us to strengthen our balance sheet and better

focus on our Project Management business. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the transaction.
 
Our Project Management Group provides fee-based or agency construction management services to our clients, leveraging our construction expertise to identify potential trouble, difficulties and sources of delay on a construction project before they develop into costly problems.  Our experienced professionals are capable of managing all phases of the construction process from concept through completion, including cost and budget controls, scheduling, estimating, expediting, inspection, contract administration and management of contractors, subcontractors and suppliers.
 
Our clients are typically billed a negotiated multiple of the actual direct cost of each professional assigned to a project and we are reimbursed for our out-of-pocket expenses.  We believe our fee-based consulting has significant advantages over traditional general contractors.  Specifically, because we do not assume project completion risk, our fee-based model eliminates many of the risks typically associated with providing at risk construction services.
 
Global Business
 
We operate worldwide and currently have over 50 offices in over 25 countries. The following table sets forth the amount and percentage of our revenues by geographic region for each of the past three fiscal years (dollars in thousands):

Grow Organically and Through Selective Acquisitions
 
Over the years, our business has expanded through organic growth and the acquisition of a number of project management businesses. Over the past 18 years, we have completed 14 acquisitions of project management businesses.
 
We believe that our industry includes a number of small regional companies in a highly fragmented market.  We believe that we have significant experience and expertise in identifying, negotiating, completing and integrating acquisitions and view the acquisition of these smaller competitors as a key part of our growth strategy.  Through our acquisitions, we gained entry into Spain, Mexico, Poland, Brazil and Turkey and expanded our presence in the United States. These transactions have enabled us to strengthen our geographic diversity and compete more effectively.
 
Clients
 
Our clients consist primarily of the United States and other national governments, state and local governments, and the private sector.  The following table sets forth our breakdown of revenue attributable to these categories of clients for each of the past three fiscal years (dollars in thousands):
Revenue By Client Type (As restated)
 

 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 
---------------------------------------------+---------+---------+------+-------+---------+--
U.S. federal government | $ | 12,050 | | 2.3 | % | $ | 10,737 | | 2.0 | % | $ | 12,495 | 2.6 | %
U.S. state, regional and local governments | 155,976 | | 30.2 | % | 139,086 | | 25.5 | % | 108,087 | | 22.1 | %

The following table sets forth the percentage of our revenue contributed by each of our five largest clients for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:
 

 | For the Years Ended December 31, | 
------------------------+----------------------------------+--
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 
 | (As restated) | 
Largest client | 9 | % | 8 | % | 13 | %
2nd largest client | 5 | % | 5 | % | 4 | %
3rd largest client | 5 | % | 6 | % | 3 | %
4th largest client | 4 | % | 4 | % | 3 | %
5th largest client | 4 | % | 3 | % | 3 | %
Top 5 largest clients | 27 | % | 26 | % | 26 | %

Business Development
 
The process for acquiring business from each of our categories of clients is principally the same, by participating in a competitive request-for-proposal (RFP) process, with the primary difference among clients being that the process for public sector clients is significantly more formal and complex than for private sector clients as a result of government procurement rules and regulations that govern the public-sector process.
 
Although a significant factor in our business development consists of our standing in our industry, including existing relationships and reputation based on performance on completed projects, our marketing department undertakes a variety of activities in order to expand our exposure to potential new clients.  These activities include media relations, advertising, promotions, market sector initiatives and maintaining our website and related web marketing. Media relations include placing articles that feature us and our personnel in trade publications and other media outlets.  Our promotions include arranging speaking engagements for our personnel, participation in trade shows and other promotional activities. Market sector initiatives are designed to broaden our exposure to specific sectors of the construction industry, such as, for example, participating in or organizing industry seminars.
 
Doing business with governments is complex and requires the ability to comply with intricate regulations and satisfy periodic audits.  We believe that the ability to understand these requirements and to successfully conduct business with government agencies is a barrier to entry for smaller, less experienced competitors.  Most government contracts, including those with foreign governments, are subject to termination by the government, to government audits and to continued appropriations.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, revenue from U.S. and foreign government contracts represented approximately 65.6% of our total revenue.
 
We are required from time to time to obtain various permits, licenses and approvals in order to conduct our business in many of the jurisdictions where we operate.  Our business of providing project management services is not subject to significant regulation by state, federal or foreign governments.

Contracts
 
The price provisions of our customer contracts can be grouped into three broad categories: cost-plus, time and materials, and fixed-price.  Cost-plus contracts provide for reimbursement of our costs and overhead plus a predetermined fee. Under some cost-plus contracts, our fee may be based partially on quality, schedule and other performance factors.  We also enter into contracts whereby we bill our clients monthly at hourly billing rates.  The hourly billing rates are determined by contract terms.  For governmental clients, the hourly rates are generally calculated as salary costs plus overhead costs plus a negotiated profit percentage.  For commercial clients, the hourly rate can be taken from a standard fee schedule by staff classification or it can be at a discount from this schedule.  In some cases, primarily for foreign work, a monthly rate is negotiated rather than an hourly rate.  This monthly rate is a build-up of staffing costs plus overhead and profit.  We account for these contracts on a time-and-materials method, recognizing revenue as costs are incurred.  Fixed-price contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method, wherein revenue is recognized as costs are incurred.
Backlog
 
We believe a strong indicator of our future performance is our backlog of uncompleted projects under contract or awarded.  Our backlog represents managements estimate of the amount of contracts and awards in hand that we expect to result in future revenue.  Our backlog is evaluated by management on a project-by-project basis and is reported for each period shown based upon the binding nature of the underlying contract, commitment or letter of intent, and other factors, including the economic, financial and regulatory viability of the project and the likelihood of the contract being extended, renewed or cancelled.
 
Our backlog is important to us in anticipating and planning for our operational needs.  Backlog is not a measure defined in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog.
 
At December 31, 2016, our backlog, as restated (See Note 2 item B), was $841,253,000, compared to approximately $812,598,000 at December 31, 2015. Our net bookings during December 31, 2016 of $544,667,000, which equates to a book-to-bill ratio of 105.6% compared to our goal of at least 110%. While this is short of our expectations, it is consistent with the slowdown of project activity in the Middle East due to the economic impact caused by the drop in oil prices and political upheaval and civil unrest in certain parts of the region. This will continue to be a major area of focus for 2017. We estimate that approximately $338,121,000, or 40.2% of the backlog at December 31, 2016, will be recognized during our 2017 fiscal year.
 
Although backlog reflects business that we consider to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur.  Further, substantially all of our contracts with our clients may be terminated at will, in which case the client would only be obligated to us for services provided through the termination date. Historically, the impact of terminations and modifications on our realization of revenue from our backlog has not been significant, however, in December 2016, the Company had two contracts, one in the Middle East and one in Africa, cancelled.  As a result, approximately $73,000,000 was excluded from our backlog at December 31, 2016.  Furthermore, reductions of our backlog as a result of contract terminations and modifications may be offset by additions to the backlog.
 
We adjust backlog to reflect project cancellations, deferrals and revisions in scope and cost (both upward and downward) known at the reporting date.  Future contract modifications or cancellations, however, may increase or reduce backlog and future revenue.  The following tables show our backlog by geographic region (dollars in thousands):

Competition
 
The project management industry is highly competitive. We compete for contracts, primarily on the basis of technical capability, with numerous entities, including other pure construction management companies, design or engineering firms, general contractors, management consulting firms and other entities. Compared to us, many of these competitors are larger, well-established companies that have broader geographic scope and greater financial and other resources.  During 2016, some of our largest project management competitors included: AECOM, ARCADIS N.V., Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc., WSP Parsons Brinckerhoff, Inc., Parsons Corp. and Turner Construction Co.
Insurance
 
We maintain insurance covering general and professional liability, involving bodily injury and property damage.  We have historically enjoyed a favorable loss ratio in all lines of insurance and our management considers our present limits of liability, deductibles and reserves to be adequate.  We endeavor to reduce or eliminate risk through the use of quality assurance/control, risk management, workplace safety and similar methods to eliminate or reduce the risk of losses on a project.  Although our actual rates have decreased, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increases in the dollar amount of our insurance premiums because of the increase in our revenue.
Management
 
We are led by an experienced management team with significant experience in the construction industry. Additional information about our executive officers follows.
