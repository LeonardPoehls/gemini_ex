Item 1.    BUSINESS
Our Company
We are a biotechnology company focused on developing generic versions of complex drugs, biosimilars and novel therapeutics for autoimmune disease.
Our approach to drug discovery and development is built around a complex systems analysis platform that we use to obtain a detailed understanding of complex chemical and biologic systems, design product candidates, evaluate the biological function of products and product candidates, and develop reliable and scalable manufacturing processes. The core objective of our platform is to resolve the complexity of molecular structures and related biologic systems. We first map the key measurements needed to obtain comprehensive data on a targeted molecular structure and related biology and then develop a set of analytic tools and methods, including standard, modified and proprietary analytics, to generate the data, including multiple related and complementary, or orthogonal, measures. We also utilize proprietary data analytics software. Applying our approach, we developed the first generic version of LOVENOX® (enoxaparin sodium injection), which was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in July 2010, and GLATOPA® 20 mg/mL, which was approved by the FDA in April 2015 and is, to date, the only generic version of once-daily COPAXONE® (glatiramer acetate injection) 20 mg/mL. Both products were approved without the need for clinical safety and efficacy data.
Today we are developing biosimilar and novel drug candidates using some of the structural and process insights gained from our work on complex generics. We believe our complex systems analysis platform and our biological protein engineering capabilities gives us a competitive advantage in developing biosimilars and novel therapeutics. The analytic tools and methods, models and data sets, and the knowledge and insights developed in one area further expand the platform and can direct, inform and advance efforts in other areas. For example, in our biosimilars program, the analytics aimed at fully characterizing monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins were adapted from the physicochemical analytics we developed in our complex generics programs. The biocharacterization efforts for our complex generics and biosimilar programs provide a core set of models and biologic data sets that can form the basis of inquiries in our novel therapeutic research. Our understanding of the impact of sialylation patterns on antibodies derived in our biosimilars program has informed our research on our novel autoimmune product candidates. In selecting our current development programs and in the evaluation of any potentially new programs, we look for those opportunities where we believe we can best leverage our platform to realize a competitive advantage to bring new medicines to patients and create value for our stockholders.
We have three product areas: Complex Generics, Biosimilars and Novel Therapeutics. A summary of our programs in each area is set forth below.

Complex Generics
Our Approach
We have developed generic versions of two complex drugs. Generics are therapeutic equivalents of chemically synthesized brand name drugs that were approved by the FDA under New Drug Applications, or NDAs. While most chemically synthesized brand name drugs are simple small molecules that are relatively easy to duplicate, we have focused on developing generic versions of LOVENOX and COPAXONE, which are complex molecular mixtures that are difficult to analyze and reproduce.
Our Programs
GLATOPA®20 mg/mL—Generic Once-daily COPAXONE® (glatiramer acetate injection) 20 mg/mL
GLATOPA 20 mg/mL is a generic version of once-daily COPAXONE 20 mg/mL indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, a chronic disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration. COPAXONE is available in both a once-daily 20 mg/mL formulation, which was approved by the FDA in 1996, and a three-times-weekly 40 mg/mL formulation, which was approved in January 2014. COPAXONE is marketed in the United States by Teva Neuroscience, Inc., a subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.
GLATOPA 20 mg/mL was approved by the FDA on April 16, 2015 and was launched on June 18, 2015. GLATOPA 20 mg/mL is the first "AP" rated, substitutable generic equivalent of once-daily COPAXONE. GLATOPA 20 mg/mL was developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with Sandoz AG, or Sandoz, the generic pharmaceuticals division of Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis. Under our collaboration agreement, Sandoz is responsible for commercialization of GLATOPA 20 mg/mL, and we earn 50% of contractually-defined profits on GLATOPA 20 mg/mL sales. The terms of our Sandoz collaboration for GLATOPA 20 mg/mL are further discussed below under "Collaborations, Licenses and Asset Purchases—Sandoz."
On February 17, 2017, we announced that Sandoz’ third party fill/finish manufacturing partner for GLATOPA, Pfizer Inc., received an FDA warning letter. The FDA warning letter does not restrict the production or shipment of the GLATOPA 20 mg/mL product that is currently marketed by Sandoz in the United States.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded $74.6 million in product revenues from Sandoz' profits on sales of GLATOPA 20 mg/mL.
GLATOPA 20 mg/mL was formerly referred to as "GLATOPA." GLATOPA now refers to GLATOPA 20 mg/mL and our generic product candidate for three-times-weekly COPAXONE 40 mg/mL, GLATOPA 40 mg/mL, collectively.
GLATOPA 40 mg/mL—Generic Three-times-weekly COPAXONE® (glatiramer acetate injection) 40 mg/mL
GLATOPA 40 mg/mL is our generic product candidate for three-times-weekly COPAXONE 40 mg/mL. GLATOPA 40 mg/mL is being developed in collaboration with Sandoz. Under our collaboration agreement, Sandoz is responsible for commercialization of GLATOPA 40 mg/mL, if approved, and we will earn 50% of contractually-defined profits on GLATOPA 40 mg/mL sales, if any. The terms of our Sandoz collaboration for GLATOPA 40 mg/mL are further discussed below under "Collaborations, Licenses and Asset Purchases—Sandoz."
The ANDA seeking approval of GLATOPA 40 mg/mL was filed by Sandoz in February 2014 and remains under review by the FDA. Our GLATOPA 40 mg/mL formulation contains the same active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, as GLATOPA 20 mg/mL, which we believe should help streamline the FDA review of the ANDA. To date, we are the only ANDA applicant for the three-times-weekly COPAXONE 40 mg/mL with an FDA-approved API. On February 17, 2017, we announced that Sandoz’ third party fill/finish manufacturing partner for GLATOPA, Pfizer Inc., received an FDA warning letter. The FDA may withhold approval of pending drug applications listing the facility, including the ANDA for GLATOPA 40 mg/mL, until satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations in the FDA warning letter. We therefore believe that an approval of the GLATOPA 40 mg/mL ANDA in the first quarter of 2017 is unlikely.
The ANDA approval process and related patent challenge process are described below under "Regulatory and Legal Matters—United States Government Regulation—"ANDA Approval Process for Generics" and "—Patent Challenge Process ANDAs." Legal proceedings related to GLATOPA 40 mg/mL are described below under "Item 3. Legal Proceedings -- GLATOPA 40 mg/mL-Related Proceedings." 
Teva reported $3.5 billion and $3.2 billion in U.S. sales of COPAXONE (combined 20 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL) in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
GLATOPA 40 mg/mL was formerly referred to as "M356."

Enoxaparin Sodium Injection—Generic LOVENOX®
Enoxaparin Sodium Injection is a generic version of LOVENOX indicated for the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and to support the treatment of acute coronary syndromes. LOVENOX is marketed in the United States by Sanofi. Our Enoxaparin Sodium Injection was developed and is being commercialized in the United States in collaboration with Sandoz. Under the collaboration agreement, Sandoz is responsible for commercialization of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection and we earn 50% of contractually-defined profits on Enoxaparin Sodium Injection sales. 
Due to increased generic competition and resulting decreased market pricing for generic enoxaparin sodium injection products, we do not anticipate significant Enoxaparin Sodium Injection product revenue in the near future.
Biosimilars
Our Approach
Biosimilars are biologics that are highly similar to therapeutic biologic products, referred to as reference products, approved by the FDA under Biologics License Applications, or BLAs. Biologics are produced using living cells. Biosimilars have no clinically meaningful differences from their respective reference products in terms of safety, purity and potency. Our approach to biosimilars has three parts: 

1. | Build a broad and diverse product portfolio.

We are advancing a broad portfolio of biosimilar candidates. We believe having a broad portfolio can help diversify risk, reduce reliance on single source revenue and allow us to capture the scale, technology, and regulatory synergies that are possible in biologic product development. Our portfolio consists of over half a dozen complex biosimilar candidates such as monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins at various stages of development. We select biosimilar candidates with development and litigation timelines that we believe provide us the opportunity to have the first, or among the first, biosimilars on the market for each targeted reference product.

2. | Gain competitive advantage through our scientific approach and regulatory strategies.

We believe our approach to biosimilars is capable of providing the FDA with robust and compelling analytical evidence of biosimilarity so that the FDA, under its totality-of-the-evidence approach to biosimilars, could designate our products as interchangeable and grant extrapolation across indications with reduced clinical trial requirements. We believe the realization of potentially reduced clinical and marketing costs would give our products an advantage over competing biosimilars. The biosimilar regulatory pathway is discussed in more detail below under "Regulatory and Legal Matters—United States Government Regulation—Biosimilars."

3. | Ensure product candidates are positioned to capture the global opportunity through collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies.

We are developing and commercializing M834 and five other programs in collaboration with Mylan Ireland Limited, or Mylan. Mylan provides financial resources, manufacturing expertise and extensive commercial reach to better position our product candidates for future commercial success. We are identifying and exploring possible collaboration partners for M923 who similarly possess global commercial capabilities and can help secure high quality, low cost manufacturing and distribution. 
 Biologics represent an important advance in the treatment of disease and continue to have a transformative impact on the lives of patients with difficult to treat conditions like cancer and autoimmune disease. The market for biologics is significant and growing. In 2016, the global biologics market represented approximately $225 billion in sales, with virtually the entire market comprised of brand products. In 2020, global sales of biologics are expected to be approximately $306 billion. Many currently commercially successful biologics are expected to face loss of patent exclusivity in the next five to ten years. While therapeutically beneficial, biologics can be extremely costly to patients, costing upwards of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of dollars a year. They can also be costly to governments, insurers and other payers of healthcare benefits. Biosimilars are expected to generally be more affordable than their reference products. As a result, we believe there is a significant market potential for biosimilars.
Our Programs
M923—Biosimilar HUMIRA® (adalimumab) Candidate
6


We are developing M923 as a biosimilar of HUMIRA. HUMIRA is a monoclonal antibody that can bind to a substance in the body known as tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, thereby inhibiting the known effect of TNF as a potent mediator of inflammation. HUMIRA is indicated for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and psoriasis, among other diseases. HUMIRA is the largest selling therapeutic in the world. HUMIRA is marketed globally by AbbVie.
In February 2015, a randomized, double-blind, single-dose study was commenced in healthy volunteers to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of M923 versus EU-sourced and US-sourced HUMIRA. A total of 324 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. The volunteers were randomized 1:1:1 to receive a single 40 mg injection of M923, US-sourced HUMIRA, or EU-sourced HUMIRA. The volunteers were followed for 71 days. In December 2015, we announced that M923 met its primary endpoint in the study as the data demonstrated pharmacokinetic bioequivalence to the reference products. In October 2015, a pivotal confirmatory clinical trial of M923 was initiated in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The trial is a randomized, double blind, active control, multi-center, global study in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis to compare the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of M923 with HUMIRA. In April 2016, enrollment in the pivotal clinical trial for M923 was completed, and in November 2016, following an interim analysis, we announced that M923 met its primary endpoint in the study. The proportion of subjects in the study who achieved the primary endpoint, at least 75% reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, or PASI-75, following 16 weeks of treatment, was equivalent between M923 and HUMIRA. The estimated difference in responders was well within the pre-specified confidence interval, confirming equivalence. Equivalence was also achieved for all secondary efficacy endpoints, including the achievement of PASI-50, PASI-90, proportion achieving clear or near-clear skin, and change from baseline in absolute PASI score. Adverse events were comparable in terms of type, frequency, and severity, and were consistent with the published safety data for HUMIRA. Due to unexpectedly high enrollment rates, additional patients to those included in the interim analysis were enrolled in the study. We expect to present final analysis of the full dataset for the study at a future conference or in a future publication. The first regulatory submission for marketing approval for M923 is planned for mid-2017 and, subject to marketing approval and patent considerations, we are planning for the first commercial launch to be as early as the 2020 timeframe. 
M923 was previously developed in collaboration with Baxalta. In June 2016, Baxalta became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shire plc. In September 2016, Baxalta gave us twelve months' prior written notice of the exercise of its right to terminate for its convenience our collaboration agreement. On December 31, 2016, we and Baxalta entered into an asset return and termination agreement pursuant to which the collaboration agreement was terminated effective December 31, 2016. Baxalta was relieved of its obligations to perform activities for M923 after that date, except for certain clinical and regulatory activities expected to be completed by April 2017, and in January 2017, Baxalta paid us a one-time payment of $51.2 million, representing the costs Baxalta would have incurred in performing the activities it would have performed under the collaboration agreement through the original termination effective date. The terms of the collaboration agreement and the asset return and termination agreement are described below under "Collaborations, Licenses and Asset Purchases - Baxalta." 
AbbVie reported approximately $16.1 billion in worldwide sales of HUMIRA in 2016, including approximately $10.4 billion in the United States. Total worldwide sales of HUMIRA are expected to be approximately $18.2 billion in 2020, including approximately $13.1 billion in the United States.
M834—Biosimilar ORENCIA® (abatacept) Candidate
M834 is being developed as a biosimilar of ORENCIA. ORENCIA is a complex fusion protein composed of the Fc region of the immunoglobulin IgG1 fused to the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 that inhibits an immune response by blocking certain T cell signals. ORENCIA is the only CTLA-4Ig fusion protein approved for autoimmune diseases. ORENCIA is approved for use in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis and is in development for several high unmet need indications. Analysts estimate that worldwide ORENCIA sales could increase to $2.5 billion by 2020. ORENCIA is marketed globally by Bristol-Myers Squibb and co-promoted by Ono Pharmaceutical in Japan.
M834 is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Mylan. Under our collaboration agreement, we and Mylan share equally costs and profits (losses) for M834. We and Mylan share development and manufacturing responsibilities, and Mylan will lead commercialization of M834, if approved. The terms of our Mylan collaboration are further discussed below under "Collaborations, Licenses and Asset Purchases—Mylan."
In November 2016, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, three-arm, parallel group, single-dose Phase 1 clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834 to US-sourced and EU-sourced ORENCIA. We plan to report top-line data from the trial in the second half of 2017. We believe there is currently limited biosimilar competition for M834. Subject to development, marketing approval and patent considerations, we expect to be able to launch M834 in the 2020 timeframe to be able to be among the first biosimilars of ORENCIA on the market. 
7


ORENCIA's composition of matter patents expire in the United States in 2019. In December 2016, the U.S. PTAB in an Inter Partes Review we filed upheld the validity of Bristol-Myers Squibb's formulation patent '239 on ORENCIA. We are considering our options to appeal. Information about this proceeding is further discussed below under "Item 3. Legal Proceedings -- M834-Related Proceedings." 
Bristol-Myers Squibb reported approximately $2.3 billion in worldwide sales of ORENCIA in 2016, including approximately $1.5 billion in the United States.
Other Biosimilar Programs in Collaboration with Mylan
In addition to M834, we are also developing five other biosimilar candidates from our portfolio with Mylan, including our undisclosed biosimilar candidate, M710. We and Mylan will share equally costs and profits (losses) related to these earlier stage product candidates. We and Mylan will share development and manufacturing responsibilities across product candidates, and Mylan will lead commercialization of the products, if approved. The terms of our Mylan collaboration are further discussed below under "Collaborations, Licenses and Asset Purchases—Mylan."
Total worldwide sales of the reference products that we are targeting in these biosimilar programs were approximately $17.8 billion in 2016, including approximately $11.1 billion in the United States, and are projected to be approximately $25.3 billion in 2020, including approximately $15.5 billion in the United States. Taking into account the timing of reference product loss of regulatory exclusivity and key reference product patent expirations, we plan to launch each of these products as early as the 2020-2025 timeframe to be among the first biosimilars on the market for each reference product. 
Novel Therapeutics 
Our Approach 
We seek to develop novel therapeutics and novel combinations of therapeutics that may positively modulate key disease pathways and meet significant unmet patient need. The majority of human diseases result from the interaction of a complex web of biologic systems. We believe that applying our complex systems analysis and biological protein engineering platforms may enable new insights into the complex biology underlying diseases and the optimal design of therapeutics. Currently we are applying these platforms to development of novel therapeutics for autoimmune disease.
Autoimmune Diseases
Many autoimmune diseases are characterized by the formation of autoantibodies that bind self-antigens to form immune complexes. These immune complexes can recruit and activate immune cells leading to tissue inflammation and damage, thereby presenting a common pathological mechanism across multiple autoimmune diseases. However, few therapeutic agents exist that interfere directly with these autoantibodies or immune complex-immune cell activation processes. Today, intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIg, and plasmapheresis represent the most common approaches to treat autoantibody-driven disease. IVIg is a therapeutic drug product that contains pooled, human immunoglobulin G, or IgG, antibodies purified from blood plasma. IVIg is used to treat several inflammatory diseases, including idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, or ITP, Kawasaki disease, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, or CIDP. We estimate that the global market for immunoglobulin products currently approved for use in the treatment of autoimmune disease is approximately $3.2 billion. The manufacture of IVIg, which requires large amounts of human plasma sourced from donated blood, is expensive, subject to donated blood shortages and often involves high batch-to-batch variation. 
We are developing therapeutics for patients with autoimmune diseases, and in particular, those with autoantibody-driven disease. Initially we have applied our complex systems analysis and biological protein engineering platforms in an effort to improve IVIg. We utilized our proprietary sialylation technology, a method to add sialic acid to protein, to create a high potency version of IVIg. By gaining a deeper understanding of IVIg and immune complex driven autoimmune disease, we have designed two novel recombinant therapeutic candidates to leverage what we believe are key biologies associated with autoimmune disease. The design of these candidates was based on our analysis of the complex mechanism of action of IVIg and our insights into biological protein engineering. 
We believe our novel product candidates could be capable of treating a large number of immunological disorders driven by antibodies, immune complexes, and Fc receptor biology. Such disorders include systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune neurologic diseases such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy and myasthenia gravis, autoimmune blood disorders such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura, systemic autoimmune diseases such as dermatomyositis, and antiphospholipid syndrome, antibody-mediated transplant rejection, and autoimmune blistering diseases, several of which have few treatment options.

Our Programs
M254 - hsIVIg Candidate
M254 is a hyper-sialylated version of IVIg. Using our proprietary sialylation technology, we have developed a robust, controlled sialylation process to generate tetra-Fc-sialylated immunoglobulins, or hsIVIg, with consistent enhanced anti-inflammatory activity. In nonclinical trials, hsIVIg has been shown to have up to ten times more enhanced anti-inflammatory activity than IVIg in a variety of animal models of autoimmune disease. 
Our hsIVIg product is currently in nonclinical development and has the potential to be developed as a high-potency alternative to IVIg. We plan to initiate a toxicology study in 2017 that will enable an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, with the FDA. We continue to identify and explore potential collaboration opportunities to further develop and commercialize this product candidate. 
M281 - Anti-FcRn Candidate 
M281 is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that blocks the neonatal Fc receptor, or FcRn. This receptor recycles IgG antibodies, enabling a long half-life. M281 blocks this receptor, effectively inhibiting the binding of IgGs and leading to the rapid clearance of IgGs, similar to what occurs in plasmapheresis. M281 exhibits high affinity to human and non-human FcRn in nonclinical studies and shows selective induction of human and non-human IgG clearance. Based on this data, we believe M281 has the potential for use as acute and chronic/intermittent therapies in a broad range of autoantibody driven disease. 
A Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of M281 was initiated in June 2016. In January 2017, we announced that we had successfully completed five cohorts in the Phase 1 single ascending dose, or SAD, study in healthy volunteers. In the SAD portion of the study, a single dose of 30 mg/kg achieved up to 80% reduction in circulating IgG antibodies, and M281 was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events observed. The multiple ascending portion of the study was initiated in January 2017. We plan to report the full data from the single and multiple ascending dose portions of the study in the second half of 2017.
M230 - Selective Immunomodulator of Fc receptors (SIF3) Candidate
M230, a selective immunomodulator of Fc receptors, or SIF3, is a novel homogenous recombinant Fc multimer containing three IgG Fc regions joined carefully to maximize activity. The multiple Fc domains of immune complexes aggregate Fcγ receptors, or FcγRs, triggering cellular activation processes that play critical roles in inflammation and tissue damage. The development of therapeutics that broadly antagonize FcγRs has been hampered by a limited understanding of the molecular determinants directing FcγRs activation. Through the engineering and characterization of oligomeric Fc structures we believe we have novel insights into FcγRs modulation for the development of M230. Nonclinical data has shown that M230 enhances the molecules' avidity and affinity for the Fc receptors matching the potency and efficacy of IVIg at significantly lower doses. 
On January 5, 2017, we entered into a License and Option Agreement, which became effective on February 17, 2017, with CSL Behring Recombinant Facility AG, or CSL, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of CSL Limited, pursuant to which we have granted CSL an exclusive worldwide license to research, develop, and commercialize M230. We and CSL plan to advance this candidate with a goal of beginning clinical development in 2017. The terms of our CSL collaboration are further discussed below under "Collaborations, Licenses and Asset Purchases-CSL." 
Necuparanib— Former Oncology Product Candidate
In August 2016, following the outcome of a planned futility analysis, we discontinued development of necuparanib, an oncology product candidate then being studied in a Phase 2 clinical trial. 
Collaborations, Licenses and Asset Purchases
Sandoz
In 2006 and 2007, we entered into a series of agreements, including a collaboration and license agreement, as amended, or the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement, with Sandoz and a stock purchase agreement and an investor rights agreement with Novartis. Under the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement, we and Sandoz agreed to exclusively collaborate on the development and commercialization of GLATOPA, among other products. Costs, including development costs and the costs of clinical studies, will be borne by the parties in varying proportions depending on the type of expense. For GLATOPA, we are generally responsible for all of the development costs in the United States. For GLATOPA outside of the United States, we share development costs in proportion to our profit sharing interest. We are reimbursed at a contractual FTE rate for any full-time equivalent employee expenses as well as any external costs incurred in the development of products to the extent 
9


development costs are born by Sandoz. All commercialization costs will be borne by Sandoz as they are incurred for all products.
Sandoz commenced sales of GLATOPA 20 mg/mL in the United States on June 18, 2015. Under the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement, we earn 50% of contractually-defined profits on Sandoz' worldwide net sales of GLATOPA 20 mg/mL. We are entitled to earn 50% of contractually-defined profits on Sandoz' worldwide net sales of GLATOPA 40 mg/mL, if and when GLATOPA 40 mg/mL is commercialized. Profits on net sales of GLATOPA are calculated by deducting from net sales the costs of goods sold and an allowance for selling, general and administrative costs, which is a contractual percentage of net sales. With respect to GLATOPA, Sandoz is responsible for funding all of the legal expenses incurred under the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement, except for our FTE costs with respect to certain legal activities for GLATOPA; however, a portion of certain legal expenses, including any patent infringement damages, can be offset by Sandoz against the profit-sharing amounts in proportion to our 50% profit sharing interest. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we earned a $10 million regulatory milestone payment upon GLATOPA 20 mg/mL receiving sole FDA approval and an additional $10 million milestone payment upon the first commercial sale of GLATOPA 20 mg/mL. We are eligible to receive up to $120 million in additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain commercial and sales-based milestones for GLATOPA in the United States. None of these payments, once received, is refundable and there are no general rights of return in the arrangement. Sandoz has agreed to indemnify us for various claims, and a certain portion of such costs may be offset against certain future payments received by us.
Under the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement, each party has granted the other an exclusive license under its intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize such products for all medical indications in the relevant regions. We have agreed to provide development and related services on a commercially reasonable best-efforts basis, which includes developing a manufacturing process to make the products, scaling up the process, contributing to the preparation of regulatory filings, further scaling up the manufacturing process to commercial scale, and related development of intellectual property. We have the right to participate in a joint steering committee, which is responsible for overseeing development, legal and commercial activities and which prepares and approves the annual collaboration plans. Sandoz is responsible for commercialization activities and exclusively distributes and markets the products.
The term of the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement extends throughout the development and commercialization of the products until the last sale of the products, unless earlier terminated by either party pursuant to the provisions of the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement. The 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement may be terminated if either party breaches the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement or files for bankruptcy. In addition, either we or Sandoz may terminate the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement with respect to GLATOPA 40 mg/mL, if clinical trials are required for regulatory approval of GLATOPA 40 mg/mL.
Under the stock purchase agreement, we sold approximately 4.7 million shares of our common stock to Novartis for an aggregate purchase price of $75 million, representing a premium of $13.6 million based on the closing price of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of purchase. As of December 31, 2016, Novartis had sold all of its shares of our common stock. 
Mylan
We and Mylan, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Mylan N.V., entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Mylan Collaboration Agreement, which became effective on February 9, 2016, pursuant to which we and Mylan agreed to collaborate exclusively, on a worldwide basis, to develop, manufacture and commercialize six of our biosimilar candidates, including M834.
Under the terms of the Mylan Collaboration Agreement, Mylan paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $45 million. In addition, we and Mylan agreed to share equally costs (including development, manufacturing, commercialization and certain legal expenses) and profits (losses) with respect to such product candidates, with Mylan funding its share of collaboration expenses incurred by us, in part, through up to six contingent early development milestone payments, totaling up to $200 million across the six product candidates.
For each product candidate other than M834, at a specified stage of early development, we and Mylan will each decide, based on the product candidate's development progress and commercial considerations, whether to continue the development, manufacture and commercialization of such product candidate under the collaboration or to terminate the collaboration with respect to such product candidate. If one party decides not to continue development, manufacture and commercialization of a product candidate under the Mylan Collaboration Agreement, the other party will have the right to continue the development, manufacture and commercialization of such product candidate.
Under the Mylan Collaboration Agreement, we granted Mylan an exclusive license under our intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the product candidates for all therapeutic indications, and Mylan has granted us a 
10


co-exclusive license under Mylan's intellectual property rights for us to perform our development and manufacturing activities under the product work plans agreed by the parties, and to perform certain commercialization activities to be agreed by the Joint Steering Committee, or JSC, for such product candidates if we exercise our co-commercialization option described below. We and Mylan have established a JSC consisting of an equal number of members from us and Mylan, to oversee and manage the development, manufacture and commercialization of product candidates under the collaboration. Unless otherwise determined by the JSC, it is anticipated that, in collaboration with the other party, (a) we will be primarily responsible for nonclinical development activities and initial clinical development activities for the product candidates; additional (pivotal or phase 3 equivalent) clinical development activities for M834; and regulatory activities for the product candidates in the United States through regulatory approval; and (b) Mylan will be primarily responsible for additional (pivotal or phase 3 equivalent) clinical development activities for the product candidates other than M834; regulatory activities for the product candidates outside the United States; and regulatory activities for products in the United States after regulatory approval, when all marketing authorizations for the products in the United States will be transferred to Mylan. Mylan will commercialize any approved products, with us having an option to co-commercialize, in a supporting commercial role, any approved products in the United States. The JSC will allocate responsibilities for other activities under the collaboration.
The term of the collaboration will continue throughout the development and commercialization of the product candidates, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until development and commercialization by or on behalf of us and Mylan pursuant to the Mylan Collaboration Agreement has ceased for a continuous period of two years for a given product candidate in a given country, unless earlier terminated by either party pursuant to the terms of the Mylan Collaboration Agreement.
The Mylan Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by either party for breach by, or bankruptcy of, the other party; for its convenience; or for certain activities involving competing products or the challenge of certain patents. Other than in the case of a termination for convenience, the terminating party shall have the right to continue the development, manufacture and commercialization of the terminated products in the terminated countries. In the case of a termination for convenience, the other party shall have the right to continue. If a termination occurs, the licenses granted to the non-continuing party for the applicable product will terminate for the terminated country. Subject to certain terms and conditions, the party that has the right to continue the development, manufacture or commercialization of a given product candidate may retain royalty-bearing licenses to certain intellectual property rights, and rights to certain data, for the continued development and sale of the applicable product in the country or countries for which termination applies. 
CSL 
We and CSL Behring Recombinant Facility AG, or CSL, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of CSL Limited, entered into a License and Option Agreement, or the CSL License Agreement, which became effective on February 17, 2017, or the Effective Date, pursuant to which we granted CSL an exclusive worldwide license to research, develop, and commercialize our M230 pre-clinical product candidate, an Fc multimer protein that is a selective immunomodulator of the Fc receptor. The CSL License Agreement also provides, on an exclusive basis, for us and CSL to conduct research on other Fc multimer proteins, and provides CSL the right to develop and commercialize these additional research products globally. 
Pursuant to the CSL License Agreement, CSL has agreed to pay us a non-refundable upfront payment of $50 million. For the development and commercialization of M230, we are eligible to receive up to $550 million in contingent clinical, regulatory and sales milestone payments, and additional negotiated milestone payments for a named research stage product should that enter development. We are also entitled to sales-based royalty payments in percentages ranging from a mid-single digit to low-double digits for M230 and a named research stage product should that enter development and be commercialized, and royalties and development milestone payments to be negotiated for any other products developed under the CSL License Agreement. Sales milestones are based on aggregated sales across M230 and any other products developed under the CSL License Agreement. We also have the option to participate in a cost-and-profit sharing arrangement, under which we would fund 50% of global research and development costs and 50% of U.S. commercialization costs for all products developed pursuant to the CSL License Agreement, or the Co-Funded Products, in exchange for either a 50% share of U.S. profits or 30% share of U.S. profits, determined by the stage of development at which we make such election. For Co-Funded Products, royalties remain payable for territories outside of the United States and milestone payments are reduced. We also have the right to opt-out of such arrangement at our sole discretion, which would result in milestone payments and royalties reverting to their pre-arrangement amounts. We also have the option to participate in the promotion of Co-Funded Products in the United States, subject to a co-promotion agreement to be negotiated with CSL. 
Under the CSL License Agreement, we have granted CSL an exclusive license under our intellectual property to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize product candidates for all therapeutic indications. CSL has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license under CSL’s intellectual property for our research and development activities pursuant to the CSL License Agreement and our commercialization activities under any co-promotion agreement with CSL. 
11


We and CSL will form a joint steering committee, or JSC, consisting of an equal number of members from Momenta and CSL, to facilitate the research, development, and commercialization of product candidates. 
Unless earlier terminated, the term of the CSL License Agreement commenced on the Effective Date and will continue until the later of (i) the expiration of all payment obligations with respect to products under the CSL License Agreement, (ii) we are no longer co-funding development or commercialization of any products and (iii) we and CSL are not otherwise collaborating on the development and commercialization of products or product candidates. CSL may terminate the CSL License Agreement on a product-by-product basis subject to notice periods and certain circumstances related to clinical development. We may terminate the CSL License Agreement under certain circumstances related to the development of M230 and if no activities are being conducted under the CSL License Agreement. Either party may terminate the CSL License Agreement (i) on a product-by-product basis if certain patent challenges are made, (ii) on a product-by-product or country-by-country basis for material breaches, or (iii) due to the other party’s bankruptcy. Upon termination of the CSL License Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, the licenses granted under the CSL License Agreement terminate. In addition, dependent upon the circumstances under which the CSL License Agreement is terminated, we or CSL have the right to continue the research, development, and commercialization of terminated products, including rights to certain data, for the continued development and sale of terminated products and, subject to certain limitations, obligations to make sales-based royalty payments to the other party. 
CSL's obligations under the CSL License Agreement are guaranteed by its parent company, CSL Limited.
Baxalta
We and Baxter International, Inc., Baxter Healthcare Corporation and Baxter Healthcare SA (or collectively referred to as Baxter) entered into a global collaboration and license agreement, or the Baxter Collaboration Agreement, effective February 2012, to develop and commercialize biosimilars, including M923. In connection with Baxter's internal corporate restructuring in July 2015, Baxter assigned the Baxter Collaboration Agreement to Baxalta U.S. Inc., Baxalta GmbH and Baxalta Incorporated (or collectively referred to as Baxalta). Subsequent to the assignment, we refer to "Baxter" as "Baxalta" and the "Baxter Collaboration Agreement" as the "Baxalta Collaboration Agreement." On September 27, 2016, Baxalta gave us twelve months’ prior written notice of the exercise of its right to terminate for its convenience the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement. On December 31, 2016, we and Baxalta entered into an asset return and termination agreement, or the Baxalta Termination Agreement, which made the termination of the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement effective as of December 31, 2016.
Under the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement, we and Baxalta agreed to collaborate, on a worldwide basis, on the development and commercialization of M923 and M834, and Baxalta had the right to select four additional reference products to target for biosimilar development under the collaboration. In July 2012, Baxalta selected an additional product candidate and in December 2013, following an internal portfolio review, terminated its option to license the product candidate. In February 2015, Baxalta's right to select additional programs expired without further exercise. Also, in February 2015, Baxalta terminated in part the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement as it related to M834 and all worldwide development and commercialization rights for M834 reverted to us. 
Under the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement, each party granted the other an exclusive license under its intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize M923 for all therapeutic indications. We agreed to provide development and related services on a commercially reasonable basis through the filing of an IND or equivalent application in the European Union for M923. Development and related services included high-resolution analytics, characterization, and product and process development. Baxalta was responsible for clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for M923. We had the right to participate in a joint steering committee, consisting of an equal number of members from us and Baxalta, to oversee and manage the development and commercialization of M923 under the collaboration. Costs, including development costs, payments to third parties for intellectual property licenses, and expenses for legal proceedings, including the patent exchange process pursuant to the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, was to be borne by the parties in varying proportions, depending on the type of expense and the stage of development. We were generally responsible for research and process development costs prior to filing an IND or equivalent application in the European Union, and the cost of in-human clinical trials, manufacturing in accordance with current good manufacturing practices and commercialization was borne by Baxalta. 
Under the terms of the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement, we received an initial cash payment of $33 million, a $7 million license payment for achieving pre-defined "minimum development criteria" for M834, and $12 million in technical and development milestone payments in connection with the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency's acceptance of Baxalta's clinical trial application to initiate a pharmacokinetic clinical trial for M923. We were reimbursed at a contractual FTE rate for any FTE employee expenses and external development costs for reimbursable activities related to M923. Had M923 been successfully developed and launched under the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement, Baxalta would have been required to pay us royalties on net sales of licensed products worldwide, with a base royalty rate in the high single digits 
12


with the potential for significant tiered increases based on the number of competitors, the interchangeability of the product, and the sales tier for the product. The maximum royalty with all potential increases would have been slightly more than double the base royalty.
On June 3, 2016, Baxalta Incorporated and Shire plc, or Shire, announced the completion of the combination of Baxalta Incorporated and Shire. As a result of the combination, Baxalta Incorporated, of which Baxalta US Inc. and Baxalta GmbH are wholly-owned subsidiaries, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shire. On September 27, 2016, Baxalta gave us twelve months’ prior written notice of the exercise of its right to terminate for its convenience the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement. Under the terms of the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement, the effective date of the termination was twelve months following the date Baxalta gave the termination notice, as more particularly set forth in the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement. As of the termination effective date, (i) Baxalta was obligated to transfer to us all ongoing regulatory, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities and related records for M923 and, at our request, assign to us any third party agreements reasonably necessary for and primarily related to the development, manufacture, and commercialization of M923 to the extent permitted by the agreements' terms, (ii) the licenses granted pursuant to the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement by us to Baxalta under our intellectual property rights relating to M923 would terminate, the licenses granted pursuant to the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement by Baxalta to us under Baxalta’s intellectual property rights relating to M923 would survive, and Baxalta was obligated to grant to us additional licenses under Baxalta’s intellectual property rights relating to M923 existing as of the termination effective date, and (iii) we were obligated to pay to Baxalta a royalty of 5% of net sales, as such term is defined in the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement, until Baxalta’s development expenses and commercialization costs, as such terms are defined in the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement, occurring through the termination effective date were reimbursed. Following receipt of the termination notice, we were no longer eligible to receive any regulatory milestone payments under the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement. Prior to the termination effective date, Baxalta was obligated to continue to perform development and manufacturing activities for M923.
On December 31, 2016, we and Baxalta entered into the Baxalta Termination Agreement, amending certain termination provisions of the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement. Under the terms of the Baxalta Termination Agreement, the termination of the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement was effective December 31, 2016. Baxalta was relieved of its obligations to continue to perform development, manufacturing or commercialization activities for M923 after December 31, 2016, except for certain clinical and regulatory activities that are expected to be completed by April 2017, which we refer to as the Transition Services. In order to fund the other activities that it would have been required to perform under the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement through the original termination effective date, in January 2017, Baxalta paid us a one-time cash payment of $51.2 million. Under the termination provisions of the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement, following the commercialization of M923, we are obligated to pay to Baxalta a royalty of 5% of M923's net sales (as such term is defined in the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement) until the combined total amount of Baxalta’s development expenses and commercialization costs (as such terms are defined in the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement) are reimbursed. Effective December 31, 2016, under the Baxalta Termination Agreement, this royalty obligation covers Baxalta's actual development expenses and commercialization costs incurred through December 31, 2016, plus Baxalta's costs incurred in providing the Transition Services and plus the $51.2 million payment we received in January 2017. The licenses granted pursuant to the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement by us to Baxalta under our intellectual property rights relating to M923 terminated as of December 31, 2016, except solely to the extent reasonably necessary or useful for Baxalta to perform the Transition Services. The licenses granted by Baxalta to us under its intellectual property rights relating to M923 survive, and Baxalta has granted to us licenses under additional Baxalta intellectual property rights, if any, relating to M923 existing upon completion of the Transition Services. The Baxalta Termination Agreement also assigned to us certain third party agreements relating to the development, manufacture, and commercialization of M923.
Parivid
In April 2007, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Parivid, LLC, or Parivid, a provider of data integration and analysis services to us, and S. Raguram, the principal owner and Chief Technology Officer of Parivid. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, which was amended in August 2009 and July 2011, we acquired certain of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Parivid related to the acquired assets in exchange for $2.5 million in cash paid at closing and up to $11.0 million in contingent milestone payments in a combination of cash and/or stock in the manner and on the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement if certain milestones are achieved within 15 years of the date of the purchase agreement. In August 2016, we paid the final milestone payment under the purchase agreement by issuing 265,605 shares of our common stock to Parivid upon GLATOPA 20 mg/mL remaining the sole generic COPAXONE 20 mg/mL product on the U.S. market for one-year following its commercial launch in June 2016.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
13


Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our technology and product candidates, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology and product candidates that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
We license or own a patent portfolio of around 150 patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents as well as foreign counterparts to certain of the United States patents and patent applications. Our patent portfolio includes issued or pending claims covering:

• | methods and technologies for characterizing complex generics and biosimilars, including our biosimilar HUMIRA candidate and our biosimilar ORENCIA candidate;


• | methods for manufacturing complex generics and biosimilars, including our biosimilar HUMIRA candidate and our biosimilar ORENCIA candidate;


• | composition of matter, methods of use, and methods of making novel therapeutics for autoimmune disease, including our novel product candidates such as M230, M281 and M254;


• | composition of matter, methods of use, and methods of making certain novel low molecular weight heparins;


• | composition of matter and use of certain heparinases, heparinase variants and other enzymes; and


• | methods and technologies for the analysis and synthesis of polysaccharides.

The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents. Moreover, any issued patent does not guarantee us the right to practice the patented technology or to commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented products and practicing our patented technology. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our generic, biosimilar and novel products. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate facilities for commercial scale manufacturing of our products. We do own a process development scale manufacturing facility used in the development of our biologics. While we have personnel with experience and expertise in manufacturing, as well as process development, analytical development, quality assurance and quality control, we rely on contract manufacturers and our collaboration partners for manufacturing and supply activities. Under the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement, Sandoz is responsible for commercial manufacture of GLATOPA. Under the Mylan Collaboration Agreement, we and Mylan will jointly oversee manufacturing activities, with us having primary responsibility for contracting with contract manufacturers for clinical supply for products and Mylan having primary responsibility for contracting with contract manufacturers for commercial supply for products other than M834. Under the CSL License Agreement, CSL is responsible for manufacturing activities, except that we are responsible, at CSL's direction, for contracting with contract manufacturers for certain clinical supply of M230.
14


We have entered into various agreements with third party contractors for process development, analytical services and manufacturing. In each of our agreements with contractors, we retain ownership of our intellectual property and generally own and/or are assigned ownership of processes, developments, data, results and other intellectual property generated during the course of the performance of each agreement that primarily relate to our products. Where applicable, we are granted non-exclusive licenses to certain contractor intellectual property for purposes of exploiting the products that are the subject of the agreement and in a few instances we grant non-exclusive licenses to the contract manufacturers for use outside of our product area. The agreements also typically contain provisions for both parties to terminate for material breach, bankruptcy and insolvency.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
We do not currently have any sales, marketing and distribution capabilities other than strategic sales and marketing expertise, nor do we currently have any plans to build a sales, marketing and distribution capability to support any of our products. While we have personnel with experience and expertise in sales and marketing, we rely on our collaboration partners for these activities. In order for us to commercialize any products we would have to either develop a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure or collaborate or contract with third parties that have sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. Under the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement, Sandoz is responsible for commercializing GLATOPA. Under the Mylan Collaboration Agreement, we have an option to participate in the commercialization of products, in a supporting commercial role, with Mylan in the United States. Under the CSL License Agreement, CSL is responsible for commercialization of products and we have an option to co-promote products in the United States. 
Regulatory and Legal Matters
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, the European Union and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and exporting and importing of products such as those we are developing.
United States Government Regulation
In the United States, the information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain market approval of a new drug or biologic varies depending on whether the drug or biologic is a new product whose safety and effectiveness has not previously been demonstrated in humans, or a drug or biologic whose active ingredient(s) and certain other properties are the same as those of a previously approved drug or biologic, i.e., biosimilar. Approval of new drugs and biologics follows the NDA and BLA routes, respectively. A drug that claims to be the same as an already approved NDA drug may be able to file for approval under the ANDA approval pathway. Beginning in 2010, with the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCI Act, a biosimilar may also be filed for approval under the abbreviated pathway under Section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act.
ANDA Approval Process for Generics
FDA approval is required before a generic equivalent of an existing brand name drug may be marketed. Such approval is typically obtained by submitting an ANDA to the FDA and demonstrating therapeutic equivalence. However, it is within the FDA's regulatory discretion to determine the kind and amount of evidence required to approve a product for marketing. An ANDA may be submitted for a drug on the basis that it is the same as a previously approved branded drug, also known as a reference listed drug. Specifically, the generic drug that is the subject of the ANDA must have the same active ingredient(s), route of administration, dosage form, and strength, as well as the same labeling, with certain exceptions, and the labeling must prescribe conditions of use that have been previously approved for the listed drug. If the generic drug product has a different route of administration, dosage form, or strength, the FDA must grant a suitability petition approving the differences(s) from the listed drug before the ANDA may be filed. The ANDA must also contain data and information demonstrating that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the listed drug (or alternatively seek a waiver as is requested for most injectable products), or if the application is submitted pursuant to an approved suitability petition, information to show that the listed drug and the generic drug can be expected to have the same therapeutic effect when administered to patients for a proposed condition of use.
Generic drug applications are termed "abbreviated" because they are not required to duplicate the clinical (human) testing or, generally, nonclinical testing necessary to establish the underlying safety and effectiveness of the branded product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. However, the FDA may refuse to approve an ANDA if there is insufficient information to show that the active ingredients are the same and to demonstrate that any impurities or differences in active ingredients do not affect the safety or efficacy of the generic product. In addition, like NDAs, an ANDA will not be approved 
15


unless the product is manufactured in current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, compliant facilities to assure and preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity. As is the case for NDAs and BLAs, the FDA may refuse to accept and review insufficiently complete ANDAs.
Generally, in an ANDA submission, determination of the "sameness" of the active ingredients to those in the reference listed drug is based on the demonstration of the chemical equivalence of the components of the generic version to those of the branded product. While the standard for demonstrating chemical equivalence is relatively straightforward for small molecule drugs, it is inherently more difficult to define sameness for the active ingredients of complex drugs. Under the NDA pathway, these types of drugs include products such as recombinant versions of certain hormones, among others. Due to the limited number of ANDA submissions for generic complex drugs, the FDA has not reached a final position for demonstrating chemical equivalence for many of these products specifically, nor provided broad guidance for achieving "sameness" for complex drugs in general. In many cases, the criteria the FDA may apply are evolving and are being determined on an application-by-application basis.
To demonstrate bioequivalence, ANDAs generally must also contain in vivo bioavailability data for the generic and branded drugs. "Bioavailability" indicates the rate and extent of absorption and levels of concentration of a drug product in the bloodstream needed to produce a therapeutic effect. "Bioequivalence" compares the bioavailability of one drug product with another, and when established, indicates that the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of a generic drug in the body are the same as the previously approved branded drug. The studies required to demonstrate in vivo bioequivalence are generally very small, quick to complete, and involve relatively few subjects. Under current regulations, the FDA may waive requirements for in vivo bioequivalence data for certain drug products, including products where bioequivalence is self-evident such as injectable solutions which have been shown to contain the same active and inactive ingredients as the reference listed drug. Although the FDA may waive requirements for in vivo bioequivalence data, it may still require the submission of alternative data on purity, such as immunogenicity and/or pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data, to provide additional evidence of pharmaceutical equivalence. The FDA, however, does not always waive requirements for in vivo bioequivalence data.
Generic drug products that are found to be therapeutically equivalent by the FDA receive an "A" rating in FDA's Orange Book, which lists all approved drug products and therapeutic equivalence evaluations. Products that are therapeutically equivalent can be expected in the FDA's judgment to have equivalent clinical effect and no difference in their potential for adverse effects when used under the approved conditions of their approved labeling. Products with "A" ratings are generally substitutable for the innovator drug by both in-hospital and retail pharmacies. Many health insurance plans require automatic substitution for "A" rated generic versions of products when they are available, although physicians may still prescribe the branded drug for individual patients. On rare occasions in the past, generic products were approved that were not rated as therapeutically equivalent, and these products were generally not substitutable at retail pharmacies. Therapeutic equivalence ratings are used under Medicare to determine reimbursement for generic drugs and facilitate market uptake of generic drugs.
The timing of final FDA approval of a generic drug for commercial distribution depends on a variety of factors, including whether the applicant challenges any listed patents for the drug and/or its use and whether the manufacturer of the branded product is entitled to one or more statutory periods of non-patent regulatory exclusivity, during which the FDA is prohibited from accepting or approving generic product applications. For example, submission of an ANDA for a drug that was approved under an NDA as a new chemical entity will be blocked for five years after the pioneer's approval or for four years after approval if the application includes a paragraph IV certification of non-infringement or invalidity against a patent applicable to the branded drug. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block ANDAs from being approved on or after the patent expiration date. For example, a three-year exclusivity period may be granted for new indications, dosage forms, routes of administration, or strengths of previously approved drugs, or for new uses, if approval of such changes required the sponsor to conduct new clinical studies. In addition, the FDA may extend the exclusivity of a product by six months past the date of patent expiry or other regulatory exclusivity if the manufacturer undertakes studies on the effect of their product in children, a so-called pediatric exclusivity.
The brand manufacturer may seek to delay or prevent the approval of an ANDA by filing a Citizen Petition or other forms of comments with the FDA. For example, a Citizen Petition may request the FDA to rule that a determination of "sameness" and/or therapeutic equivalence for a particular ANDA is not possible without extensive clinical testing, based on the characteristics of the brand product. Because relatively few ANDAs for complex mixture drugs have been reviewed by FDA, such a petition could substantially delay approval, or result in non-approval, of an ANDA for a complex mixture generic product. For example, Teva filed a Citizen Petition that argued that "sameness" could not be established by any applicant filing an ANDA for a generic COPAXONE on the grounds that COPAXONE was too complex to be thoroughly characterized. The FDA denied Teva's petition in connection with the approval of the ANDA for GLATOPA 20 mg/mL. The review of the Citizen Petition or other comments filed with the FDA and the preparation of the FDA response, however, can involve significant legal and regulatory resources that may extend the time for FDA review and approval of an ANDA.
Patent Challenge Process Regarding ANDAs
16


The Hatch-Waxman Act provides incentives for generic pharmaceutical manufacturers to challenge patents on branded pharmaceutical products and/or their methods of use, as well as to develop products comprising non-infringing forms of the patented drugs. The Hatch-Waxman legislation places significant burdens on the ANDA filer to ensure that such challenges are not frivolous, but also offers the opportunity for significant financial reward if the challenge is successful.
If there is a patent listed for the branded drug in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence and Evaluations listing or "Orange Book" at the time of submission of the ANDA, or at any time before the ANDA is approved, the generic manufacturer's ANDA must include one of four types of patent certification with respect to each listed patent. If the applicant seeks approval to market the generic equivalent prior to the expiration of a listed patent, the generic company includes a certification asserting that the patent is invalid or unenforceable or will not be infringed, a so-called "paragraph IV certification." Within 20 days after receiving notice from the FDA that its application is acceptable for review, or immediately if the ANDA has been amended to include a paragraph IV certification after the application was submitted to the FDA, the generic applicant is required to send the patent owner and the holder of the NDA for the brand-name drug notice explaining why it believes that the listed patents in question are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. If the patent holder commences a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of such notice, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for an automatic stay on the FDA's ability to grant final approval of the ANDA for the generic product, generally for a period of 30 months. A 30-month stay may be shortened or lengthened by a court order if the district court finds that a party has failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting the action. Moreover, the district court may, before expiration of the stay, issue a preliminary injunction prohibiting the commercial sale of the generic drug until the court rules on the issues of validity, infringement, and enforceability. If the district court finds that the relevant patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, such ruling terminates the 30-month stay on the date of the judgment. If it is finally determined that the patent is valid, enforceable, and infringed, approval of the ANDA may not be granted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, if the challenged patent expires during the 30-month period, the FDA may grant final approval for the generic drug for marketing, if the FDA has determined that the application meets all technical and regulatory requirements for approval and there are no other obstacles to approval.
In most cases, patent holders may only obtain one 30-month stay with respect to patents listed in the Orange Book. Specifically, for ANDAs with paragraph IV certifications to a patent listed for the branded drug in the Orange Book on or after August 18, 2003, a single 30-month stay is available for litigation related to that patent only if the patent was submitted to the FDA before the date that the ANDA (excluding an amendment or supplement) was submitted. In other words, 30-months stays are not triggered by later listed patents submitted to the FDA on or after the date the ANDA application was submitted. Because of this limitation, in most cases ANDAs will be subject to no more than one 30-month stay.
Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the first ANDA applicant to have submitted a substantially complete ANDA that includes a paragraph IV certification may be eligible to receive a 180-day period of generic market exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other ANDA for the same drug product. However, this exclusivity does not prevent the sponsor of the innovator drug from selling an unbranded "authorized generic" version of its own product during the 180-day exclusivity period. This period of market exclusivity may provide the patent challenger with the opportunity to earn a return on the risks taken and its legal and development costs and to build its market share before other generic competitors can enter the market. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, as amended by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, there are a number of ways an applicant who has filed an ANDA after the date of the MMA may forfeit its 180-day exclusivity, including if the ANDA is withdrawn or if the applicant fails to market its product within the specified statutory timeframe or achieve at least tentative approval within the specified timeframe. In addition, for ANDAs filed after the MMA was enacted, it is possible for more than one ANDA applicant to be eligible for 180-day exclusivity. This occurs when multiple "first" applicants submit substantially complete ANDAs with paragraph IV certifications on the same day.
Approval Process for Biosimilars
With the enactment of federal healthcare reform legislation in 2010, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCI Act, was enacted which created a new abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars. The abbreviated pathway is codified in Section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act. Under Section 351(k), the FDA must wait four years after approval of a product under a BLA before accepting a filing for a biosimilar version of the reference product, and the FDA cannot approve a biosimilar version of the reference product until 12 years after the reference product was approved under a BLA. In addition, the new legislation redefines "biologic" versus "drug." There is a ten year transition period during which applicants can elect regulation as a drug or biologic when applications are filed. 
The Section 351(k) pathway creates a regulatory and legal pathway to encourage the development of biosimilars. First, it authorizes the FDA to rely on the safety and efficacy of a reference product approved under a BLA to approve biosimilar products under the abbreviated pathway. Second, it establishes a process for negotiation and clearance of patents controlled by the reference product BLA holder. The law defines a biosimilar product as a biologic that:
17



• | is "highly similar" to the reference product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components; and


• | has no clinically meaningful differences from the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency.

Biosimilars may be approved for one or more, and possibly all, indications for which a reference product is approved. In some cases, clinical trial data successfully demonstrating the use of a biosimilar for one indication, and submitted to support approval for that indication, may be extrapolated to support approval for one or more other indications of the reference product.
The Section 351(k) pathway further defines a subset of biosimilar products as "interchangeable" if an applicant can demonstrate that:

• | the interchangeable biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and


• | if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biologic product and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without switching.

The Section 351(k) pathway states that a biosimilar product that is determined to be interchangeable may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of a health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The law states that the biosimilar must be for the same indication as the reference product, involve the same mechanism of action and that the manufacturing facility meets the standards necessary to assure that the product continues to be safe, pure and potent. The types of data that would ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity would include:

• | analytical data and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity;


• | nonclinical studies (including toxicity studies); and


• | clinical studies.

The FDA has the discretion to determine whether one or more of these elements are necessary and its guidance to date does not establish a single method for demonstrating biosimilarity but states that the degree of residual uncertainty that remains following analytical and nonclinical research will determine the nature and the extent of clinical studies that may be required. In 2012, the FDA implemented its biosimilar user fee program which includes a fee-based meeting process for consultation between applicants and the FDA reviewing division on biosimilar and interchangeable biologics applications under the new approval pathway. It provides for pre-application meetings where the applicant can propose and submit analytic, physicochemical and biologic characterization data along with a proposed development plan. The proposed development plan may have a reduced scope of clinical development based on the nature and extent of the characterization data. There are defined time periods for meetings and written advice. Since 2012, the FDA has published a series of draft and final guidance documents for the development and registration of biosimilars and interchangeable biologics, on topics ranging from demonstrating biosimilarity and interchangeability, non-proprietary naming, labeling and other scientific and regulatory issues. The draft and final guidance documents indicate that the FDA will consider the totality-of-the-evidence developed by an applicant in determining the nature and extent of the development, nonclinical and clinical requirements for a biosimilar or interchangeable biologic product. In addition, the guidance documents confirm the importance of analytical characterization to demonstrating biosimilarity and interchangeability in showing the absence of differences from the reference product. Where differences are identified, uncertainty associated with their clinical meaning or impact is expected to be resolved by nonclinical testing and clinical trials. The greater the similarity, the less uncertainty and the more likely the FDA will authorize an applicant to conduct targeted clinical trials or use extrapolation in support of demonstrating biosimilarity and interchangeability. The BPCI Act also provides for limited regulatory exclusivity for the first FDA-approved interchangeable biologic with respect to each reference product. This means that the FDA will defer approval of additional interchangeable biologics to the same reference product for defined periods of one year or more.
Upon filing an abbreviated application, an applicant may trigger the patent negotiation and clearance process. Under the provisions, an applicant and the reference product company are required to share information to seek to resolve any patent disputes prior to regulatory approval and launch. A failure to share information or participate in the process has defined consequences that include the loss of the right to seek patent clearance on the applicant's part and the loss of the right to seek lost profits or injunctive relief for infringement on the reference product patent right holder's part. The process, if initiated by the applicant, has several stages, including defining which patents to include in a pre-approval litigation proceeding, initiating litigation, notice 180 days prior to launch of a biosimilar, the initiation of a second round of litigation relating to patents the parties did not include in the first round litigation, and, following approval, litigation on patents brought by the reference product company or other patent holders not involved in the prior patent process.

The BPCI Act is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning will be subject to uncertainty for years to come.
NDA and BLA Approval Processes for New Drugs and Biologics
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and, in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act, and implementing regulations. The steps required before a new drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States include:

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, nonclinical studies and formulation studies under the FDA's good laboratory practices;


• | completion of developmental chemistry, manufacturing and controls activities and manufacture under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must include independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval at each clinical site before the trial is initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug product for each indication or the safety, purity and potency of the biological product for its intended indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity or to meet standards designed to ensure the biologic's continued safety, purity and potency;


• | satisfactory completion of FDA inspections of nonclinical and or clinical testing sites;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.

Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as nonclinical studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical and stability data, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless, before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. Submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects or patients in accordance with specific protocols and under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs. Each clinical trial protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and an IRB at each site where the study is conducted must also approve the study. Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 trials usually involve the initial introduction of the investigational drug into humans to evaluate the product's safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. If feasible, Phase 1 studies also attempt to detect any early indication of a drug's potential effectiveness. Phase 2 trials usually involve controlled trials in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the drug for specific indications. Phase 3 trials usually test a specific hypothesis to evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety in an expanded patient population, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, an IRB or a sponsor may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA can also request that additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition of product approval. Finally, sponsors are required to publicly disseminate information about ongoing and completed clinical trials on a government website administered by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and are subject to civil money penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions for failing to meet these obligations.
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the nonclinical studies and of the clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the chemistry, manufacture and control of the 
19


product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product's continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may refuse to accept and review insufficiently complete applications.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Moreover, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval of a new NDA or BLA, or NDA or BLA supplement, before the change can be implemented.
Upon approval of a new drug or a new indication based under an NDA or a supplement to an NDA, the holder of the approval receives the benefit of protection from generic competition. As discussed above, for example, the FDA must wait at least four years before accepting a filing for approval of a generic version of the brand product under an ANDA, and the FDA cannot approve a generic version of the brand product under an ANDA until five years after the brand product was approved under the NDA. In addition, in certain circumstances where a brand product files additional data as outlined above for a new indication or use of a brand based upon new clinical studies and receives an approval, the FDA is similarly precluded from approving a generic version of the brand product for such new indication or use until three years after the new use or indication was approved by the brand.
The BPCI Act added new exclusivity provisions for reference products along with the creation of a new approval pathway for biosimilars. Under the law, the FDA must wait four years after approval of a biologic under a BLA before accepting a filing for a biosimilar of that product, and the FDA cannot approve a biosimilar of the reference product until 12 years after the reference product was approved under a BLA. In addition, the new legislation redefines the definition of biologic versus drug and, as a result, a number of products that were previously regulated as drugs may now be regulated as biologics. There is a ten year transition period during which applicants can elect regulation as a drug or as a biologic when applications are filed. This could provide an applicant that elects regulation as a biologic with the longer twelve year period of exclusivity protection as compared to the five year period of exclusivity protection against generic drug competition.
Manufacturing Requirements
Before approving an NDA, BLA, ANDA or Section 351(a) application, the FDA may inspect the facility or the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product, and may delay an approval of an application, unless or until it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, BLA, ANDA or Section 351(a) application, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
Post-Approval Requirements
After regulatory approval of a product is obtained, we are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA, BLA, ANDA or Section 351(k) application, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety or efficacy after commercialization. Any post-approval regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future.
In addition, holders of an approved NDA, BLA, ANDA or Section 351(k) approval are required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and recordkeeping requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
Discovery of problems with a product or failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an IRB of a clinical hold on or termination of studies, the FDA's refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an 
20


approval, restriction on marketing, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Also, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products in those markets. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from the applicable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Under European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorizations either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions and is available at the request of the applicant for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization from one European Union member state (the reference member state) may submit an application to the remaining member states. Generally, each member state decides whether to recognize the reference member state's approval in its own country.
Related Matters
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA or reimbursed under Medicare by the Center for Medicare Services. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Hazardous Materials
Our research and development processes involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials and chemicals, including radioactive materials and equipment. We are subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. We do not expect the cost of complying with these laws and regulations to be material.
Competition
The development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products is highly competitive due to existing product competition at the time of product launch and the development of subsequent therapeutics with different methods of action, efficacy and safety profiles. Many of our competitors, who already market or are developing products similar to those in our portfolio, have considerable experience in product development, obtaining regulatory approval, and commercializing pharmaceutical products. Further, certain of these competitive companies have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development and human resources than we do.
We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to successfully develop safe and efficacious products, the timing and scope of regulatory approval of our products and those of our competitors, our ability to collaborate with third parties, our ability to maintain favorable patent protection for our products, our ability to obtain market acceptance of our products and our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products at commercially acceptable costs.
GLATOPA
GLATOPA 20 mg/mL is a substitutable generic equivalent for, and competes directly with, Teva's once-daily COPAXONE 20 mg/mL. It also competes with Teva's three-times-weekly COPAXONE 40 mg/mL. If the ANDA for GLATOPA 40 mg/mL is approved, GLATOPA 40 mg/mL would be a substitutable generic for, and would compete directly with, Teva's three-times-weekly COPAXONE 40 mg/mL. Teva's three-times-weekly COPAXONE 40 mg/mL, which launched in early 2014, accounts for approximately 81% of the overall U.S. glatiramer acetate market (20 mg/mL and 40mg/mL) based on volume prescribed. Teva's three-times-weekly COPAXONE 40 mg/mL share of the overall glatiramer acetate market may 
21


continue to increase, which could continue to decrease the size of the 20 mg/mL glatiramer acetate market and the market potential for GLATOPA 20 mg/mL. Currently, GLATOPA 20 mg/mL is the sole approved generic for once-daily COPAXONE 20 mg/mL in the United States and, to date, there is no approved generic for three-times-weekly COPAXONE 40 mg/mL in the United States. However, we may be subject to competition from other generic versions of COPAXONE approved in the future by the FDA. ANDAs for generic versions of COPAXONE 20 mg/mL and/or 40 mg/mL have been submitted to the FDA by Mylan Inc., Synthon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, and Biocon Ltd. Other ANDAs or other regulatory applications may have been submitted or may be submitted in the future. In addition, GLATOPA 20 mg/mL competes (and GLATOPA 40 mg/mL, if approved, will compete) with other FDA approved multiple sclerosis therapies. These currently include, among others, Rebif (interferon-beta-1a), marketed by EMD Serono Inc. and Pfizer Inc.; Avonex (interferon beta-1a), Tysabri (natalizumab), Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a), and Zinbryta (daclizumab), each marketed by Biogen Idec Inc.; Betaseron (interferon-beta-1b), marketed by Bayer Schering Pharma; Extavia (interferon-Beta-1b) and Gilenya (fingolimod), each marketed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation; Lemtrada (alemtuzumab), marketed by Sanofi and Bayer; and Aubagio (teriflunomide), marketed by Sanofi.
Biosimilars
If approved, our biosimilar candidates would compete with their applicable reference products, biosimilars to those reference products, as well as other therapies used to treat the indications for which our biosimilars would be approved. Many of the companies developing biosimilars are significantly larger than us, have substantially greater financial resources and have significant pre-existing resources to devote to their biosimilars business. Amgen’s biosimilar to HUMIRA, Amjevita, received FDA approval in 2016 and a Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, positive opinion in January 2017. Currently, Sandoz, Samsung Bioepis, Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Bio., Pfizer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Biocon/Mylan, Merck KGaA, LG Life Sciences, Coherus, Innovent Biologics, Oncobiologics, Biocad, Genor/Biocnd, and Bio-Thera have biosimilars to HUMIRA in clinical development. There are two biosimilars to HUMIRA approved in India, one from Torrent Pharmaceuticals and one from Zydus Cadila. Alphamab, bioXpress, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, and Harvest Moon have announced they are developing a biosimilar to ORENCIA. 
Novel Therapeutics
Our novel product pipeline will also face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies. Our development work focused on Fc biology, which has yielded three named product candidates: M230, an Fc multimer, M281, anti-FcRn, and M254, hyper-sialylated IVIg. These candidates face competition from a number of companies. Merck & Co. and Pfizer have compounds in development that are mechanistically similar to M230. Pfizer's compound is in nonclinical development, and Merck's compound completed a Phase I clinical trial in May 2015. Several companies, including UCB, HanAll, Shire, Syntimmune and Argenx are developing FcRn targeted agents. UCB's compound is in a phase II clinical trial in ITP. Argenx’s compound is in a phase 2 trial in myasthenia gravis, and Syntimmune’s compound is in a phase I clinical trial. HanAll and Shire are in nonclinical development. M254 would compete with currently marketed intravenous and subcutaneous IgG products, including Octagam 5% and Octagam 10% marketed by Octapharma, Gammagard S/D, Gammagard Liquid 10%, Cuvitru and HyQvia marketed by Shire, Carimune, Privigen Liquid 10%, Carimune NF, and Hizentra marketed by CSL Behring, Flebogamma 5% DIF, Gamunex-C, Flebogamma 10% DIF marketed by Grifols, Gammaplex marketed by BPL Holdings, Gammaked marketed by Kendrion Biopharma, and Bivigam Liquid 10% marketed by Biotest,  as well as those that are currently in development. 
Employees
We believe that our success will depend greatly on our ability to identify, attract and retain capable employees. As of December 31, 2016, we had 290 employees, including 81 employees who hold Ph.D. degrees and one employee who holds an M.D degree. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group or labor union, and we believe our relations with our employees are good.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in identifying, developing and testing product candidates. These expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel, license fees, consulting fees, nonclinical and clinical trial costs, contract research and manufacturing costs, and the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities. Research and development expense for 2016 was $119.9 million, compared with $126.0 million in 2015 and $106.5 million in 2014.
