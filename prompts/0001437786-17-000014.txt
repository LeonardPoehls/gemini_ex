Overview
We are a clinical-stage immunotherapy company with next-generation, diversified in vivo approaches designed to enable the body’s immune system to fight disease. Although we believe our approaches have broad potential across multiple therapeutic areas, we are focused in oncology and have designed our technologies to activate the immune system’s natural ability to create tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells to fight cancer via distinct mechanisms. Our two lead product candidates, CMB305 and G100, utilize different immuno-oncology approaches that, we believe, address the shortcomings of existing therapies and have the potential to treat a broad patient population either as individual therapies or in combination with other mechanisms of action. We have also been executing a strategy to partner individual indications outside of oncology in infectious and allergic diseases, which provide potential downstream economics while preserving growth opportunity in the future.
The following is our primary oncology product development pipeline produced by our two discovery platforms, ZVex® and GLAAS®: 
CMB305: Antigen Specific, Next-Generation Cancer Vaccine
CMB305 is a prime-boost approach targeting the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen, in which a priming agent called LV305 from our ZVex platform is dosed sequentially with a boosting agent from our GLAAS platform. CMB305 is designed to induce and expand a specific, anti-tumor immune response, and is currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials in patients with soft tissue sarcoma as a monotherapy and in combination with Genentech’s cancer immunotherapy, Tecentriq® (atezolizumab, anti-PD-L1), pursuant to a collaboration with Genentech. The combination study is a randomized Phase 2 trial in which patients receive either CMB305 combined with Tecentriq or Tecentriq alone. In June 2016, we disclosed that data from a completed first-in-human dose-escalation monotherapy trial and an early subset of patients from a monotherapy expansion trial in patients with soft tissue sarcoma showed that CMB305 had a favorable safety profile with only grade 1 and 2 adverse events, or AEs, and without dose-limiting toxicities. In addition, patients who responded immunologically had a greater degree of antigen-specific T cell response than previously reported in the Phase 1 trial of LV305 alone, which is consistent with the rationale of the prime boost approach. As of December 31, 2016, neither the LV305 nor CMB305 monotherapy trials in patients with soft tissue sarcoma (23 and 25 patients, respectively) had reached a median overall survival, or OS. We continue to enroll patients in the ongoing randomized Phase 2 trial and, if afforded the opportunity, intend to present data from the trial at medical meetings beginning in the second half of 2017. We have received orphan drug designation in the US for CMB305, and in the US and EU for each component of CMB305, in each case, for soft tissue sarcoma. If the ongoing trials produce a sufficiently robust clinical benefit for patients, we plan to discuss an appropriate development path with the regulatory authorities and pursue soft tissue sarcoma as the first indication for which we would seek approval for CMB305. We are also developing a companion diagnostic in connection with our CMB305 development program to identify NY-ESO-1 expressing tumors, which test we believe would require U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approval contemporaneously with CMB305.
G100: Antigen Agnostic, Intratumoral Immune Activation
G100 was developed from the GLAAS platform and, in contrast to CMB305, does not target a specific antigen, but instead leverages the range of endogenous antigens found in the tumor microenvironment, including neoantigens. At the ASCO annual meeting in 2016, we presented data on 10 patients from a completed Phase 1 trial in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma, or MCC, which showed: (1) an objective response rate, or ORR, of 50% per protocol; (2) a favorable safety profile; and (3) that G100 significantly altered the tumor microenvironment in responding patients. We are further developing G100 as a monotherapy and combination therapy in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, or NHL, in a randomized Phase 1b/2 trial. The monotherapy portion of the trial is evaluating G100 with local radiation, and the randomized portion of the trial is evaluating G100 with local radiation and in combination with the anti-PD-1 agent, KEYTRUDA®, pursuant to a collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck. If afforded the opportunity, we intend to begin to present data from this trial at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, annual meeting in 2017. We have received orphan drug designation in the United States for G100 in NHL. If the ongoing trials produce a sufficiently robust clinical benefit for patients, we plan to discuss an appropriate development path with the regulatory authorities to pursue NHL as the first indication for which we would seek approval for G100.
Our Strategy

• | Develop product candidates to treat a broad patient population. We believe our product candidates should benefit a wide range of patients in both orphan diseases and large indications because they are designed to create tumor-killing

1

CTLs, could potentially target any tumor and have potential utility as both individual and multiple combination therapies.

• | Rapidly advance first-in-class immuno-oncology product candidates through clinical development. We intend to continue to execute a focused clinical development plan that takes selected product candidates through approval. We are initially focused on indications with a significant unmet need in targeted patient populations, such as CMB305 in soft tissue sarcoma. We are currently focusing our initial development efforts on CMB305 and G100.


• | Leverage our platforms’ ability to address multiple tumor types to build a robust product pipeline. Our ZVex and GLAAS platforms allow us to select both conserved tumor antigens and neoantigens and create separate product candidates to potentially treat any tumor type. We believe this ability, and the potential of our vectors to simultaneously express antigens and immuno-regulatory molecules, will be a driver of our future growth beyond the current product candidates.


• | Position Immune Design to potentially play a broad role in the immuno-oncology treatment paradigm. Our agents are designed to work individually, together, and with multiple other mechanisms of action. In addition to our ongoing clinical collaborations combining CMB305 and G100 with checkpoint inhibitors, we intend to explore additional combinations with other immuno-oncology approaches to demonstrate this broad potential benefit.


• | Selectively monetize non-oncology indications, while retaining optionality for future internal development. Both ZVex and GLAAS also have potential application beyond oncology. We have licensed the right to use the GLAAS platform in specific infectious and allergic disease indications to large pharmaceutical companies. These collaborations provide us with both near- and long-term potential revenue and external validation of our technology, while preserving optionality for future growth beyond oncology.


• | Establish infrastructure and capabilities to support the future commercialization of our products. Our management team has extensive experience developing and/or commercializing pharmaceutical products and as our product candidates advance, we intend to add the appropriate additional regulatory and commercial expertise to maximize the potential for successful product launches and franchise management. In certain instances, we will seek partners to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates.

ZVex and GLAAS: Productive Product Discovery Platforms
We believe our approach to fighting cancer is the first of its kind. We utilize ZVex and GLAAS to develop product candidates that work in vivo and are designed to create and expand diverse armies of immune cells known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes, or CTLs, to fight tumors. An in vivo approach is preferred because it addresses both the cumbersome administration and the need for patient customization inherent in ex vivo approaches, such as engineered CD8 T cells. Although they have distinct mechanisms of action, we designed both CMB305 and G100 to convert “cold” tumors, or those without CTLs, to “hot” tumors, or those with CTLs specific for the antigens expressed by the tumor. Although they are designed to share this effect on tumors, the agents have distinct mechanisms of action and may produce different clinical benefit profiles. For example, it has been noted in literature that although a cancer vaccine therapy may not result in an immediate or early change in tumor burden like cytotoxic approaches such as chemotherapy, a vaccine may induce a delayed anti-tumor response resulting in longer survival than that seen with the cytotoxic approach. Similarly, and based on our clinical studies to date, we believe that although we may not observe a short-term surrogate endpoint like ORR or PFS, ZVex-based cancer vaccines such as CMB305 may nonetheless confer a potentially meaningful overall survival, or OS, benefit in these patients. In contrast, G100’s distinct mechanism of action may produce an ORR as we observed in the MCC Phase 1 trial.
The fundamental discoveries underlying ZVex originated with one of our founders, Nobel laureate David Baltimore, Ph.D. Dr. Baltimore and his colleagues theorized that a lentivirus, which is a virus that works in immune cells such as dendritic cells, or DCs, could be engineered to selectively deliver the specific genetic information of a tumor marker, called an antigen, directly to DCs in the skin. The expression of this antigen would trigger an immune response of CTLs to eliminate the tumor. In comparison, the core of the GLAAS platform is a potent synthetic stimulator of a specific cellular receptor called TLR4 that is present in DCs. Activation of DCs through TLR4 can safely trigger an anti-tumor immune response and synergize with either pre-existing CTLs or those generated by ZVex for what we believe will be a greater degree of tumor killing than either approach alone. We believe ZVex- and GLAAS-based product candidates have both monotherapy and broad combination potential across the oncology landscape, such as in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in our two ongoing randomized studies and with other approaches, such as engineered T cells.

ZVex is a discovery platform that uses a first-in-class vector to generate product candidates designed to create CTLs in vivo. CTLs are essential because their primary function is the selective recognition and destruction of tumor cells. The ZVex vector is a delivery system based on a re-engineered virus designed to carry the genetic information of selected tumor antigen(s) (in whole or selected epitopes) safely and selectively to DCs in the skin. We believe that DCs are the most important immune cells to target because they initiate the specific immune response that generates CTLs to kill the tumor. When injected into a cancer patient, a ZVex-based product candidate is designed to interact only with these DCs, delivering the tumor antigen(s) in the form of RNA. The DC then processes the RNA into a protein, splits it and presents the protein fragments outside of the cell to neighboring resting CD8 T cells, which then activate to become fully functional CD8+ CTLs. When a CD8 T cell is activated and starts dividing, the result is millions of CTLs that will kill tumor cells bearing that same specific tumor antigen epitope. ZVex product candidates have the potential to carry the genetic material of different tumor antigens, including neoantigens, as well as immuno-modulatory agents, and therefore have the potential to target multiple types of cancers.
GLAAS, which stands for GLA Adjuvant Systems, is a discovery platform that also works in vivo and is based on a small synthetic molecule called GLA, which stands for glucopyranosyl lipid A. GLA selectively binds to the TLR4 receptor and causes potent activation of the DC. When GLA is accompanied by a tumor antigen and injected into a patient, the combination is taken up by DCs and leads to the production and expansion of immune cells called CD4 T helper lymphocytes, or CD4 T cells. Similar to CTLs, these CD4 T cells will be specific to a tumor antigen, but unlike CTLs, they generally cannot kill antigen-bearing tumor cells. They do, however, play a key role in boosting the anti-tumor immune response by: (1) expanding the number and function of existing CTLs that are specific to the same tumor antigen; and (2) providing help to other immune cells, including B lymphocytes that produce antibodies and natural killer cells that are also important in the overall anti-tumor immune response. We therefore believe that product candidates leveraging GLAAS with one or more tumor antigens will be effective in amplifying the anti-tumor activity of CTLs, as well as other beneficial anti-tumor mechanisms. In addition, we can leverage GLAAS to use a specific formulation of GLA alone without an antigen, as in the case of G100, for direct tumor microenvironment immune activation. Like ZVex, GLAAS product candidates have the potential to target multiple types of cancers.
The combination of ZVex and GLAAS in CMB305 is expected to synergize to yield a more potent immune response called a heterologous prime-boost. The ZVex vector primes the immune system by triggering the generation of CTLs, while the GLA-activated CD4 T cells boost the immune response by expanding and enhancing the function of CTLs and other anti-tumor immune mechanisms. We believe a more potent immune response should translate to clinical benefit for patients.
The following data from an in vivo rodent model illustrate the effect on antigen-specific CTL generation when combining the ZVex and GLAAS platforms in a prime-boost. When used alone, the ZVex agent increased the percentage of antigen-specific CTLs from 0.05% to 3.16%, and when used in combination with GLAAS, the percentage of antigen-specific CTLs in the rodents increased to 15.7%.
3

We are also studying a different combination of both platforms in a “prime-pull” strategy where a ZVex vector primes the immune system and G100 ‘pulls’ CTLs to the tumor via an effect of intratumoral injection. Further combination potential also exists with other immuno-oncology modalities, such as the use of G100 to “pull” engineered T cells to a tumor. We believe that these combinations of different technologies have the potential to be best-in-class approaches that generate and expand CTLs and recruit them to the tumor.
Our Approaches to Treating Cancer
Immuno-oncology broadly refers to the modulation of the immune system to eradicate tumor cells, and is often colloquially divided into two categories: “create and expand” the anti-tumor immune response and “remove the brakes” placed on the immune response by the tumor’s defenses.
We believe alteration of the tumor microenvironment and trafficking of CTLs into the tumor are increasingly being recognized as important for the efficacy of any immunotherapy. Our platforms focus on the “create and expand” category and are designed to generate strong, tumor-specific CTLs and effector cells in vivo while addressing many of the shortcomings of previous approaches. Our platforms can generate individual product candidates, such as G100, or complimentary product candidates administered in sequence, such as CMB305. Additionally, we designed our therapies to be combined with other immuno-oncology therapeutic mechanisms such as checkpoint inhibitors from the “remove the brakes” category, which we believe will generate a greater anti-tumor response.
Our immuno-oncology product candidates are being developed in two separate strategies that we designate as the Antigen Specific and Antigen Agnostic approaches.
Antigen Specific
Our Antigen Specific approach is based on the observation that human tumor cells make a variety of antigens that are not found in normal tissues, but are present in the patient’s tumor, so there is an opportunity to educate the immune system to recognize a pre-identified tumor antigen and kill tumor cells expressing it. ZVex products carry RNA of a chosen antigen or selected epitopes of multiple antigens, including neoantigens, whereas GLAAS products are accompanied by a full-length protein of the same antigen or, potentially, a peptide representing the selected epitopes. We have generated a significant amount of preclinical data illustrating the desirable qualities of this approach. The following graph illustrates the ability of ZVex in an in vivo rodent tumor model to generate an immune response against a protein the body recognizes as “self,” which it would therefore tolerate and not normally mount an immune response against. This experiment demonstrates the ability of ZVex to overcome immune tolerance, which is an important element of any potential cancer immunotherapy treatment.
4

For our first Antigen Specific product candidates, we have chosen a tumor-associated antigen named NY-ESO-1 that is expressed in a large number of solid and liquid tumors in varying degrees. We conducted an extensive search to choose NY-ESO-1, and we believe it is an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy due to its frequent expression in tumors, limited expression in normal tissue and its immunogenic potential. Among the antigens selected by the National Cancer Institute as the best targets for immunotherapy, only NY-ESO-1 and one other antigen have been shown to be tumor-specific. Our first two clinical programs targeting NY-ESO-1 from ZVex and GLAAS were LV305 and G305, respectively. LV305 delivers the RNA for NY-ESO-1, while G305 consists of a specific formulation of GLA and the full-length NY-ESO-1 protein. We administer LV305 and G305 in sequence to become CMB305, the heterologous prime-boost therapy. Although G305 may have the potential to be an effective therapy with patients who have insufficient immune responses prior to treatment, we do not intend to develop it as a stand-alone product and believe it is more effective as part of CMB305. Also, although we have seen initial clinical benefit from LV305 as a single agent in patients with soft tissue sarcoma, because we believe CMB305 should be more effective than LV305 alone, we intend to focus our development efforts on CMB305. We may, however, decide to develop LV305 as the data continue to develop. 
In December 2016, we announced ZVexMulti™, the evolution of the ZVex-platform designed to deliver multiple, full-length antigens and immunomodulatory molecules. ZVexMulti is engineered to avoid potential antigenic competition and enable the delivery of multiple RNA genes selectively to DCs to induce a simultaneous and balanced T cell response against all antigens. We believe this is a potentially significant advancement in our product development capabilities, enabling the development of therapies with the potential to target a wide range of conserved antigens and large number of neo-epitopes. With respect to neo-epitopes, we believe ZVexMulti will allow for the expression of a much larger number of epitopes than achievable with other platforms, obviating the need for a proprietary predictive algorithm to derive a limited set of epitopes.
We intend to designate the first product candidate from this enhanced platform in 2017.
Antigen Agnostic
Unlike the Antigen Specific approach, the Antigen Agnostic approach does not require pre-knowledge of a selected tumor antigen present in the cancer. It instead relies on endogenous conserved antigens or neoantigens released during tumor lysis by treatments such as chemotherapy or local radiation. G100, our lead product under this approach, is injected directly into the tumor, and neighboring GLA-activated DCs then capture the released antigens and generate a varied immune response. Because local radiation is an effective way to cause tumor cell lysis in accessible tumors, we plan initially to evaluate tumors that are accessible to both local radiation and intratumoral administration.
In collaboration with Dr. Ronald Levy’s lab at Stanford University, we examined the administration of intratumorally-injected G100 in the A20 murine model that is used to represent lymphoma. In an oral presentation at the 2015 American Society of Hematology, or ASH, annual meeting, Dr. Levy’s lab presented data showing tumor growth inhibition in both injected tumors as well as uninjected tumors, known as an abscopal effect. In addition, G100 had an impact on the tumor microenvironment, changing it from a non-inflammatory state, or “cold” tumor, to an inflamed state, or “hot” tumor. Specifically, as shown in the image below, responding animals remained tumor-free at least three months post G100 treatment and, without administration of additional G100, were resistant to secondary challenge with the same tumor type.
5

G100 is being evaluated in multiple clinical trials, including as a monotherapy with local radiation in a completed Phase 1 trial in patients with MCC and an ongoing investigator-sponsored trial at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in patients with sarcoma. At the ASCO annual meeting in 2016, we presented data on all 10 patients in the MCC trial, which showed: (1) an ORR of 50% per protocol; (2) a favorable safety profile with no treatment-related serious adverse events observed; and (3) that G100 significantly altered the tumor microenvironment in responding patients. Further, the 50% ORR included a pathologic complete response after two doses of G100 alone, and we reported two patients with durable partial responses, or PRs, of greater than 17 and 18 months. We plan to assess the potential impact on PFS and OS beyond the stated ORR. We are further evaluating G100 as a monotherapy with local radiation, and pursuant to a collaboration with Merck, we are enrolling a randomized Phase 2 trial in patients with follicular NHL that will evaluate G100 with local radiation and in combination with KEYTRUDA. The low incidence rates of NHL and MCC qualify each as an orphan disease, and we have received orphan drug designation in the United States for G100 for NHL.
In addition to G100, we are also investigating the potential use of our ZVex platform for intratumoral injection. For example, we presented preclinical data at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting in 2016 describing the intratumoral administration of a ZVex vector designed to generate localized expression of IL-12, a potent modulator of innate and adaptive immune responses. The results demonstrated strong local and systemic anti-tumor efficacy in multiple murine models, and this use of the ZVex platform offers a potential expansion opportunity of our Antigen Agnostic approach beyond G100.
Our Product Candidates in Development
Our clinical-stage oncology product candidates are depicted in the following diagram:

CMB305
We believe that prime-boost therapies are an optimal way to trigger a robust immune response. This is particularly true when distinct, but complementary, parts of the immune response are stimulated. Based on the predicted mechanisms of action in the prime-boost, our relevant preclinical studies and early CMB305 clinical data, we expect CMB305 to have synergistic effects and induce a stronger anti-tumor CTL response than either of its components alone. In addition to increasing the magnitude of the CTL response, we expect this approach to generate memory CTLs with long-term immune surveillance, as well as enhance other immune system anti-tumor mechanisms. Memory CTLs function as surveillance cells, ready to target persisting or new cancer cells with the same antigen signature, which may provide a longer-term benefit to patients.
We are testing CMB305 first in two types of sarcoma, called synovial sarcoma and myxoid round cell liposarcoma. Synovial sarcoma is a rare form of cancer in the joints. Certain studies of outcomes relating to synovial sarcoma have shown a five-year and ten-year survival for people with grade 3 tumors or metastatic disease of less than 25% and 15%, respectively. Myxoid round cell liposarcoma is a rare malignant tumor that most often occurs in the deep-seated soft tissues of the extremities. Approximately 50% of patients with synovial sarcoma and approximately 90% of patients with myxoid round cell liposarcoma express the NY-ESO-1 protein. The low incidence rates of these sarcomas qualifies each as an orphan disease, and we have received orphan drug designation for soft tissue sarcoma for CMB305 in the US and for both components of CMB305 in the US and EU. Orphan drug designation provides certain benefits, such as research tax credits and waivers of certain regulatory fees, but does not provide any assurance of regulatory approval or expedite regulatory review. However, these soft tissue sarcomas could be an ideal setting to show that CMB305 can provide clinical benefit to patients with an improved quality of life and, if the data are sufficiently robust and CMB305 is determined to be safe, this may provide an accelerated registration path. We believe that there is an opportunity to improve upon both the safety and clinical benefit profiles of approved chemotherapy agents in soft tissue sarcoma, which to date have demonstrated poor toxicity and produced limited impact on patient survival.
In separate Phase 1 trials presented at the ASCO annual meeting in 2015, each of CMB305’s components demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and, we believe, sufficient immunogenicity as individual agents. In addition, all of the patients in the LV305 dose-escalation study had types of soft tissue sarcoma, and we saw initial signs of clinical benefit. Because of these results and the supportive preclinical data, we are evaluating CMB305 in a Phase 1 monotherapy expansion trial and randomized Phase 2 trial. As announced in June 2016, data from an early subset of patients from the Phase 1 trial showed CMB305 as a single agent was without dose-limiting toxicities, as reviewed by an independent data safety monitoring board, or DSMB. CMB305 induced an antigen-specific T cell response in 50% of the patients, and patients who did respond immunologically had a greater degree of antigen-specific T cell response than that previously reported with LV305 alone, as well as a fully integrated response inducing antigen-specific CD4, CD8 and antibodies, both of which are consistent with the rationale of the prime-boost approach. We also observed initial data showing that the immune response induced in this approach may take time to emerge, as evidenced by the following CMB305 patient data revealing an integrated immune response (CD8s, CD4s and antibodies that were NY-ESO-1 specific) occurring over a period up to 112 days:
The time required to generate an immune response may be a contributing factor in the observation that cancer vaccines, although not likely to result in a significant ORR or PFS, may confer a better OS benefit than cytotoxic agents. Finally, preliminary clinical benefit in patients with soft tissue sarcoma was observed in the form of a 93% patient survival as of the June 2016 presentation data review date, and as of December 31, 2016, follow-up with 48 patients (CMB305; n=25 patients, and LV305; n=23 patients) revealed that the median OS has not been reached in either of the CMB305 or LV305 monotherapy studies. Chemotherapeutic agents approved to treat sarcoma have shown an OS of 12.4 to 13.5 months.
7

In addition to the ongoing Phase 1 trial evaluating CMB305 as a monotherapy, we have an ongoing randomized Phase 2 trial in patients with synovial or myxoid round cell liposarcoma. The patient’s cancer must be locally advanced, relapsed, or metastatic and express NY-ESO-1, and they must have had an inadequate response to, relapse from, and/or unacceptable toxicity with one or more prior systemic, surgical, or radiation cancer therapies. Pursuant to a collaboration with Genentech, these patients receive either CMB305 combined with Tecentriq, or Tecentriq alone. Clinical benefit will be evaluated by analyzing tumor responses and progression through short and long-term follow-up via clinical and radiological assessments.
We believe our “create and expand” immune response approach embodied in CMB305, either as a monotherapy or when combined with an agent such as Tecentriq that is designed to shut down certain tumor defenses, has potential to bring clinical benefit to patients and may qualify for an accelerated approval path, either via an expansion of the ongoing trials or the initiation of a new trial, if the clinical benefit data are sufficiently robust and CMB305 is determined to be safe. 
LV305 (the Prime in CMB305’s Prime Boost)
We have completed dosing in a Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety of escalating doses of single agent LV305 in patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic cancer expressing the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen. Although the trial was open to patients with multiple tumor types, all of the patients who enrolled had sarcoma. When available, we took post-treatment tumor biopsies to assist in clarifying the mechanisms that may mediate a treatment effect, such as the generation of NY-ESO-1 specific CTLs. Clinical benefit was evaluated by analyzing tumor responses and progression through short and long-term follow-up via clinical and radiological assessments. We also conducted an expansion trial of LV305 at the highest dose studied in the Phase 1 dose escalation trial. The expansion trial was open to patients with locally advanced, relapsed or metastatic melanoma, sarcoma, ovarian cancer or non-small cell lung cancer that express NY-ESO-1. 
At the ASCO meeting in 2016, we presented data on 24 patients from the LV305 Phase 1 trial with advanced or metastatic sarcoma cancers expressing NY-ESO-1. These patients had a median PFS of 4.6 months, and 58% of patients had clinical benefit in the form of stable disease and one patient showed a partial response, or PR. The safety profile remained very favorable with only grade 1 and 2 AEs. In addition, a median OS had not yet been reached, with 81% survival at one year. As set forth in the figures below, in accordance with gradual onset of immune response observed in the CMB305 patient data set forth above, the observed PR occurred at approximately 18 months and was accompanied by NY-ESO-1 specific T cell memory. We believe the nature of the mechanism of action taken with these combined data may be evidence that a ZVex product, although not likely to produce to a near-term ORR or PFS in sarcoma patients, may result in a clinical benefit over time.
As of December 31, 2016, this trial (n=23 soft tissue sarcoma patients) had not yet reached its median OS.
In all of these Antigen Specific trials, we will be collecting blood and tumor samples to measure CTL generation against NY-ESO-1 and to determine epitope mapping, antigen spreading and T cell receptor repertoire. If afforded the opportunity, we intend to present data for the ongoing CMB305 trials, as well as any follow-up data from the LV305 trials, at the ASCO annual meeting in 2017.

Antigen Agnostic
G100
We are evaluating our lead Antigen Agnostic approach product candidate, G100, in patients with NHL in an ongoing Phase 1b/2 trial examining G100 monotherapy with local radiation and in combination with KEYTRUDA, in the latter case pursuant to a collaboration with Merck. These patients must be either treatment naïve or relapsed or refractory following at least one prior treatment. We plan to inject a single tumor after the administration of local radiation and then evaluate the local immune environment and the potential clinical effect on distant tumors. If afforded the opportunity, we intend to present data from the Phase 1b monotherapy portion of the trial at the ASCO annual meeting in 2017, and the randomized, combination Phase 2 portion of the trial at a later medical meeting.
We completed a Phase 1 monotherapy trial with local radiation in patients with MCC, which is a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer associated with a polyomavirus infection and UV exposure. The majority of patients present with localized disease in the skin, although the disease can readily spread to regional and distant sites. The accessibility of most MCC tumors makes them excellent for intratumoral dosing and obtaining skin lesion biopsies to determine changes in the tumor microenvironment following G100 treatment. The trial was designed to evaluate safety and immunogenicity and provide preliminary indications of efficacy of G100 in MCC patients with either loco-regional or metastatic disease. At the ASCO annual meeting in 2016, we presented data on all 10 patients in the MCC trial showing: (1) an ORR of 50% per protocol; (2) a favorable safety profile; and (3) that G100 significantly altered the tumor microenvironment in responding patients. Further, the 50% ORR included a pathologic complete response after two doses of G100 alone, and we reported two patients with durable PRs of greater than 17 and 18 months. 
We have received orphan drug designation in the United States for G100 in patients with NHL. Orphan drug designation provides certain benefits, such as research tax credits and waivers of certain regulatory fees, but does not provide any assurance of regulatory approval or expedite regulatory review. As potential registration paths in NHL, we may decide to further pursue G100 as a monotherapy with local radiation and/or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors.
We are also evaluating G100 for the treatment of other types of tumors where preclinical data suggests there may be opportunities for the Antigen Agnostic approach, such as an ongoing an investigator-sponsored sarcoma clinical trial at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
Application of Our Platforms in the Immuno-Oncology Landscape
Mechanisms and Limitations of Immuno-Oncology Modalities
There are multiple in vivo and ex vivo approaches designed to “create and expand” the anti-tumor immune response and “remove the brakes” placed on the immune response by a tumor’s defenses.
Removing the Brakes: Checkpoint Inhibitors
Checkpoint inhibitors are designed to attack the defenses a tumor has against the immune system. We believe the efficacy of this approach depends on the existence of a CTL response against the tumor once those defenses are removed. Some patients’ immune systems do not recognize the tumor and therefore do not generate CTLs necessary to kill the tumor. If cancer immunotherapy is to become a therapy of choice, we believe each patient will need a strong engine to generate tumor-specific CTLs and the ability to neutralize or overcome any suppressive mechanism that a tumor may create to fend off the CTLs.
Creating and Expanding an Immune Response: Ex Vivo Modalities
Engineered CD8 T Cells - In these approaches, naïve resting CD8 T lymphocytes are isolated from the blood of cancer patients, manipulated in the laboratory and infused back into the patient. These approaches have produced potent anti-tumor responses, but are hampered by the risk of severe toxicity, limited scope of antigen recognition and cumbersome ex vivo procedures.
Dendritic Cell Vaccines - This ex vivo group of approaches involves isolating DCs from the blood of cancer patients, activating them in the laboratory and administering them to the patient with the hope that the DCs will trigger an immune response against tumor cells. Although this approach has resulted in one FDA approved product, its manufacturing and handling are cumbersome.
9

Creating and Expanding an Immune Response: In Vivo Modalities
Protein Vaccines - Many historical protein vaccine approaches rely on injecting either full-length or fragments of a tumor antigen protein into a cancer patient. These methods have often elicited an insufficient immune response. Full-length proteins are preferable to fragments, but full-length proteins may also require a second agent, called an immune adjuvant, to elicit a sufficient immune response. Adjuvants are designed to generate a better immune response but are historically non-specific and only marginally immunogenic. Importantly, this approach triggers an immune response characterized by antigen-specific antibodies and CD4 T cells, but not CTLs that are essential for killing cancer cells.
Oncolytic Viruses - Oncolytic viruses are rapidly and aggressively replicating viruses that, when injected intratumorally in accessible tumors such as melanoma skin lesions, preferentially lyse tumor cells instead of normal host cells. This lysis releases endogenous tumor antigens from the dying tumor cells, which may activate surrounding DCs that absorb the released antigens and trigger a broad immune response against a large number of tumor antigens. This approach holds promise but based on clinical trials conducted by third parties, may require combination with another modality to reach appropriate efficacy.
Delivery of Genomic Tumor Antigens - We believe delivering tumor antigens in their genomic form via viral vectors is the best way to generate CTLs if the DC can capture the vector and process the genomic information efficiently. The evolving neoantigen field could benefit from this form of delivery if the epitopes of interest are transported by a vector appropriately designed to trigger a maximum CTL response. However, vectors used to date have had significant limitations:

• | some of these vectors are replicative, meaning that they act like a live virus that infects a large variety of non-DC cells, causing disease;


• | patients with previous exposure to the virus from which the vector was derived may have neutralizing antibodies; and


• | none of these vectors were designed to selectively target and work effectively inside of DCs.

ZVex is designed to overcome these limitations of other viral vectors, while taking advantage of the superior CTL-generating property of this approach.
Modifying the Tumor Microenvironment. Histologically, tumors can be distinguished in those which have no, or only low, pre-existing infiltration of immune cells, so-called “cold” tumors, from those with high infiltration, or “hot” tumors. We believe that preclinical and clinical studies using various immuno-oncology approaches such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and/or passively transferred T cells have shown that hot tumors respond generally better to therapy. We believe the reason is that an ongoing local immune response in the tumor leads to antigen presentation, induction of immune responses and attraction of CD8 T cells into the tumor bed due to the production of certain soluble mediators known as chemokines. A principle aim of immuno-oncology should therefore be to modulate the tumor microenvironment, or TME, induce inflammation and render cold tumors hot. This can be achieved by direct intratumoral injection of agents that stimulate the innate immune response, such as agonists of toll-like receptors that are present on immune cells, such as TLR4. G100 is a potent stimulator of TLR4 and, further supported by topline data we disclosed in February 2016 that G100 significantly altered the TME in responding MCC patients, we believe it is ideally poised to induce beneficial changes in the TME.
The Immune Design Difference
We believe there has been a shift in the immuno-oncology paradigm due to a better understanding of why previous immunotherapy approaches have failed to trigger an effective anti-tumor immune response. We have focused on designing and developing cutting-edge discovery platforms and product strategies for effective cancer immunotherapies that take into consideration the limitations of other approaches.
Our novel in vivo cancer immunotherapies are designed for superior generation and expansion of CTLs to kill tumors. We believe a robust set of CTLs may, by itself or in combination with other therapies, lead to a meaningful clinical benefit for cancer patients. In the development of our discovery platforms and product candidates, we have considered not only historical weaknesses in different modalities, but also areas for improvement in light of more recent therapeutic approaches.
The Difference in Discovery
ZVex is a vector system partially derived from a lentivirus that is used to transfer the genetic information of foreign antigens to DCs in vivo in order to induce a tumor antigen-specific CTL response. ZVex has a variety of features to increase its safety and efficacy. We believe ZVex is superior to other lentiviral approaches and previous efforts attempting to deliver foreign genetic information to generate an immune response for the following reasons:
10


• | Selectivity for dendritic cells, by design. DCs are the best immune cells to generate the maximum CTL response when loaded with a foreign antigen. Lentiviruses, the backbone of ZVex, are known to be highly functional in DCs. We have engineered selectivity into our vector by coating the lentiviral particle with an envelope of another virus called Sindbis. Sindbis is naturally selective for a receptor only found on DCs, called DC-SIGN. As a result, our vectors will only bind to DCs, significantly reducing the risk of interacting with non-DCs. We believe that vectors being used by others in clinical trials lack this selectivity.


• | Capacity for substantial genetic payload. Our ZVex vector contains sufficient space for multiple antigens or selected epitopes of neoantigens. With the advancement of ZVexMulti, our ZVex-based therapies should provide for the concomitant expression of two or more tumor antigens, neoantigen epitopes, or of a tumor antigen and an immune stimulatory molecule such as a single-chain checkpoint inhibitor antibody.


• | No prior immunity to ZVex. Because of the rarity of the Sindbis virus, humans in developed countries should have a low prevalence of immunity against it. This lack of pre-existing immunity allows for multiple administrations of ZVex products, increasing the likelihood of a greater therapeutic benefit. This addresses one of the problems observed with other vectors, where a high level of antibodies against such vectors exist broadly in the population.


• | Integration deficiency. Lentiviruses are known for their natural capability to integrate within the genome of their host cell, notably DCs. However, we have engineered the vector to make it integration-deficient and thereby safer for patients. By making changes in the molecular sequence of the lentiviral vector, including the deletion of more HIV-specific sequences from its genome than comparable lentiviral vectors and making functional changes in the enzyme that carries out integration, the capacity of the vector to integrate its genetic material into that of the host cell is reduced approximately 1,000-fold from that of lentiviruses that are currently being used in the clinic. To our knowledge, the ZVex platform is the only integration-deficient lentiviral vector platform being developed for oncology indications.


• | Platform to generate product candidates for multiple indications. Each ZVex vector combined with the genetic payload of choice results in a distinct product candidate that can target different diseases. Although we are leveraging NY-ESO-1 as our initial tumor antigen, subsequent product candidates may contain the RNA for one or more antigens, neoantigen epitopes and checkpoint inhibitors. We believe these future product candidates would target a completely different set of tumors.


• | Potential for multiple vector platforms. ZVex is designed to deliver its payload to a specific type of DC. However, we can alter the cells targeted by our vectors to enable interaction with cells other than just DCs by using alternative envelopes, creating the potential for platforms beyond ZVex.

We have generated a significant amount of in vitro and in vivo preclinical data to support ZVex, including (1) generation of up to 15% of all CD8s specific to the desired antigen, which is up to several-fold higher than observed with many other vector systems, (2) establishment of a strong dose-CTL-response correlation in tumor models as evidence of our mechanism of action, (3) the ability to dose repeatedly, resulting in boosting of CD8 T cells and increased efficacy, (4) the ability to break immune tolerance, an important component of immuno-oncology, and (5) with ZVexMulti, the ability to deliver multiple RNA genes selectively to DCs to induce a simultaneous and balanced T cell response against all antigens. In addition, clinical data released from both the LV305 and CMB305 monotherapy trials show a consistently favorable safety profile and immune response rate, as well as an improved clinical benefit profile in the form of an emerging OS signal.
GLAAS is based on a fully synthetic molecule similar to lipid A, called GLA, which is short for glucopyranosyl lipid A. Lipid A is a natural substance that occurs in the cell wall of certain bacteria and has strong immune-stimulating properties because of its interaction with TLR4. DCs are the most potent antigen-presenting cells and have TLR4 receptors on their surface, the activation of which has several important aspects:

• | a strong immune response whereby DCs are activated and can express antigens, as well as secrete a number of inflammatory cytokines that lead to the activation of immune cells, in particular naive CD4 and CD8 T cells;


• | overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by activating DCs, T cells and natural killer cells;


• | when accompanied by an antigen in protein form, generation of a strong, antigen-specific adaptive immune response characterized by Th 1-type CD4 T cells; and


• | reversal of an allergic immune response to a state of attenuated immune reactivity towards the allergen.

11

We own or control rights to multiple formulations of GLA. In addition, in December 2015, we obtained certain rights, including in all oncology indications, to another synthetic TLR4 agonist referred to as SLA. The combination of a selected antigen with a formulation of choice makes GLAAS a potentially broad platform for a wide range of therapeutic applications.
The Difference of Our Immuno-Oncology Product Candidates
We have designed our product candidates to be different from current and traditional immuno-oncology products in the following ways:
Focus on CTLs - Earlier therapeutic efforts to generate an immune response against a tumor antigen either did not directly focus on CTL generation or used sub-optimal mechanisms. We are focused on directly generating a robust initial CTL population as well as memory CTLs, which are important for long-term immune surveillance. If CTL generation and expansion can be complemented by other mechanisms, such as the induction of CD4 T cells as part of the same immune response against the tumor, we expect the specific CTL response to be more robust.
Select and Administer Tumor Antigens Effectively - An increasing number of tumor antigens have been identified in recent years, and some have been validated as targets for active immunotherapy by balancing their expression in tumor cells versus healthy tissues. In addition, the emerging neoantigen field is expected to investigate the potential of patient-specific epitopes to generate an immune response either alone in or combination with conserved antigens. If the goal of the therapy is to generate the maximum CTL response, the antigen(s) or epitopes should be delivered in the form of DNA or RNA exclusively to DCs so the DC can express the full-length protein and present the peptide fragments to CD8 T lymphocytes. However, if CD4 T cell and antibody production is the goal, delivering an already expressed protein should be effective. Moreover, complementing the administered protein antigen with a molecular adjuvant such as the TLR4 agonist in GLAAS should enhance its immunogenicity.
Administer the Therapy In Vivo - We believe a product that can be used safely when delivered in vivo via simple injection will be preferable to the cumbersome processes involved with ex vivo manipulation of immune cells. Moreover, all ex vivo approaches are highly customized to each patient, whereas in vivo approaches with conserved antigens (either alone or with immune-stimulatory molecules) can be applicable to a large number of patients.
Implement a Prime-Boost Strategy - While a CTL-generating product can be sufficient alone, combining it with other immune drivers using a heterologous prime-boost can enhance CTL generation and trigger other mechanisms to augment the immune response. Heterologous prime-boost regimens have to date been mainly explored in the field of HIV vaccines, where they were shown to increase and broaden both T cell and antibody responses. We have evidence from several preclinical experiments that the administration of an antigen-specific ZVex vector when followed by, or in some cases preceded by, administration of the same recombinant protein with GLAAS, results in dramatically enhanced CD8 T cell responses. In addition, in February 2016, we disclosed that data from a completed first-in-human dose-escalation study and from a subset of patients in the expansion study of CMB305 showed that patients who did respond immunologically had a greater degree of antigen-specific T cell response than that previously reported in the Phase 1 study of LV305 alone, which is consistent with the rationale of the prime-boost approach.
Leverage Combination Therapies - It is our view that the future of immuno-oncology treatment is combination therapy, and we have designed our approaches to potentially combine with each other and multiple other external immuno-oncology mechanisms. Based on clinical trials in limited tumor types conducted to date, we believe that many, if not most, patients are immunologically tolerant to the tumor and lack an immune response. Therefore, these patients will receive little or no clinical benefit from checkpoint inhibitors unless a strong immune response is triggered. We therefore believe the combination of a CTL-generating approach with a checkpoint inhibitor is likely to provide significant therapeutic benefit.
Cause Antigen Spreading - Tumor destruction mediated by a strong CTL response against one tumor antigen can release other antigens present in the tumor cell. DCs then consume these new antigens, leading to additional immune responses. We believe a GLAAS product candidate will boost this second wave of CTLs generated against multiple distinct tumor antigens not present in the initial therapy, thereby enhancing the breadth of the immune response. This process is termed “antigen spreading” and is associated with increased efficacy of the immunotherapy. We anticipate potential antigen spreading to occur in both our heterologous prime-boost and Intratumoral Immune Activation approaches in patients.
Therapeutic Applications Outside Oncology
Although immuno-oncology development is robust with therapies for an estimated 10 liquid and 18 solid tumors in development and with a market for immuno-oncology therapies projected to approach $35 billion by 2023, the broader market for immunotherapy applications also includes infectious and allergic diseases. The worldwide infectious diseases vaccine market garnered approximately $30 billion in sales in 2014 and the market for allergy therapies and diagnostics is projected to 
12

reach $41 billion by 2022. Beyond oncology, we believe our technologies offer several promising applications in the fields of infectious and allergic diseases. We have been executing on our strategy to partner the use of our GLAAS platform in individual indications outside of oncology in infectious and allergic diseases, which provide potential downstream revenue while preserving growth opportunity in the future. 
Infectious Diseases
Historically, antigens have been used with sub-optimal immune adjuvants and have mainly focused on generating antibodies, which have been limited by low affinity and a narrow spectrum of activity. We believe using GLA, a novel molecular adjuvant, combined with infectious disease antigens will boost pre-existing T cells and trigger a broad antibody response, allowing for diverse antigen recognition. To date, GLA has been studied in human clinical trials involving over 1,400 subjects. The results of these trials that we have reviewed to date support the finding of increased magnitude and breadth of the antibody response.
We have a preclinical vaccine product candidate called G103 to treat herpes simplex virus type 2, or HSV2. G103 consists of several recombinantly expressed proteins adjuvanted with a specific formulation of GLA. In October 2014, we announced a collaboration with Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines division of Sanofi, to develop G103 along with additional assets contributed by us and Sanofi Pasteur. In addition to the G103 program, we have granted licenses under the GLAAS platform to partners developing a range of infectious disease vaccines, including licenses to MedImmune LLC in the field of respiratory syncytial virus and in a second, undisclosed indication. 
Allergic Diseases
We believe allergic diseases represent an exciting area for the application of GLAAS. Allergies to pollen or food often occur because of aberrant immune reactions, which are characterized by helper T cells producing signals that induce other immune cells to cause the allergy symptoms. We have a large set of preclinical data demonstrating that certain formulations of GLAAS, when given prophylactically or therapeutically with or without the allergen, can shift the responses in a way that results in significant protection from allergy symptoms. In essence, the immune system can be taught to redirect the T cells to respond in better ways. In August 2014, we announced a licensing agreement with Sanofi pursuant to which we granted Sanofi the right to use the GLAAS platform to develop therapeutic agents to treat peanut allergies. Sanofi is conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial under this agreement applying our GLAAS platform with its novel therapeutic candidate. 
The Potential for a Broad Footprint in Immuno-Oncology
We believe that cancer patients soon will be stratified pre-immune therapy into those with low or no CTL responses against their tumor versus those with good CTL responses. It is anticipated that many patients will fall into the first category, especially those with genetically stable, and hence less immunogenic, tumors. Because we believe our technologies should be broadly applicable across tumor types, patients in the larger group needing a CTL response would be candidates for immunotherapy with either ZVex- and/or GLAAS-based products.
The patients without a strong, pre-existing CTL response is also not expected to benefit from checkpoint inhibitors alone. We believe our technologies have the potential to convert this group into a robust CTL response-type group and enable them to respond to checkpoint inhibitors.
In addition, there may also be an opportunity to combine our approaches with other immuno-oncology mechanisms, such as engineered T cells, to extend the duration of the T cell response or “pull” T cells to the tumor.

Manufacturing
Overview
We are continuing to establish manufacturing processes and supply agreements for all of the components used in our product candidates to support ongoing and planned clinical trials. These include the components for LV305, bulk and formulated GLA for CMB305 and G100 and the NY-ESO-1 protein antigen for G305. We rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce our product candidates for clinical use and currently do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and all other applicable laws and regulations. We may continue to rely on CMOs to develop and manufacture our products for commercial sale. We maintain agreements with our CMOs that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates.
ZVex Product Candidates
We have contracts with third-party manufacturers to produce the vector, final drug product and fill-finish for LV305. Release and stability testing is done through a combination of in-house testing and contractual agreements with our CMOs. 
GLAAS Product Candidates
Manufacturing for the GLAAS platform generally encompasses the synthesis of bulk GLA, its formulations and the fill-finish of formulated GLA. We have established a supply chain for bulk GLA and two types of formulated GLA: stable emulsion, also called GLA-SE, and aqueous formulation, also called GLA-AF.
Our synthetic process for the manufacture of bulk GLA is a trade secret, and we retain control and ownership of this process. Our CMOs also perform release and stability testing on the bulk GLA. The scale of the GLA synthetic manufacturing process is adequate to support commercial production for our product candidates.
We have also contracted with a CMO to formulate and fill-finish our GLA-SE drug product. We have manufactured multiple lots in support of Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. The formulation process utilizes technology that is readily scalable to support commercial manufacturing of our product candidates and to supply our licensees. Release and stability testing on the GLA-SE drug product is contracted to several CMOs.
Intellectual Property
Overview
Our intellectual property strategy is to protect our technologies by filing multiple patent applications and obtaining patent rights both in the United States and in foreign countries that we consider important to our current and future business. In addition, we have acquired and will seek to acquire, as needed or desired, intellectual property rights of others through assignment or license to complement and enhance our portfolio of patent rights. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovations to develop and maintain our competitive position.

Licensing Agreements
We have in-licensed intellectual property related to our discovery platform technologies, including the following:
Exclusive License Agreement with Caltech
In January 2009, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Caltech, pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, exclusive license under certain patent rights directed to the production of dendritic cell-targeted therapeutic and prophylactic immunization strategies, with the right to sublicense. In September 2008, we exercised an option to expand the field of use to include human cancer applications. Additionally, we have a non-exclusive, sub-licensable worldwide license to unpatented know-how related to the licensed patents. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use diligent commercial efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products and to make them available to the developing world.
In partial consideration for the patent rights licensed to us under the license agreement, we issued shares of our common stock to Caltech. We are obligated to pay Caltech a low single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of licensed products, subject to a non-material annual minimum, as well as a mid single-digit to low double-digit percentage share of any payments that we receive from sub-licensees, which percentage depends on the stage of development when the sublicense was granted. We are also obligated to pay Caltech up to an aggregate of $1.6 million in additional payments based on the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Our royalty obligations continue for the life of the relevant licensed patent rights. Currently, we expect that the last-to-expire licensed patent in the United States will expire in 2027.
Our license agreement with Caltech will remain in effect until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent rights or the end of our payment obligations under the license agreement. Either party may terminate the license agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach or certain insolvency events.
15

Exclusive License Agreement with UNC Chapel Hill
In January 2013, we entered into a license agreement with UNC Chapel Hill, pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, sub-licensable, non-exclusive license to certain modified retroviral vectors, including a license under all patent rights owned or controlled by UNC Chapel Hill covering such vectors. In January 2015, we exercised an option to obtain an exclusive license under these patent rights. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently pursue the development and commercialization of licensed products, and we are required to meet certain performance milestones relating to the development of licensed products.
We will owe UNC Chapel Hill one or more non-material milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the development or regulatory approval of licensed products. We are also obligated to pay UNC Chapel Hill non-material annual renewal fees, a low double-digit percentage share of any payments that we receive from sub-licensees, and a low single-digit royalty on net sales of licensed products by us or our sub-licensees. Our royalty obligations continue for the life of the licensed patent rights, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, and in any event will cease upon termination or expiration of the license agreement. Currently, we expect that the last-to-expire licensed patent in the United States will expire in 2028.
Our license agreement with UNC Chapel Hill will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent rights, or, if no patents issue from the licensed patent rights, in January 2028. We may terminate the license agreement at any time upon advance written notice to UNC Chapel Hill. UNC Chapel Hill may terminate the license agreement in the event of our uncured material breach or if we become insolvent, and either party may terminate the license agreement for uncured fraud, willful misconduct, or illegal conduct of the other party.
License Agreement with TheraVectys SA
In October 2016, we entered into a license agreement with TheraVectys SA, or TVS, pursuant to which we received a field limited, non-exclusive, sublicensable license for oncology uses to certain current and future intellectual property rights owned, controlled and licensed by TVS relating to lentiviral vector technologies. The license agreement was entered into simultaneously with a settlement agreement resolving litigation brought by TVS against us related to our use of a third party contract manufacturing organization, Henogen, for the manufacture of our LV305 product candidate. TVS alleged that its contractual relationship with Henogen contained an exclusivity provision limiting Henogen’s ability to participate in the manufacturing process of a vaccine based on lentiviral DNA Flap vectors for third parties, as well as a provision preventing Henogen from sharing or using certain TVS confidential technology for manufacturing processes. We resolved the TVS allegations pursuant to the settlement agreement, and we additionally received certain present and future intellectual property rights under the license agreement, including, among other things, a sublicense to certain patent rights licensed by TVS from the Institut Pasteur.
We will owe TVS milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones for each licensed product, in the aggregate amount of up to $5.75 million, except that the first two milestones payments are waved for CMB305/LV305. In addition, we will be obligated to pay a single commercial milestone payment for each product that achieves a specified net sales amount. We will owe royalties to TVS on product sales that are made directly by us or our affiliates, subject to certain royalty-offset provisions. For the first four products, including LV305/CMB305, royalties will be based on a low-single digit percentage of net sales, and for subsequent products, tiered royalties will be based on low-to-mid-single digit percentages of net sales. TVS will also receive a mid-single digit percentage of revenues that we receive for sublicensing the licensed intellectual property.
The term of the license agreement expires upon the last to expire valid patent claim that is licensed to us. The license agreement may also be terminated by either party for customary reasons, such as an uncured material breach by the other party, or the other party’s insolvency. We may terminate the license agreement upon thirty days’ prior written notice to TVS.
Second Amended and Restated License Agreement with the Infectious Disease Research Institute
In December 2015, we entered into a second amended and restated license agreement with IDRI, pursuant to which we license certain patent rights, know-how and technologies relating to our GLAAS discovery platform, including products and formulations containing GLA and another synthetic TLR4 agonist referred to as SLA. The original license agreement with IDRI was entered into in July 2008, and the first restated agreement was entered into with IDRI in November 2010. We also entered into a separate agreement with IDRI in November 2015 to license a related patent in the field of cancer. The patent rights licensed from IDRI are directed to GLA and SLA, compositions and formulations that include these molecules, and methods of using these compositions to elicit or enhance an immune response. The licensed patent rights cover all of our GLAAS platform products in clinical development. Under the license agreement, we generally obtained an exclusive license in the fields of oncology, allergy, addiction and select infectious disease indications, which vary depending on the licensed GLA or SLA 
16

product. In addition, we have an option to obtain additional exclusive licenses in select infectious disease indications for GLA and SLA products. IDRI has retained exclusive rights with respect to infectious diseases and other indications not licensed to us. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products to which we have exclusive rights. We and IDRI are not permitted to sell or transfer GLA or SLA outside our respective exclusive fields.
For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we have paid IDRI $925,000, $2.9 million and $500,000 in upfront and annual fees, milestone fees, sublicensing fees and financial support of continuing research on GLA to IDRI, and issued shares of our common stock to IDRI. We are obligated to pay IDRI in aggregate up to $2.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in additional payments for the first and each subsequent exclusive licensed product we develop and $1.3 million and $625,000, respectively, for the first and each subsequent non-exclusive licensed product we develop based on the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones. We are obligated to pay IDRI a low single-digit royalty on net sales of licensed products that varies according to the product and indication, as well as a percentage share of any payments that we receive from sub-licensees, ranging from the low double-digits to the middle single-digits. Our royalty obligations continue for the life of the relevant licensed patents or 12 years after the first commercial sale of a licensed product, whichever is longer. Currently, we expect that the last-to-expire licensed patent in the United States will expire in 2028 with respect to GLA products and 2032 with respect to SLA products.
Our license agreement with IDRI will remain in effect until the expiration of our payment obligations under the license agreement. We may terminate the license agreement at any time with advance written notice. IDRI may terminate the license agreement if we challenge any of the licensed patents. Either party may terminate the license agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or upon certain insolvency events.
License and Collaboration Agreements
Exclusive License Agreements with MedImmune
We are parties to two separate license agreements with MedImmune LLC, or MedImmune, each dated October 2010, pursuant to which we granted MedImmune a worldwide, sub-licensable, exclusive license use GLA to develop and sell vaccines in two different infectious disease indications. Under the license agreements, MedImmune is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for a licensed product in certain markets and to market and sell licensed products in any country where it obtains regulatory approval.
Under each license agreement, depending on the infectious disease indication, if certain development regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved, MedImmune is obligated to make additional aggregate payments of $62.9 million to $72.5 million. We recognized zero, $2.5 million, $1.0 million in revenue for the achievement of development milestones under these license agreements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. MedImmune is also obligated to pay us a low double-digit percentage share of non-royalty payments that it receives from sub-licensees and a mid single-digit royalty on net sales of licensed products, which royalty is subject to reduction under certain circumstances. Under our license agreement with IDRI, we are obligated to share with IDRI a percentage of payments received from third-party licensees, including MedImmune. MedImmune’s royalty obligations will continue, on a country-by-country basis, for at least 10 years after the first commercial sale of the first licensed product in the applicable country and will continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, for the life of the licensed patents that cover the sale of the applicable product in the applicable country.
Each of our license agreements with MedImmune will remain in effect until the later of October 2060 or the expiration of MedImmune’s payment obligations. MedImmune may terminate any of the license agreements at any time with advance written notice. We or MedImmune may terminate any of the license agreements in case of the other party’s uncured material breach or upon certain insolvency events.
Exclusive License Agreement with Sanofi
In August 2014, we granted Sanofi an exclusive license to use the GLAAS platform to discover, develop and commercialize products to treat peanut allergy. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $7.0 million, $1.0 million, and $3.5 million in revenue, respectively, and as of December 31, 2016 we are eligible to receive additional development and commercialization milestones totaling US $160.0 million, as well as tiered royalties on sales of approved products. In September 2016, Sanofi paid us $7.0 million in milestone revenue upon initiating a Phase 1 clinical trial with its novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of peanut allergy and using our GLAAS platform under this license agreement.
17

Collaboration Agreement with Sanofi Pasteur
In October 2014, we entered into a collaboration for the development of a herpes simplex virus, or HSV, immune therapy with Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines division of Sanofi. We and Sanofi Pasteur are each contributing product candidates to the collaboration: Sanofi Pasteur is contributing HSV-529, a clinical-stage, replication-defective HSV vaccine product candidate, and we contribute G103, our preclinical trivalent vaccine product candidate. The collaboration will explore the potential of various combinations of agents, including leveraging our GLAAS platform, with the goal to select the best potential immune therapy for patients. We will develop the products jointly through Phase 2 clinical trials, at which point Sanofi Pasteur intends to continue development of the most promising candidate and be responsible for commercialization. Sanofi Pasteur will bear the costs of all preclinical and clinical development, and we will provide a specific formulation of GLA from the GLAAS platform at our cost through Phase 2 studies. We are eligible to receive future milestone and royalty payments on any licensed product developed from the collaboration.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by continuing technological advancement and significant competition. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge and experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our product candidates. The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our product candidates. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
In the United States, the FDA regulates our current product candidates as biological drug products, or biologics, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and related regulations. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial actions. These actions could include the suspension or termination of clinical trials by the FDA or an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, revocation of a biologics license, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, import detention, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any administrative or judicial action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of biologics. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, purity, potency, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping and reporting, approval, import and export, advertising and promotion and post-market surveillance of our products.
The FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of any future product candidates or approval of product or manufacturing changes, new disease indications, or label changes. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.

Biologics Marketing Approval
The process required by the FDA before biologics may be marketed in the United States generally involves nonclinical laboratory and animal tests; submission of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic for its intended use or uses; pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites; and FDA approval of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, which must occur before a biologic can be marketed or sold.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Our planned clinical trials for our product candidates may not begin or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:

• | obtaining regulatory approval to commence a study;


• | reaching agreement with third-party clinical trial sites and their subsequent performance in conducting accurate and reliable studies on a timely basis;


• | obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a study at a prospective site; and


• | recruiting patients to participate in a study; and


• | supply of the investigational product and related materials.

Before testing any compound in human subjects, a company must develop extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. Animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act and related regulations.
Prior to commencing the first clinical trial in humans, an initial IND application must be submitted to the FDA. A company must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND, and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such case, the IND application sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during product development. Further, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol and informed consent for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. Informed consent must also be obtained from each study subject. Regulatory authorities, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
A study sponsor is also required to submit to NIH for public posting on NIH’s clinical trial website, details about certain active clinical trials and clinical trial results. For purposes of developing product candidates for BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in phases that may overlap:

• | Phase 1—the investigational biologic is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, reactivity, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. These studies may also gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational products may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.


• | Phase 2—studies are conducted in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to assess the efficacy of the investigational product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.


• | Phase 3—when Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the investigational product may be effective and may have an acceptable safety profile, and provide sufficient information for the design of Phase 3 clinical trials, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage,

19

effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval by the FDA.
All of these trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes.
Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or any other regulatory agency will grant approvals for any future product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. Success in early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.
The Biologic License Application Approval Process
In order to obtain approval to market a biologic in the United States, a BLA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product for the proposed indication. Each BLA submission requires a substantial user fee payment unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators.
The FDA will initially review the BLA for completeness before it accepts it for filing. Under the FDA’s procedures, the agency has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, which includes determining whether it is effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP, to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure that the benefits of the biologic outweighs the risks. A REMS may include various elements depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug. These elements may range from a medication guide or patient package insert to training and certification requirements for prescribers and/or pharmacies to safe use conditions that must be in place before the drug is dispersed. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the BLA sponsor must submit a proposed REMS and the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS that the agency has determined is acceptable.
Certain applications for approval must include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug or biological product in relevant pediatric populations. The FDA may waive or defer the requirement for a pediatric assessment, either at the Company’s request or by the agency’s initiative.
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs and biological products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug or biologic is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to the product for that use. The benefits of orphan drug designation include research and development tax credits and exemption from user fees. A drug or biologic that is approved for the orphan designated indication is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity.
For investigational products that are intended to treat serious diseases, certain mechanisms may expedite the FDA approval process. For example, FDA may grant Priority Review designation for a product that could provide significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. Priority Review sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months from the FDA’s filing of the BLA, rather than the standard 10 months. Priority review designation does not, however, change the scientific or medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. Another potential approach is Fast Track designation, which a sponsor can request at any time during the development process to facilitate development and expedite review of a product intended to treat a serious condition and fill an unmet medical need. Fast Track designation involves early and frequent communication between the FDA and the sponsor, 
20

which often leads to earlier approval. Breakthrough Therapy designation is another approach that is intended to expedite development and review of a product that is intended to treat a serious condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. Like Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation provides a sponsor with the opportunity to obtain early and intensive guidance from FDA for an efficient drug development program.
After the FDA completes its initial review of a BLA, it will either communicate to the sponsor that it will approve the product, or issue a complete response letter to communicate that it will not approve the BLA in its current form and to inform the sponsor of changes that the sponsor must make or additional clinical, nonclinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the FDA can approve the application, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application. If a complete response letter is issued, the sponsor may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP, the FDA may determine that the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from analyses provided in the BLA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
The testing and approval process for a biologic requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and this process may take several years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 clinical trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing product approval. The results of Phase 4 clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. Conversely, the results of Phase 4 clinical trials can raise new safety or efficacy issues that were not apparent during the original review of the product, which may result in product restrictions or even withdrawal of the product approval. In addition, the FDA has express statutory authority to require sponsors to conduct post-market studies or clinical trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency.
Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval will be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and/or dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of a REMs, restrictions on distribution, or post-marketing study or trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product requirements to conduct additional studies or trials, or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future United States or foreign governmental action.
FDA Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us or on our behalf pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements for record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences with the biologic, submitting annual reports, and reporting biological product deviations. Manufacturers are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP standards, which impose certain quality processes, manufacturing controls and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers in order to ensure that the product is safe, has the identity and strength, and meets the quality, purity and potency characteristics that it purports to have. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, refuse to approve any BLA or other application, force us to recall a drug from distribution, shut down manufacturing operations or withdraw approval of the BLA for that biologic. Noncompliance with cGMP or other requirements can result in issuance of warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures, and injunctive action.
21

The FDA and other federal and state agencies closely regulate the labeling, marketing and promotion of biologics. While doctors may prescribe any product approved by the FDA for any use as long as consistent with any REMS restrictions, if applicable, a company can only make claims about a product that are consistent with its FDA approval, and the Company is allowed to market a drug only for the particular use approved by the FDA. In addition, any claims we make for our products in advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, untitled or warning letters, corrective advertising requirements, injunctions, potential civil and criminal penalties, criminal prosecution, and agreements with governmental agencies that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. Government regulators, including the Department of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, as well as state authorities, recently have increased their scrutiny of the promotion and marketing of drugs.
Finally, post-approval modifications to a licensed biological product, such as changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical or clinical trials, to be submitted in a new or supplemental BLA, which would require FDA review and approval.
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, amended the Public Health Service Act to create a licensure framework for biosimilar products, or biosimiliars, which could ultimately subject our biological product candidates to competition from biosimiliars. Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an abbreviated application for licensure of a biologic that is “biosimilar to” an already licensed biologic, or reference product. This abbreviated approval pathway is intended to permit a biosimilar to come to market more quickly and less expensively, by relying to some extent on the FDA’s previous review and approval of the reference biologic to which the proposed product is biosimilar. 
Under the BPCIA, a biosimilar sponsor’s ability to seek or obtain approval through the abbreviated pathway is limited by periods of exclusivity granted to the sponsor of the reference product. No biosimilar application may be accepted by the FDA for review until four years after the date of approval of the reference product, and no such application, once accepted, may receive final approval until 12 years after that same date. Once approved, biosimilar products likely would compete with, and in some circumstances may be deemed under the law to be “interchangeable with”, the previously approved reference product.
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
As part of our clinical development plans, we are exploring the use of a companion diagnostic to identify patients most likely to respond to CMB305. Companion diagnostics are classified as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the United States. In the United States, the FDA regulates the medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, reporting, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion, export and import, sales and distribution, and post-market surveillance of medical devices. Unless an exemption applies, companion diagnostics require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA.
The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the cancer treatment to obtain a PMA simultaneously with approval of the drug. Based on the draft guidance, and the FDA’s past treatment of companion diagnostics, we believe that the FDA will require a PMA for one or more companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for CMB305. The review of these companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our product candidates involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
Coverage and Reimbursement
In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Such third-party payors include governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and managed care organizations and other entities. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is granted, the reimbursement rates paid for covered products might not be adequate. Even if favorable coverage status and adequate reimbursement rates are attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. The marketability of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if governmental healthcare programs and other third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement to allow us to sell such products on a competitive and profitable basis. For example, under these circumstances, 
22

physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer our product, and patients may decline to purchase such products. This, in turn, could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
The market for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on the degree to which these products are listed on third-party payors’ drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included on such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payor individually establishes coverage and reimbursement policies, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement can be a time-consuming and costly process. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval will be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results.
Other Healthcare Laws
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are subject to numerous regulations by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and its various divisions, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. These regulations are enforced by various federal, state and local authorities, including but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, state Medicaid Fraud Control Units, HHS’ various enforcement divisions, including but not limited to, the Office of Inspector General, the Office for Human Research Protections, or OHRP, and the Office of Research Integrity and other state and local government agencies. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
We are subject to complex laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and other state and federal laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and subsequent legislation, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions; however, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. Private “qui tam” actions may be brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced investigations and private lawsuits and, in many cases, have agreed to significant and burdensome settlements under these laws for a variety of allegedly improper promotional and marketing activities, including inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Federal False Claims Act violations may result in significant civil monetary penalties, including three times the damages incurred by the government from the violation. The majority of U.S. states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, 
23

which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, and in some states, apply regardless of the payor. The federal False Statements Statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, or knowingly and willfully making false statements relating to healthcare matters. The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain covered entity health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to track payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests, and to publicly report such data. Manufacturers subject to the Open Payments Program must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year. Failure to comply with the reporting obligations may result in civil monetary penalties.
Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, some states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes and have privacy laws that may be more stringent that HIPAA. 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal or state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant criminal and civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
The Affordable Care Act
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, even if they are approved for sale. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical and medical device industries have been a particular focus of these efforts and have been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change health care delivery and financing by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries are the following:

• | The Affordable Care Act increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program from 15.1% to 23.1% and from 11% to 13% of the average manufacturer price, or AMP, for most

24

branded and generic drugs and biologic agents, respectively. The Affordable Care Act also added a rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products and potentially impacted manufacturers’ Medicaid Drug Rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The Affordable Care Act also expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid program from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. 

• | On February 1, 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that administers the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. 


• | Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. 


• | The Affordable Care Act imposes a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic agents to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”) as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.


• | The Affordable Care Act imposes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications. The Affordable Care Act expanded healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, and added new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance.


• | The Affordable Care Act established the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (as referenced above), which requires pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers to track and report annually certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, including reporting any “payments or other transfers of value” made or distributed to such entities, and it requires applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and certain other healthcare providers and their immediate family members by the 90th day of each calendar year.


• | The Affordable Care Act added a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians.


• | New Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to the Affordable Care Act to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.


• | The Affordable Care Act created the Independent Payment Advisory Board which, if and when empaneled, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings.


• | The Affordable Care Act established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.

Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to numerous aspects of the Affordable Care Act. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Resolution is not a law; however, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of repeal legislation. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of

pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the Affordable Care Act that are repealed.
The U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions that are expected to impact our business and operations, in some cases in ways we cannot currently predict. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products and impact our financial condition and results of operations.
Other Legislative Changes and Regulations
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
