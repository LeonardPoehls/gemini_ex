  OVERVIEW

 The Company organizes its business units into three reportable segments: Broker-Dealer Services, Holding Company and Natural Resource. The Broker-Dealer Services segment distributes securities and insurance products to retail investors through a network of registered representatives. The Natural Resource segment sought opportunities in petroleum and natural gas exploration and production, however in the fourth quarter of 2016 the Company determined to dispose of its natural resource assets in order to concentrate on its core business of Broker-Dealer Services.

The Company’s principal offices are located at 1 Main Street North, Minot, North Dakota 58703. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had 21 full-time employees consisting of officers, principals, data processing, compliance, accounting, and clerical support staff.
  
  BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
  
 On March 7, 2007, the Company acquired certain assets of United Heritage Financial Services, Inc. (UHFS), a wholly owned subsidiary of United Heritage Financial Group, Inc., of Meridian, Idaho. UHFS had approximately 120 independent registered representatives who became part of Capital Financial Services, Inc. (CFS), the retail brokerage division of the Company. Pursuant to the agreement, in exchange for the assets of UHFS set forth above, the Company agreed to issue 50 restricted CFH shares and pay a deferred cash earn out payment totaling a maximum of $900,000, to be paid in 21 quarterly installments. On March 7, 2007, the Company issued 50 options to purchase shares of the Company to UHFS. As a result of this issuance of shares, $175,000 was recorded by the Company as goodwill relating to the purchase of the assets. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had made twenty-one quarterly installment payments. There is no longer a liability relating to this acquisition. Due to the goodwill impairment charge that was recorded for the periods ended December 31, 2010, March 31, 2012, and December 31, 2015, the total goodwill recorded relating to this acquisition was zero.
  
 On June 9, 2014, the Company launched a wholly owned operating subsidiary, Capital Natural Resources, Inc., a Colorado corporation. Capital Natural Resources, Inc. sought opportunities related to natural resources in the United States, including petroleum, natural gas, and/or other minerals, water resources and land. In the fourth quarter of 2016 the Company determined to dispose of its natural resource assets in order to concentrate on its core business of Broker-Dealer Services to enable a more efficient use of its personnel and financial resources. As of December 31, 2016 the segment met the definition of discontinued operations.

 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
  
  Brokerage Commissions
  
 CFS’s primary source of revenue is commission revenue in connection with sales of shares of mutual funds, insurance products, and various other securities. CFS receives commission and Rule 12b-1 servicing revenue generated from the sale of investment products originated by its registered representatives. CFS also receives investment advisory revenue as a registered investment advisor. CFS pays a portion of the revenue generated to its registered representatives and retains the balance. Commission income and the related clearing expenses are recorded based on the trade date. The revenue earned from 12b-1 is recognized ratably over the period received. Investment advisory fees are derived from account management and investment advisory services. These fees are determined based on a percentage of the customer’s assets under sponsor management or a flat fee, may be billed monthly or quarterly and recognized ratably over the period received. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  REGULATION
  
 Virtually all aspects of the Company’s businesses are subject to various complex and extensive federal and state laws and regulations. Regulated areas include, but are not limited to, the effecting of securities transactions, the financial condition of the Company’s subsidiaries, record-keeping and reporting procedures, relationships with clients, and experience and training requirements for certain employees. The Company’s subsidiary, Capital Financial Services, Inc. (“CFS”), is registered with various federal and state government agencies, including the SEC, as well as FINRA, a self-regulatory industry organization, as described below.
  
 CFS is a registered broker-dealer subject to extensive regulation and periodic examinations by the SEC, FINRA, and state agencies in those states in which CFS conducts business. As a broker-dealer, CFS is subject to the Net Capital Rule promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). This rule requires that a broker-dealer must maintain certain minimum net capital and that its aggregate indebtedness may not exceed specified limitations.
  
 Federal and state laws and regulations, and the rules of FINRA, grant broad powers to such regulatory agencies and organizations. These include the power to limit, restrict, or prevent the Company from carrying on its business if it fails to comply with such laws, regulations and rules. Other possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, restrictions on the Company expanding its business or paying cash dividends, the revocation of the investment advisor or broker dealer expulsions, censures, and/or fines.
  
 The Company operates under the provision of Paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, accordingly, is exempt from the remaining provisions of that rule. To the best of its knowledge the Company met the identified exemption provisions from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 without exception.
  
 Since 1993, FINRA rules have limited the amount of aggregate sales charges which may be paid in connection with the purchase and holding of investment company shares sold through broker-dealers. Congress and the SEC presently are considering amendments to Rule 12b-1 and other statutory provisions and rules that regulate the distribution of mutual fund shares. The effect of the rule amendments and other legislative or regulatory actions might be to limit the amount of fees that could be paid pursuant to a fund’s 12b-1 Plan in a situation where a fund has no, or limited, new sales for a prolonged period of time, as well as the imposition of other limits on the use of fund assets to pay for distribution.
  
  COMPETITION
  
 The Company derives substantially all of its revenues from commission revenue earned in connection with sales of shares of mutual funds, insurance products and various other securities, and also receives investment advisory revenue.
  
 The Company participates in retail brokerage, a highly competitive related sector of the financial services industry. The Company competes directly with full-service stock brokerage firms, insurance companies, banks, regional broker-dealers, other independent broker-dealers, and other financial institutions, as well as investment advisory firms. Each of these competitors offer to the public many of the same investment products and services offered by the Company. Further, other broker-dealers providing the same services heavily recruit the representatives and advisors transacting business through the Company. This competition forces the Company to maintain high levels of support services and commission payouts for these representatives and advisors. These high levels of services and payouts could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s earnings.
  
  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
  
 In the fourth quarter of 2016 the Company determined to dispose of its natural resource segment in order to concentrate on its core business of Broker-Dealer Services to enable a more efficient use of its personnel and financial resources. As of December 31, 2016 the segment met the definition of discontinued operations.The sale was completed on March 3, 2017 for cash of $66,200. Impairment on its oil and gas properties was recorded based upon the actual value of the assets as determined by sale of the assets in open unreserved auction through an independent nationally recognized oil and gas property auction facility as of December 31, 2016.
