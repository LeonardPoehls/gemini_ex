 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  Business Overview
  
  Petro River Oil Corp. (the “Company”) is an independent energy company focused on the exploration and development of conventional oil and gas assets with low discovery and development costs, utilizing modern technology. The Company is currently focused on moving forward with drilling wells on several of its properties owned directly and indirectly through its interest in Horizon Energy Partners, LLC (“Horizon Energy”), as well as entering highly prospective plays with Horizon Energy and other industry-leading partners. Diversification over a number of projects, each with low initial capital expenditures and strong risk reward characteristics, reduces risk and provides cross-functional exposure to a number of attractive risk adjusted opportunities.
  
  The Company’s core holdings are in the Mid-Continent Region in Oklahoma, including in Osage County and Kay County, Oklahoma. Following the acquisition of Horizon I Investments, LLC (“Horizon Investments”), the Company has additional exposure to a portfolio of domestic and international oil and gas assets consisting of highly prospective conventional plays diversified across project type, geographic location and risk profile, as well as access to a broad network of industry leaders from Horizon Investment’s interest in Horizon Energy. Horizon Energy is an oil and gas exploration and development company owned and managed by former senior oil and gas executives. It has a portfolio of domestic and international assets. Each of the assets in the Horizon Energy portfolio is characterized by low initial capital expenditure requirements and strong risk reward characteristics.
  
  The Company’s prospects in Oklahoma are owned directly by the Company and indirectly through Spyglass Energy Group, LLC (“Spyglass”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bandolier Energy, LLC (“Bandolier”). As a result of the Exchange Transaction consummated on January 31, 2018, as discussed below, Bandolier is wholly-owned by the Company. Bandolier has a 75% working interest in the 87,754-acre concession in Osage County, Oklahoma. The remaining 25% working interest is held by the operator, Performance Energy, LLC.
  
  The execution of our business plan is dependent on obtaining necessary working capital. While no assurances can be given, in the event management is able to obtain additional working capital, we plan to continue drilling additional wells on our existing concessions, and to acquire additional high-quality oil and gas properties, primarily proved producing, and proved undeveloped reserves. We also intend to explore low-risk development drilling and work-over opportunities. Management is also exploring farm-in and joint venture opportunities for our oil and gas assets.
  
  Recent Developments
  
  Recent Oil Discoveries.
  
  On July 24, 2018, the Company announced the discovery of its largest oil field to date with the Company’s successful drilling of the Arsaga 25-2 exploration well, located on its concession in Osage County, Oklahoma. The well was spud on July 9, 2018, and was drilled to a depth of approximately 2,750 feet. Preliminary results indicate 30 feet of productive Mississippian Chat formation. The Arsaga Field spans approximately 2,000 acres, with up to 100 well locations.
  
  On May 22, 2018, the Company announced the discovery of a new oil field, the N. Blackland Field, in its concession in Osage County, Oklahoma upon successfully testing of the 2-34 exploration well (the “2-34”). The 2-34 was drilled to a depth of approximately 2,850 feet, and initial results indicate both Mississippian Chat and Burges formations were discovered and have been comingled to increase production rates. The N. Blackland Field is approximately 200 acres, and the Company expects to drill an additional eight to ten wells to develop the structure. This structure was identified using 3-D seismic technology. This development project is anticipated to result in production revenue prior to the end of the current fiscal year.
  
  In May 2017, Bandolier discovered two new oil fields with the successful drilling of the W. Blackland 1-3 and S. Blackland 2-11 exploration wells. On December 15, 2017, the Company received permits from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to drill eight additional wells in the W. Blackland Field, which were successfully completed in April 2018. The Company has received additional permits, and is currently in the process of drilling an additional two wells. Our W. Blackland concessions are currently producing, and, with the drilling of additional wells, we anticipate substantially increasing revenue throughout the remainder of the current fiscal year.

  In addition to our current development plans, within our current 3-D seismic data, additional structures in Osage County have been identified. The Company plans to drill 13 additional wells in calendar year 2018: nine in the N. Blackland Field, three in the Arsaga structure and one in the Section 13 structure. The Company anticipates drilling these wells out of cash flows from current production of its existing wells.
  
  Working Interest Exchange.
  
  On February 14, 2018, the Company entered into a Purchase and Exchange Agreement with Red Fork Resources (“Red Fork”), pursuant to which (i) the Company agreed to convey to Mountain View Resources, LLC, an affiliate of Red Fork, 100% of its 13.7% working interest in and to an area of mutual interest (“AMI”) in the Mountain View Project in Kern County, California, and (ii) Red Fork agreed to convey to the Company 64.7% of its 85% working interest in and to an AMI situated in Kay County, Oklahoma (the “Red Fork Exchange”). The fair value of the assets acquired was $108,333 as of the date of the agreement. Following the Red Fork Exchange, the Company and Red Fork each retained a 2% overriding royalty interest in the projects that they respectively conveyed. Under the terms of the Agreement, all revenues and costs, expenses, obligations and liabilities earned or incurred prior to January 1, 2018 (the “Effective Date”) shall be borne by the original owners of such working interests, and all of such costs, expenses, obligations and liabilities that occur subsequent to the Effective Date shall be borne by the new owners of such working interests.
  
  The acquisition of the additional concessions in Kay County, Oklahoma added additional prospect locations adjacent to the Company’s 87,754-acre concession in Osage County, Oklahoma. The similarity of the prospects in Kay and Kern County allows for the leverage of assets, infrastructure and technical expertise.
  
  MegaWest Exchange Transaction.
  
  On January 31, 2018, the Company entered into an Assignment and Assumption of Membership Interest with MegaWest Energy Kansas Corp. (“MegaWest”) (the “Assignment Agreement”), whereby the Company transferred its interest in MegaWest in exchange for a 50% membership interest in Bandolier Energy LLC (“Bandolier”) (the “Bandolier Interest”) then held by MegaWest (the “Exchange Transaction”), as a result of the Bandolier Acquisition, as defined below. The Exchange Transaction followed the receipt by the Company of a notice of Redetermination, as defined below, of MegaWest’s assets, including MegaWest’s interest in the Bandolier Interests (together, “MegaWest Assets”), conducted by Fortis Property Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Fortis”).
  
  The Redetermination was conducted pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, pursuant to which the Board of MegaWest was entitled to engage a qualified appraiser to determine the value of the MegaWest Assets and Bandolier Interests, and upon the completion thereof (a “Redetermination”), in the event the MegaWest Assets were determined to be less than $40.0 million, then a Shortfall, as defined in the Contribution Agreement, exists. As a result, the Company would be required to make cash contributions to MegaWest in an amount equal to the amount of the Shortfall (the “Shortfall Capital Contribution”). The Contribution Agreement further provided that, in the event that the Company was unable to deliver to MegaWest the Shortfall Capital Contribution required after the Redetermination, if any, MegaWest would have the right to exercise certain remedies, including a right to foreclose on the Company’s entire interest in MegaWest. In the event of foreclosure, the Bandolier Interest would revert back to the Company. 
  
  In lieu of engaging a qualified appraiser to quantify the Shortfall Capital Contribution, and in lieu of requiring MegaWest to exercise its remedies under the terms of the Contribution Agreement, the Company and MegaWest entered into the Exchange Transaction. As a result, the Company has no further rights or interest in MegaWest, and MegaWest has no further rights or interest in any assets associated with the Bandolier Interests. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement and Assignment Agreement, the Company continues to be responsible for a reimbursement payment to MegaWest in the amount of $259,313, together with interest accrued thereon at an annual rate 10%, which will be due and payable one year after the date of the Assignment Agreement and has been included as a payable since January 31, 2018. As a result of the Redetermination, the Company recorded a loss on redetermination of $11,914,204 reflecting the write-off of the related assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests of Fortis.

  At the time the parties entered into the Contribution Agreement, management anticipated that the market price for crude oil would return to prices reached prior to 2015, and that additional wells would be drilled, resulting in greater revenue from the Bandolier Interests. Subsequent to the execution of the Contribution Agreement, only two wells had been drilled as of January 2018. That fact, together with the relatively low price of crude oil and the anticipated delays in drilling additional wells to demonstrate the value of the Bandolier Interests, contributed to Fortis’ election to terminate the Contribution Agreement at the end of its term, as amended. Had the market price of oil supported the value of developing the Bandolier oil and gas properties at that time, under the terms of the Contribution Agreement, Fortis would have been required to fund the planned drilling program.
  
  Recent Financings.
  
  On September 20, 2017, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Petro Exploration Funding II, LLC (“Funding Corp. II”), pursuant to which the Company issued to Funding Corp. II a senior secured promissory note on November 6, 2017 in the principal amount of $2.5 million (the “November 2017 Secured Note”) (the “November 2017 Note Financing”) and received total proceeds of $2.5 million. As additional consideration for the purchase of the November 2017 Secured Note, the Company issued to Funding Corp. II (i) a warrant to purchase 1.25 million shares of the Company’s common stock, and (ii) an overriding royalty interest equal to 2% in all production from the Company’s interest in the Company’s concessions located in Osage County, Oklahoma currently held by Spyglass (the “Existing Osage County Override”). The Existing Osage County Override was an existing override that was acquired by the Company from Scot Cohen. The note accrues interest at a rate of 10% per annum and matures on June 30, 2020.
  
  Scott Cohen, a member of the Company’s Board of Directors and a substantial stockholder of the Company, owns or controls 31.25% of Funding Corp. I and 41.20% of Funding Corp. II.
  
  On June 13, 2017, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Petro Exploration Funding, LLC (“Funding Corp. I”), pursuant to which the Company issued to Funding Corp. I a senior secured promissory note to finance the Company’s working capital requirements (the “June Note Financing”), in the principal amount of $2.0 million. As additional consideration for the June Note Financing, the Company issued to Funding Corp. I (i) a warrant to purchase 840,336 shares of the Company’s common stock, and (ii) an overriding royalty interest equal to 2% in all production from the Company’s interest in the Company’s concessions located in Osage County, Oklahoma, currently held by Spyglass, pursuant to an Assignment of Overriding Royalty Interests. The note accrues interest at a rate of 10% per annum and matures on June 30, 2020.
  
 Scot Cohen owns or controls 31.25% of Funding Corp. I.
  
  On June 18, 2018, Bandolier Energy, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Loan Agreement with Scot Cohen, the Executive Chairman of the Company (the “Cohen Loan Agreement”), pursuant to which Scot Cohen loaned the Company $300,000 at a 10% annual interest rate due September 30, 2018. The Cohen Loan Agreement was to provide the Company with short term financing in connection with the Company’s drilling program in Osage County, Oklahoma.  
  
  Acquisition of Membership Interest in the Osage County Concession.
  
  On November 6, 2017, the Company entered into an Assignment and Assumption of Membership Interest Agreement (the “Membership Interest Assignment”) with Pearsonia West Investments, LLC (“Pearsonia”). Pursuant to the Membership Interest Assignment, the Company issued 1,466,667 shares of its common stock, with a fair value of $1.75 per share, to Pearsonia in exchange for all the membership interests in Bandolier held by Pearsonia. As result of this transaction, the Company wrote-off the non-controlling interest in Bandolier totaling $785,298 and recorded a loss of $3,351,965.
 Our Objective
  
 Our primary objective is to enhance shareholder value by increasing our net asset value, net reserves and cash flow through development, exploitation, exploration, and acquisition of oil and gas properties.
 Our Strategy
  
 We intend to follow a balanced risk strategy by allocating capital expenditures to a combination of lower risk development and high potential exploration prospects. Key elements of our business strategy include the following:
  
  Develop and exploit our existing oil and natural gas properties. Our principal growth strategy has been to explore, develop and exploit our acquired and leased properties to add proven reserves.
  
   
-4-



 
 
  Pursue selective acquisitions. The Company has acquired leasehold positions that it believes contain substantial resource potential and meet its targeted returns on invested capital. Management intends to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that meet the Company’s operational and financial targets. We seek to acquire developed and undeveloped oil and gas properties that will provide us with additional development and exploratory prospect opportunities. We may also acquire a working interest in one or more prospects from others and participate with the other working interest owners in drilling and, if warranted, completing oil or gas wells on a prospect. We may purchase producing oil or gas properties.
  
  Use the latest 3-D seismic technology to maximize returns. Technical advances in imaging and modeling can lower risk and enhance productivity. The Company intends to utilize 3-D seismic and other technological advancements that benefit its exploratory and developmental drilling program.
  
  Plan of Operation
  
 The Company is currently engaged in oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration, development and production, with activities principally in Oklahoma in the United States, and Northern Ireland, Denmark and the U.K. in Western Europe. We focus on developing our existing properties, while continuing to pursue acquisitions of oil and gas properties with upside potential.
  
 The Company intends to grow its resources and production through exploration activities and development of identified potential drilling locations, and through acquisitions that meet the Company’s strategic and financial objectives. Our plan includes:
  
  Leveraging our management experience. The Company’s executive team, along with Horizon Energy, the Company’s operating partner, has extensive and proven experience in the oil and gas industry. We believe that the experience of our executive team will help reduce the time and cost associated with drilling and completing exploration and development of our conventional assets and potentially increasing recovery. Collectively, our management team and engineering professionals identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities, negotiate and close purchases and manage acquired properties.
  
  Leveraging our established business relationships. Our executive team, along with Horizon Energy, has many relationships with operators and service providers in our core asset regions. We believe that leveraging our relationships will provide us with a competitive advantage in developing our acreage and identifying acquisition targets.
  
  De-risking our acreage position and build a vertical drilling program. The Company has identified a multi-year inventory of potential drilling locations that will drive reserves and production growth and provide attractive return opportunities. The Company views its Osage County, Kay County and Horizon Energy projects as de-risked because of the significant production history in the areas and well-established industry activity surrounding the acreage.
  
  Partnership with Horizon Energy. Following the acquisition of Horizon Investments, the Company has an indirect interest, through Horizon Investment’s 20% ownership in Horizon Energy, in a portfolio of several domestic and international oil and gas assets consisting of highly prospective conventional plays diversified across project type, geographic location and risk profile, as well as access to a broad network of industry leaders.
  
  Competitive Strengths
  
  Financial flexibility. Our capital structure and high degree of operational control continue to provide us with significant financial flexibility. Other than recent financings with related parties as discussed above, we have no corporate debt in our capital structure, enabling us to make capital decisions with no restrictions imposed by debt covenants, lender oversight and/or mandatory repayment schedules. Additionally, in concert with our partner, Horizon Energy, we control the majority of our anticipated future net drilling locations, including the timing and selection of drilling locations as well as completion schedules. This allows us to modify our capital spending program depending on financial resources, leasehold requirements and market conditions.
  
   
-5-



 
 
  Management experience. Our key management team possesses an average of over thirty years of experience in oil and gas exploration and production in multiple resource plays, including exploration and production in the Company’s core regions of Osage, Oklahoma, Kay County, Oklahoma, and the North Sea.
  
  Cost-efficient operators. In the past, our management team has shown an ability to drill wells in a cost-efficient way and to successfully integrate acquired assets without incurring significant increases in overhead.
  
  History
  
 The Company was originally incorporated under the Company Act (British Columbia) on February 8, 2000 under the name Brockton Capital Corp. We then changed our name to MegaWest Energy Corp. effective February 27, 2010, before changing it to Gravis Oil Corp. on June 20, 2011. On September 11, 2012, we re-organized under the laws of the State of Delaware as a corporation organized under the Delaware General Corporation Law. Prior to September 11, 2012, and at April 30, 2012, we were organized under the laws of Alberta, Canada.
  
 Petro River Oil LLC (“Petro”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, and wholly owned subsidiary of MegaWest, was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 3, 2011. Through proceeds received from the issuance of various promissory notes, on February 1, 2012, Petro purchased various interests in oil and gas leases, wells, records, data and related personal property located along the play in the state of Kansas (“Mississippi Assets”).  Effective December 23, 2015, Petro divested the Mississippi Assets. In connection with the divestiture, the assignee and purchaser of the Mississippi Assets agreed to pay outstanding liabilities, including unpaid taxes, and assume certain responsibilities to plug any abandoned wells. No cash consideration was paid for the interests.
  
  Share Exchange.
  
 On April 23, 2013, the Company executed and consummated a securities purchase agreement by and among the Company, Petro, and certain investors in Petro (the “Investors”), namely, the holders of outstanding secured promissory notes of Petro (the “Notes”), and those holding membership interests in Petro (the “Membership Interests,” and, together with the Notes, the “Acquired Securities”) sold by Petro (the “Share Exchange”). In the Share Exchange, the Investors exchanged their Acquired Securities for 591,021,011 newly issued shares of the Company’s common stock (2,955,105 shares of common stock based on the December 2015 reverse stock split – see “Reverse Stock Split” below). Upon completion of the Share Exchange, Petro became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
  
 As a result of the Share Exchange, the Company acquired 100% of the membership units of Petro and consequently, control of Petro’s business and operations. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), because Petro’s former members and note holders held 80% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company as a result of the Share Exchange, Petro was deemed the accounting acquirer while the Company remains the legal acquirer. Petro adopted the fiscal year of the Company. Prior to the Share Exchange, all historical financial statements presented are those of Petro. The equity of the Company is the historical equity of Petro, restated to reflect the number of shares issued by the Company in the transaction.
  
  Acquisition of Interest in Bandolier Energy LLC.
 
 On May 30, 2014, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement pursuant to which the Company was issued a 50% interest in Bandolier in exchange for a capital contribution of $5.0 million (the “Bandolier Acquisition”). In connection with the Bandolier Acquisition, the Company had the right to appoint a majority of the board of managers of Bandolier. The Company’s Executive Chairman was a manager of, and owned a 20% membership interest in, Pearsonia West Investment Group, LLC (“Pearsonia West”), a special purpose vehicle formed for the purpose of investing in Bandolier with the Company and Ranger Station, LLC (“Ranger Station”). Concurrent with the Bandolier Acquisition, Pearsonia West was issued a 44% interest in Bandolier for cash consideration of $4.4 million, and Ranger Station was issued a 6% interest in Bandolier for cash consideration of $600,000. In connection with Pearsonia West’s investment in Bandolier, the Company and Pearsonia West entered into an agreement, dated May 30, 2014, granting the members of Pearsonia West an option, exercisable at any time prior to May 30, 2017, to exchange their pro rata share of the Bandolier membership interests for shares of the Company’s common stock, at a price of $0.08 per share, subject to adjustment (the “Option”). The Option, if fully exercised, would result in the Company issuing 55,000,000 shares of its common stock (275,000 shares of common stock at a price of $16 per share based on the December 2015 reverse stock split – see “Reverse Stock Split” below), or 6% to the members of Pearsonia West.

 Until the execution of the Contribution Agreement, described below, the Company had operational control along with a 50% ownership interest in Bandolier. As a result, the Company consolidated Bandolier. The remaining 50% non-controlling interest represented the equity investment from Pearsonia West and Ranger Station. The Company allocated the proportionate share of the net operating income/loss to both the Company and the non-controlling interest.
  
 Subsequent to the initial capitalization of Bandolier, Bandolier acquired, for $8,712,893 less a $407,161 claw back, all of the issued and outstanding equity of Spyglass, the owner of oil and gas leases, leaseholds, lands, and options and concessions thereto located in Osage County, Oklahoma. Spyglass controlled a significant contiguous oil and gas acreage position in Northeastern Oklahoma, consisting of 87,754 acres, with substantial original oil in place, stacked reservoirs, as well as exploratory and development opportunities that could be accessed through both horizontal and vertical drilling. Significant infrastructure was already in place including 32 square miles of 3-D seismic, 3 phase power, a dedicated sub-station as well as multiple oil producing horizontal wells.
  
 The Company recorded the purchase of Spyglass by Bandolier using the acquisition method of accounting as specified in ASC 805 “Business Combinations.” This method of accounting requires the acquirer to (i) record purchase consideration issued to sellers in a business combination at fair value on the date control is obtained, (ii) determine the fair value of any non-controlling interest, and (iii) allocate the purchase consideration to all tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their acquisition date fair values. Further, the Company commenced reporting the results of Spyglass on a consolidated basis with those of the Company effective upon the date of the acquisition. 
  
  Acquisition and Dilution of Horizon Investments. 
  
  On December 1, 2015, the Company entered into a conditional purchase agreement with Horizon Investments (as amended, the “Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company acquired, on May 3, 2016, (i) a 20% membership interest in Horizon Energy; (ii) three promissory notes issued by the Company to Horizon Investments in the aggregate principal amount of $1.6 million (the “Horizon Notes”); (iii) approximately $690,000 held in escrow pending closing under the Purchase Agreement (the “Closing Proceeds”); and (iv) certain bank, investment and other accounts maintained by Horizon Investments, in an amount which, together with the principal amount of the Horizon Note and the Closing Proceeds, totaled not less than $5.0 million (collectively, the “Purchased Assets”). The consideration for the Purchased Assets was 11,564,249 shares of the Company's common stock, $0.00001 par value (“Common Stock”), which shares were issued to Horizon Investments at closing.
  
 On February 2, 2018, Horizon Investments received from Horizon Energy a capital call in the amount of $600,227. Horizon Investments did not have the required funds to fund the capital call. The capital call was not mandatory and the consequence of Horizon Investments’ failure to fund the capital call was a dilution in Horizon Investments’ interest in Horizon Energy by 27.43%, therefore reducing Horizon Investments’ interest in Horizon Energy from 20.01% to 14.52%. Scot Cohen, a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, a substantial stockholder, and a member of Horizon Energy, participated with other Horizon Energy members to make the requested capital call in light of Horizon Investment’s inability to make the requested capital call. The determination not to make the requested capital call, and therefore allow Mr. Cohen to increase his membership interest in Horizon Energy, was discussed and approved by the independent members of the Company’s Board of Directors.
  
  Competition
  
  We operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies, many of whom have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us. These competitors may be better positioned to take advantage of industry opportunities and to withstand changes affecting the industry, such as fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and production, the availability of alternative energy sources and the application of government regulation.
  
   
-7-



 
 
  Compliance with Government Regulation
  
 The availability of a ready market for future oil and gas production from possible U.S. assets depends upon numerous factors beyond our control. These factors may include, amongst others, regulation of oil and natural gas production, regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control, and the effects of regulation on the amount of oil and natural gas available for sale, the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels. These regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of oil and natural gas and control contamination of the environment.
  
 We expect that our sales of crude oil and other hydrocarbon liquids from our future U.S.-based production will not be regulated and will be made at market prices. However, the price we would receive from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market via pipeline.
  
  Environmental Regulations
  
  Our U.S. assets are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities; limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations, such as pit closure and plugging abandoned wells; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from production and drilling operations. Public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The worldwide trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations applied to the oil and natural gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business and prospects could be adversely affected.
 Operating Hazards and Insurance
  
 The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating hazards and risks such as well blowouts, craterings, pipe failures, casing collapse, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, pipeline ruptures or spills, pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards and risks could result in substantial losses to us from, among other things, injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. 
  
 In accordance with customary industry practices, we expect to maintain insurance against some, but not all, of such risks and losses. There can be no assurance that any insurance we obtain would be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities. We cannot predict the continued availability of insurance or the availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations. 
  
 Pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition. If we were unable to obtain adequate insurance, we could be forced to participate in all of our activities on a non-operated basis, which would limit our ability to control the risks associated with oil and natural gas operations.
  
  Research and Development
  
  On December 12, 2013, we formed Petro Spring, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary (“Petro Spring”), to focus on technology solutions related to the oil and gas industry.  During the year ended April 30, 2015, Petro Spring I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company wholly owned by Petro Spring (“Petro Spring I”), entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement (“Havelide Purchase Agreement”) to purchase substantially all of the assets of Havelide GTL LLC (“Havelide”) and Coalthane Tech LLC (“Coalthane”), consisting of certain patents and other intellectual property, trade secrets, and assets developed and owned by Havelide to produce a gasoline-like liquid and high-purity hydrogen from natural gas, at low temperature and at low pressure (the “Havelide Assets”) and consisting of certain patents and other intellectual property, trade secrets, and assets developed and owned by Coalthane to reduce the methane from coal mines and other wells (the “Coalthane Assets”). The purchase of the Coalthane and Havelide Assets was consummated on February 27, 2015. The acquisitions reflected the Company’s desire to diversify the Company’s business amid the challenging oil price environment that existed at that time.

  As of April 30, 2016, the Company did not have adequate capital to fund additional development of the intangibles and, therefore, the Company has been unable to identify near-term opportunities to commercialize the technology. As of April 30, 2016, the Company performed an impairment assessment on the intangible assets and recognized an impairment charge of $2,082,941, and it does not intend to expend any additional amounts to develop the Havelide Assets or Coalthane Assets at this time.
  
  Employees
  
 At April 30, 2018, we employed four full-time employees and two part-time employees. We also retained several consultants to provide both operational, investor relations and marketing support.
  
  Geographical Area of the Company’s Business
  
 The principal market that we compete in is the North American and Western Europe. The Company is currently contemplating expansion into additional international energy markets.
