Item 1. | Business

Our Company
NxStage Medical, Inc. is a medical technology company that develops, manufactures and markets innovative products and services for patients suffering from chronic or acute kidney failure. We also operate a small number of NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers, independently and in some instances as joint ventures, that treat end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients directly. 
Our primary product, the System One, was designed to satisfy an unmet clinical need for a system capable of delivering the therapeutic flexibility and clinical benefits of traditional dialysis machines in a smaller, portable, easy-to-use form that can be used by healthcare professionals and trained lay users alike in a variety of settings, including patient homes, as well as more traditional care settings such as hospitals and dialysis centers. Given its design, the System One is particularly well-suited for home hemodialysis and a range of dialysis therapies that are more practical to deliver in the home setting, including more frequent hemodialysis and nocturnal hemodialysis. Clinical literature suggests that more frequent hemodialysis represents a clinically significant innovation in care delivery for patients with ESRD, and it has been reported to deliver important clinical benefits and improved quality of life for certain patients. In addition to the System One, we sell blood tubing sets and needles to dialysis clinics and hospitals for use with traditional dialysis machines.
We report our operating results through three segments: System One, In-Center and Services. We sell our products in and provide our services in three markets: home, critical care and in-center. Our other business activities excluded from segment operating performance measures relate primarily to the manufacturing of dialyzers for sale to Asahi. Together with certain research and development and general and administrative expenses that are excluded from our business segment operating results, these business activities are reported in the Other category. The operating results of our dialysis centers business, which we refer to as NxStage Kidney Care, are included in our Services segment. Sales of our System One and related products to our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers are included in System One segment home market revenues, which are then eliminated upon consolidation. For convenience, we use the term “products business” to refer collectively to our System One segment, In-Center segment, and Other category. 
We are headquartered in Lawrence, Massachusetts, with manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Germany and Italy. Through our international network of affiliates and distribution partners, patients in 21 countries have been treated with our products.
Proposed Merger
 On August 7, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. (Fresenius), pursuant to which we will merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fresenius, subject to certain conditions. At the closing of the Merger, all outstanding shares of our common stock (except those held by us, Fresenius or its wholly-owned subsidiaries or any stockholders properly exercising their appraisal rights under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) would be converted into the right to receive $30.00 per share in cash, subject to any applicable tax withholdings.
The closing of the Merger is conditioned, among other things, on receipt of regulatory approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the expiration or earlier termination of applicable waiting periods, or extensions thereof, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (HSR Act). Pursuant to the HSR Act, we and Fresenius each submitted pre-merger notification filings to the FTC and Department of Justice, Antitrust Division. On October 18, 2017, we and Fresenius each received a Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material (also known as a Second Request) from the FTC. The effect of the Second Request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the HSR Act until 30 days after Fresenius and we have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless that period is terminated sooner by the FTC. By agreement with the FTC, the parties may voluntarily extend the time for closing beyond the expiration of the HSR Act waiting period. The parties continue to work to obtain FTC approval of the proposed transaction. On October 27, 2017, the stockholders of NxStage Medical, Inc. voted to adopt the Merger Agreement. In addition, the Merger has cleared antitrust review in Germany and the UK. See “Risk Factors” in Part I Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.
The Merger Agreement may be terminated by us or Fresenius if the Merger is not closed by August 7, 2018 (End Date), although Fresenius may extend the End Date for up to 180 days under certain circumstances in order to obtain required antitrust clearances. The Merger Agreement generally requires each party to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents and clearances required under any antitrust law, except that Fresenius is not required (i) to litigate against a governmental entity or 
 6

(ii) to divest or to take any other actions with respect to any assets or business of Fresenius, its subsidiaries or the Company, other than, if necessary to obtain antitrust clearances, with respect to certain Company assets.
Fresenius is required to pay us a termination fee of $100 million (Reverse Termination Fee) if the Merger Agreement is terminated by us or Fresenius (i) if the End Date and any applicable extension has passed or (ii) if a court or other governmental entity issues a final, nonappealable order or takes any other actions that permanently prohibits the Merger or makes closing the Merger illegal (in each case because approval under applicable antitrust laws remains the only unsatisfied closing condition).
We would be required to pay Fresenius a termination fee of $60 million (Termination Fee) if all of the following conditions were applicable: (i) the Merger Agreement is terminated because the End Date has passed or we have breached a representation or warranty, (ii) an alternative acquisition proposal has been publicly made and not publicly withdrawn at least ten days prior to the termination, and (iii) within 12 months following such termination, we enter into an alternative acquisition agreement or an alternative acquisition is consummated. Nonetheless, we will not be required to pay the Termination Fee if the Merger Agreement is terminated due to failure to obtain required antitrust approvals by the End Date and Fresenius is required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee.
The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to operate our business in all material respects in the ordinary course until the closing of the Merger.

Since inception, we have focused on building a long-term sustainable business model based on innovative technologies and offerings. Although we have driven significant revenue growth, we have historically operated at a net loss. In recent years, we have started to achieve greater operating leverage and financial improvements, while maintaining our focus on product development and topline growth. During 2017, we continued to generate operating income in our products business, and we expect to continue our focus on driving improvements in 2018 and beyond within this business. In 2018, we expect the operating income we generate in our products business will continue to be more than offset by losses from our NxStage Kidney Care business as well as costs associated with working to close the proposed Merger with Fresenius. 
Our Market 
Kidney Failure: Chronic and Acute
Chronic kidney disease is typically characterized by the progressive loss of kidney function due to damage caused by diabetes, high blood pressure and other causes. The final stage of chronic kidney disease is called ESRD, which is an irreversible, life-threatening loss of kidney function that is treated predominantly with dialysis. Dialysis is a kidney replacement therapy that removes toxins and excess fluids from the bloodstream. Unless the patient receives a kidney transplant, dialysis is required for the remainder of the patient’s life. The primary types of dialysis are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis diverts the patient’s blood to an external dialyzer, where a filter and cleansing fluid (“dialysate”) remove toxins and excess fluids, and then returns the cleansed blood to the patient. Hemodialysis is traditionally 
 7

performed by healthcare professionals in a dialysis clinic on a fixed schedule three times per week, referred to as “in-center” treatment, but can be performed by a trained and qualified patient, with the availability of a care partner, or where appropriate without a care partner present, in the home three to seven times per week. Peritoneal dialysis is a home therapy in which toxins are removed through the peritoneum, a part of the patient’s abdomen, through multiple fluid exchanges each day. 
Acute kidney failure happens suddenly, as a result of illness, injury or other conditions. Acute kidney failure is typically treated with renal replacement therapies, including hemodialysis, in a hospital or similar critical care setting.
Approximately 495,000 ESRD patients in the U.S. and 2.6 million ESRD patients worldwide rely on life-sustaining dialysis treatment. 
Dialysis Modality Prevalence (U.S.)
Although in-center hemodialysis is the most common ESRD therapy in the U.S., surveys of healthcare professionals suggest that a larger proportion of patients could take responsibility for their own care. In fact, more than 90% of surveyed U.S. nephrologists have said they would choose a home dialysis therapy for themselves if informed they needed renal replacement therapy, with home hemodialysis being the preferred option. With our current technology, we believe that approximately 10-15% of ESRD patients in the U.S. would be appropriate candidates for home hemodialysis with the System One. 
Studies have consistently shown that home hemodialysis may be a viable alternative for ESRD patients to experience enhanced health, control and freedom. Home hemodialysis offers patients numerous benefits when compared with traditional in-center hemodialysis, including:
-    improved survival;

- | independence and the ability to better understand and take control of one’s care;


- | freedom from specific time constraints with greater ability to work and participate in “normal” life activities;


- | greater freedom to travel;


- | convenience of not driving to and from the dialysis center three times a week; and


- | privacy and comfort of being at home.

In addition, home hemodialysis presents the most practical setting for performing therapy at the frequency and duration that best suits a patient’s clinical needs. Traditional in-center hemodialysis treatment schedules are constrained by staffing and time slot availability, which presents practical and economic limitations on the ability to explore or implement innovative therapy delivery models that are more tailored to the unique clinical and lifestyle needs of patients, as well as responsive to the growing body of clinical literature reporting on the benefits of different therapy delivery models. Although the significant majority of ESRD patients are cared for in-center under a delivery model that provides for three treatments a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday, or Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday), typically at 3 to 4 hours per session, there is mounting clinical evidence demonstrating the quality of life and clinical benefits of alternative therapy delivery schedules, including additional dialysis sessions (from four to seven sessions per week) as well as longer, nocturnal therapy sessions. More frequent therapy, in particular, has been shown to lead to better clinical outcomes such as:
-    improved survival;

- | reduced risk of cardiovascular morbidity;


- | improved regulation of blood pressure and phosphorus and reduced need for related medications;


- | improved physical and mental quality of life; and


- | better therapy tolerance.

For more information about the clinical benefits of more frequent hemodialysis, please review the section below entitled “Clinical Evidence.”

Products Market
While we believe the significant majority of our near-term revenues will come from sales of the System One in the U.S., we see opportunities to grow our potential market opportunity both within the U.S. and internationally.
Grow Adoption of Home Hemodialysis with the System One
To increase patient awareness and demand for home and more frequent hemodialysis, we participate in preeminent nephrology conferences, organize educational programs for patients and clinicians in collaboration with local service providers, employ patient advocates and conduct numerous other educational and promotional activities.
We also advocate for increased access to the life changing benefits of home hemodialysis and more frequent hemodialysis for medically suitable patients. Even though healthcare professionals would choose home hemodialysis for themselves more than any other modality, many of their patients do not have adequate access to this option. According to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), only 18% of U.S. dialysis clinics actively offer home hemodialysis to their patients, and only 27% are certified to offer the therapy. Although access to home and more frequent hemodialysis continues to grow, we believe that current Medicare reimbursement policies lead to adoption rates lower than rates commensurate with the percentage of patients experts believe can perform and medically benefit from this therapy. We believe further improving Medicare reimbursement for home hemodialysis training, as well as more predictable Medicare reimbursement for more frequent dialysis with less administrative burden and payment for medical oversight equal to that provided for overseeing in-center patients would allow U.S. adoption of home hemodialysis at rates more consistent with what is deemed to be appropriate by the medical community. We continue to engage in regular dialogue with CMS, Medicare contractors, policymakers and industry experts on such issues to encourage broader adoption of home and more frequent hemodialysis. 
Drive Global Expansion
Historically, predominantly all of our revenues have come from sales of our products in the U.S. However, the U.S. represents a small portion of the global market for ESRD products. Accordingly, international expansion represents a significant growth opportunity.
We commenced international sales in 2009 and have sold the System One in 21 countries. We seek to increase our product revenues by expanding our international presence within countries where we have an established footprint and entering new regions through third-party distributors who have an established presence in such regions. Furthermore, our product development activities focused on the treatment of acute kidney disease are expected to introduce features and enhancements that we believe will increase the appeal of our products to international customers.
Enhance the Clinical Flexibility and Ease of Use of our Product Offering
We promote our products’ clinical flexibility and ease of use. Accordingly, we continue to expand the System One's indications and add new features and tools to enhance usability and reduce the burden of therapy. Since receiving its first clearance for home hemodialysis from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005, and the first and only home nocturnal hemodialysis clearance in 2014, the System One has provided over 14 million treatments to thousands of patients in their homes around the world, during the day and at night.  However, certain patients have not had access to the option of performing hemodialysis at home because the System One's indication has required that a care partner be present when a patient performs home hemodialysis. In August of 2017, the System One was cleared in the U.S. for solo home hemodialysis, without a care partner, during waking hours. We believe this new expanded indication will provide both new and existing System One patients, trained to perform solo home hemodialysis, the freedom to dialyze at home without a care partner during waking hours, provided that the patient and physician agree that solo home hemodialysis is appropriate.

We have also seen strong interest in Nx2me Connected Health, our telehealth platform for the collection and delivery of treatment and medical information for patients using the System One. By enhancing the ease of information collection and availability to the patient and care team, Nx2me may foster improved home patient retention and communication. 
In addition, our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers have gained valuable clinical insights that will help us to optimize our product technology. 
Expand into Skilled Nursing Facilities
We focus on expanding into skilled nursing facilities where we believe our product technology offers a differentiated and compelling value proposition. 
Nursing home residents represent approximately 8% of all ESRD patients. Nursing home patients are generally transported off-site to dialysis clinics, which may introduce several risks to their health and compromise their care. The System One can be used at skilled nursing facilities to offer residents on-site home hemodialysis, which may eliminate patient discomfort from traveling to an outside facility and the accompanying disruptions in rehabilitation, medication schedules and social activities. Offering on-site hemodialysis also eliminates the high costs of transporting patients to dialysis clinics, which is not always covered by reimbursement.
New Product Development
We have over a decade long history of technology innovation. Our product development organization is working to develop innovative technical approaches that address the limitations of current dialysis systems and disposable products. These efforts are primarily focused in the System One segment where we have established a sales presence. Consistent with this, we continue to develop our home hemodialysis system, the System One and, among others, our Nx2me platform. We are developing a new critical care cycler that is intended to expand the range of therapies that can presently be performed by the System One to include, for example, hemodiafiltration, which is used more extensively outside of the U.S. We are also continuing our work to develop a peritoneal dialysis system to offer a differentiated therapy solution with on-site dialysate generation from concentrate without the need for premixed bagged fluids, with pre-connected, ready to use disposables that require fewer touch contamination points, and automation to improve setup, training and use.
We are in the early stages of launching our next generation home hemodialysis system with a touch screen interface and continue to develop enhanced capabilities for this system through software and hardware development. As a part of this next generation home hemodialysis system, we have been developing a new dialysate preparation system which provides bicarbonate based dialysate on-line and on-demand. We developed a second generation of this dialysate preparation system to enhance reliability and improve cost. We have, however, elected to delay further work on this dialysate generation system so that we may dedicate more of our research and development spending and activities to our other ongoing projects.
We expect to continue to release enhancements to our next generation System One cycler and Nx2me platform this year and into the future as part of our continuous product improvements efforts. We continue to work to introduce our next generation critical care system with our first market launch expected outside the U.S. in the first half of 2019. We are continuing to seek clarity, based on the current configuration of our peritoneal dialysis system, regarding what the regulatory process and timelines would be for that product in the U.S., although recent information received from the FDA suggests drug regulation will be required. We have never sought or obtained drug approval, and we have no drug manufacturing capabilities. The time and capital required to obtain these may be significant. At this time, we are, therefore, choosing to focus our peritoneal dialysis development efforts on international markets, with the UK being our first market. Based on our current estimates, we hope to introduce our peritoneal dialysis system in the UK at some point in 2019. Each of these development timelines is subject to significant risks, including our ability to conclude product development efforts, and then the time and expense required to obtain regulatory approval.
The dates provided reflect our current expectations and are subject to the risks and uncertainties that are set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report.
Our Products and Services
The following section describes our product offerings.
Home Dialysis
Our home product offerings currently target the home hemodialysis market. The NxStage System One is a small, portable, easy-to-use hemodialysis system that is used to perform treatments during the day or at night, while sleeping. The System One is the only portable hemodialysis system that is cleared by the FDA for in-center and hospital use (2002), for home hemodialysis (2005), home nocturnal hemodialysis (2014) and solo home hemodialysis (2017). Its simplicity and compact size are intended to allow for easy use in patients’ homes or other home-like settings and give patients the opportunity to travel with their therapy. 
 10

System One - Home
In addition to our machine, we provide patients with the following proprietary consumables and services which are used for each treatment with the System One:

- | The NxStage Cartridge. A disposable, integrated treatment cartridge that loads simply and easily into the System One. The cartridge incorporates a proprietary volumetric fluid management system and includes a pre-attached dialyzer. 


- | PureFlow SL and Premixed Dialysate. Our PureFlow SL accessory prepares on-site premixed dialysate fluid in batches before treatment in the patient’s home using ordinary tap water and dialysate concentrate. The volume of fluids used varies with treatment options, prescription and setting. To accommodate patient travel with the System One or in other circumstances in which the PureFlow SL is not available, we also supply premixed dialysate in sterile five liter bags. 


- | Nx2me Connected Health. Our Nx2me Connected Health platform leverages cloud-based computing and wireless communications by using an application we developed for the iPad. The Nx2me Connected Health application collects important System One cycler data, as well as patient information such as blood pressure and weight. Patients can review, confirm, and transmit this data to their dialysis centers after each treatment and dialysis center staff can access the transmitted data with their own clinician portal. This gives the staff enhanced capabilities to review and follow treatment adherence and progress as well as the ability to transfer this data directly into their electronic health records system. 

Unlike traditional dialysis systems, the System One does not require any special disinfection and its operation does not require specialized electrical or plumbing infrastructure or modifications to the home. Trained patients can bring the System One home, plug it into a conventional electrical outlet and operate it, thereby eliminating what can be expensive plumbing and electrical household modifications required by traditional dialysis systems.
In early 2017, we received FDA approval and CE Mark approval for our next-generation hemodialysis system. This system includes new features and enhancements including software changes improving ease of use and set up time, a touch screen user interface, and an integrated blood pressure cuff. 
 11

Critical Care
The System One also delivers a range of renal replacement therapies within the critical care market. The System One sold to hospitals for critical care is based on the same technology platform used in the home market but offers a wider range of therapies, including therapeutic plasma exchange. We configure our critical care system with an intuitive touch screen display that provides real-time treatment information as well as easy troubleshooting capabilities for hospital staff and an ergonomic mobile stand for exceptional portability.
System One - Critical Care
We also supply related disposable cartridges and treatment fluids necessary to perform dialysis treatment in the critical care market.
The clinical flexibility of the System One, coupled with its ease of use and portability, make our system well suited for hospital critical care environments.
In June 2013, we entered into a research and development program sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense to develop an innovative device for use in military applications under a government sponsored program. This program aligns well with our technology and we expect that we will continue to leverage this product development work in the advancement of our next-generation critical care system. We expect that the design of our next-generation critical care system will incorporate a small footprint, intuitive touch screen interface and a multi-stream fluid 
 12

management system (which expands the therapeutic capabilities of the system beyond those of the System One to include therapies such as hemodiafiltration). 
In-Center
We sell extracorporeal disposable products under our Medisystems brand that are primarily used for in-center hemodialysis treatments for ESRD patients. These products include hemodialysis blood tubing sets, arteriovenous (AV) fistula needles, apheresis needles, safety accessories and access management disposables.
Our Streamline blood tubing sets feature an efficient and airless design intended to enable providers to optimize dose delivery, and includes our patented LockSite needleless access sites, eliminating the need for sharp needles or costlier guarded needles to be used with the tubing set in connection with dialysis therapy. In addition, our Streamline Express dialyzer features a pre-attached blood tubing set, which is designed to reduce the number of touch point contamination sites. Our AV fistula and apheresis needles have been designed to achieve a smooth blood flow throughout the treatment, intended to result in less clotting, fewer pressure drops, and less stress on the patient’s blood. 
NxStage Kidney Care
We operate a small number of NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers, independently and in some instances as joint ventures, that treat ESRD patients directly. These centers have provided us with valuable experience to better meet and anticipate the needs of both our customers and patients, while optimizing our product technology. In addition, these centers have provided us with the opportunity to innovate and foster new care delivery models to advance the standard of renal care across other settings. More specifically, at NxStage Kidney Care we offer a range of treatment options, including home hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and flexible in-center hemodialysis. 
Our Reporting Segments
We report our operating results through three segments: System One, In-Center and Services. Our other business activities relate primarily to the manufacturing of dialyzers for sale to Asahi. Together with certain research and development and general and administrative expenses that are excluded from our business segment operating results, these business activities are reported in the Other category. We refer to our System One segment, In-Center segment and Other category as our products business. Additional financial information regarding our business segments and geographic data about our assets are contained in Note 9, Business Segment and Geographic Information to our consolidated financial statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report. A discussion of the risks attendant to our operations is set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report.
System One
Our System One segment includes worldwide revenues from sales of the System One and PureFlow SL dialysate preparation equipment and sales of disposable products in the home and critical care markets. Sales of our System One and related products to our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers are included in System One segment home market revenues, which are then eliminated upon consolidation. Some of our largest customers in the home market provide outsourced renal dialysis services to some of our customers in critical care. Sales of products to both markets are made primarily through dedicated sales forces to dialysis centers and hospitals and delivered directly to the customer, or their patients, with certain products sold through distributors. In addition to specialized sales representatives, we also employ nurses in our sales force as clinical educators to support our sales efforts. We have a staff of customer support specialists to assist patients, clinics and hospitals with product orders and deliveries. We also provide technical support 24 hours a day, seven days a week through a dedicated staff of technical support representatives, to respond to questions raised by patients, clinics and hospitals concerning the System One.
Home. We market and sell the System One to dialysis clinics in the U.S. and other markets, which in turn provide the System One to their ESRD patients for chronic home hemodialysis treatment. In the U.S., Medicare regulations require that all chronic ESRD patients be under the care of a dialysis clinic, whether they are treated at home or in clinic. As a result, we do not sell the System One directly to Medicare patients. A significant majority of System One equipment in the home is paid for upfront by our customers versus rented under our month-to-month rental program. 
The upfront payment includes service for an initial contractual period after which the customer pays a standard service fee.
We use a depot service model for equipment servicing and repair. If a device requires repair, we arrange for a replacement device to be shipped to the site of care, whether it is a patient’s home or a clinic, and for pick up and return to us of the system requiring service. This shipment is done by common carrier and, as there are no special installation requirements, the patient or clinic can quickly and easily set up the new machine.
Training is offered to new clinic customers, whereby our clinical educators train the clinic’s nurses and dialysis technicians on the proper use of the System One using our proprietary training materials. We then rely on our customers’ trained 
 13

technicians and nurses to train home patients, their care partners and other technicians and nurses using the System One. In general, we are not responsible for, and do not provide, patient training except for NxStage Kidney Care patients. Patient training takes place at the clinic primarily during the patient’s prescribed treatment sessions. Training typically takes three to four weeks and consists of (1) basic education about ESRD, (2) training patients and care partners on inserting needles into the patient’s vascular access site and (3) instruction on the use and operation of the System One. Reimbursement for training sessions is provided by Medicare, at a fixed rate, and private insurance.
For each month that a patient is treated with the System One, we bill the clinic for the purchase of the related disposable cartridges and treatment fluids necessary to perform treatment, and other related services, where applicable.
Our customers for products used in the home are highly consolidated. DaVita and Fresenius own and operate the two largest chains of dialysis clinics in the U.S. and are our two largest customers for products used in the home. Collectively, they provide treatment to more than two-thirds of U.S. dialysis patients and a similar portion of our home patients, and account for the majority of our System One segment revenues. Increased sales to DaVita and Fresenius have driven a large portion of our historical revenue growth and will be important to future growth. Our home agreements with DaVita and Fresenius are intended to support the continued expansion of patient access to home hemodialysis with the System One, but like all our agreements with home customers, these agreements are not requirements contracts and contain no minimum purchase volumes. Our home agreement with DaVita extends through December 31, 2018, with monthly renewals thereafter unless terminated by either party with 30 days' prior notice. Our home agreement with Fresenius continues to renew on a monthly basis unless we and Fresenius choose to modify the terms with an amendment or new agreement.
 Critical Care. We market the System One directly to hospitals for treatment of acute kidney failure and fluid overload in the U.S. and other geographies. Most of our critical care customers use the System One to perform prolonged or continuous renal replacement therapy for their acute kidney failure or fluid overload patients. We position the System One as a differentiated platform for the delivery of renal care in acute settings because of its technologically innovative features, ease of use and portability. The System One’s continuous volumetric balancing offers a simple effluent drainage capacity. It also uses a disposable, integrated treatment cartridge to minimize maintenance and disinfection requirements, and pre-mixed dialysate to free it from cumbersome water processing systems. 
A significant majority of System One equipment in the critical care market is purchased rather than rented by our customers. Purchased equipment pricing includes service during our standard one-year warranty period, and we sell one, two and three-year service contracts for post-warranty periods. We also offer a bio-medical training program, whereby we train bio-medical engineers on how to service and repair certain aspects of the System One in the critical care setting. Unlike the home market, we do not use a depot service model for equipment servicing and repair, but instead generally service critical care equipment in the field. The nature of the hospital critical care setting, coupled with the practices of other intensive care unit dialysis equipment suppliers, requires that we offer on-site support for our systems in this environment, or for the use of a trained bio-medical engineer.
After selling or renting a System One to a new hospital customer, our clinical educators generally train the hospital’s intensive care unit and acute dialysis nurses on the proper use of the System One using our proprietary training materials. We then rely on the trained nurses to train other nurses. By adopting this “train the trainer” approach, our sales nurses do not need to return to the hospital each time a new nurse requires training. 
We also supply hospitals using the System One with related disposable cartridges and treatment fluids necessary to perform treatment.
International. We sell the System One and certain other products internationally, through a combination of direct sales to dialysis clinics and hospitals in the UK and Canada, and sales through distributors in Europe and other select markets. Products sold to distributors are shipped directly to distributor warehouses and the distributors sell or rent our products to dialysis providers or hospitals and are responsible for marketing, clinic training and equipment servicing and repair. 
We entered the international market in 2009 and to date our international sales have been limited and focused primarily on the home market. We have entered a limited number of geographies and we believe that there is a large opportunity for us to expand sales of our System One and other products outside the U.S. Several of our product development initiatives, including our next-generation critical care system, will be important to these efforts.
In-Center
Our In-Center segment includes revenues from the sale of blood tubing sets and needles for hemodialysis, primarily for the treatment of ESRD patients at dialysis clinics, and needles for apheresis. Our in-center customers are independent dialysis clinics as well as dialysis clinics that are part of national or regional chains. Although in many instances we have direct contractual relationships with our customers, nearly all of our sales in this segment are made through national distributors in order to leverage national networks, shipping efficiencies and existing customer relationships. We plan our manufacturing and distribution activities based on distributor purchase orders. Finished goods are shipped directly to distributor warehouses. We 
 14

support distributor selling and marketing efforts with brand marketing support and a team of clinical educators who assist with clinical in-service activities.
We market our extracorporeal disposable products under the Medisystems brand, which we acquired in 2007. Medisystems branded products have an established reputation for quality, ease of use and innovation, and have been in the in-center market since 1981. In our marketing efforts, we emphasize our Medisystems products’ strong clinical performance and cost-effectiveness.
Our In-Center segment revenues are highly concentrated in several significant purchasers. Henry Schein, Inc. accounted for 23% of our 2017 In-Center segment revenues. B. Braun Medical, Inc. accounted for 22% of our 2017 In-Center segment revenues. Gambro AB (a subsidiary of Baxter International, Inc.) accounted for 21% of our 2017 In-Center segment revenues, with all of Gambro's sales of our products being to DaVita. 
Services
Our Services segment includes revenues from dialysis services provided to patients at our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers. As of February 3, 2018, we had 21 centers accepting patients in 13 states. At these centers, we continue to explore innovative service delivery models with our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers to advance the standard of renal care. Some of our service models vary on the number of treatment stations within a center, the configuration of the center and hours of operation. However, at all of our centers, we provide patients with a range of therapy options to address their clinical and lifestyle needs. For appropriate patients, such therapies may include home hemodialysis, flexible in-center hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.
Clinical Evidence
The vast majority of ESRD patients in the U.S. are prescribed traditional in-center hemodialysis, which consists of three dialysis sessions per week, typically at 3 to 4 hours per session, in a clinical setting. Despite falling mortality rates in hemodialysis patients during the past decade, rates remain much higher than in age-matched U.S. residents. Notably, among 
 15

patients under age 50, mortality rates are 25 to 55 times higher than in general U.S. residents. Significant clinical literature strongly supports that home and more frequent hemodialysis therapy can lead to improved clinical outcomes.
Home Hemodialysis
Studies have consistently shown that home hemodialysis may offer enhanced health, control and freedom to ESRD patients. Several observational studies have found home hemodialysis to be associated with a lower mortality risk compared to in-center hemodialysis. Home therapy may also be an effective way by which to increase patient engagement in the delivery of dialysis, with accumulating health services research suggesting improved outcomes with higher patient activation. In addition, home patients are afforded a newfound independence and control over their care that can result in an improved quality of life.
More Frequent Hemodialysis
The traditional thrice weekly hemodialysis schedule is a clear departure from normal physiology in which the kidneys continuously filter blood. Accompanying each interval between consecutive dialysis sessions, changes in serum biochemistry and volume status may increase risks of both acute (e.g., cardiac arrhythmia) and chronic (e.g., end organ damage) complications. The roughly 72-hour interval between consecutive sessions on Friday and Monday or Saturday and Tuesday appears to be especially problematic. Multiple studies have suggested that this interval is associated with increased risks of mortality and morbidity. 
More frequent hemodialysis, defined as the range of schedules that eliminates multiple-day intervals between consecutive sessions, mitigates the “unphysiology” of the usual hemodialysis schedule. Regimens range from every-other-day dialysis to daily dialysis. Accumulating evidence, including randomized clinical trials and large observational studies, indicates that more frequent hemodialysis confers multiple benefits, including reduced risk of cardiovascular morbidity, improved regulation of blood pressure and phosphorus and reduced need for related medications, better tolerability of hemodialysis and improved physical and mental quality of life.
Cardiovascular Disease. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in hemodialysis patients. An important predictor of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in dialysis patients is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a condition marked by enlargement and thickening of the walls of the left ventricle. LVH is an adaptive response to increased cardiac work, typically caused by combined pressure and volume overload. Multiple studies show that more frequent hemodialysis reduces left ventricular mass and is associated with significantly lower risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, particularly due to heart failure and hypertensive disease.
Blood Pressure and Antihypertensive Medications. Hypertension is a cardinal feature of ESRD, with the prevalence of hypertension exceeding 85% in new ESRD patients. Highly elevated blood pressure is associated with poor outcomes in dialysis patients. With three hemodialysis sessions per week, blood pressure climbs during the interdialytic interval, in step with interdialytic weight gain, particularly among elderly patients and those with higher dry weight. Multiple randomized clinical trials show that frequent hemodialysis reduces blood pressure and the need for oral medications indicated for hypertension.
Serum Phosphorus and Phosphate Binders. ESRD patients commonly have elevated levels of serum phosphorus (hyperphosphatemia). Hyperphosphatemia is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular death. The treatment of hyperphosphatemia is burdensome. Dialysis patients consume on average 19 pills per day and 9 are phosphate binders. Moreover, Medicare Part D expenditures on binders for dialysis patients exceeded $840 million in 2014. Meanwhile, adherence to phosphate binders is poor, especially in younger patients and those with high pill burden. Multiple randomized clinical trials show that frequent hemodialysis reduces serum phosphorus. In observational research, frequent hemodialysis is also associated with a lower percentage of patients using binders.
Dialysis Tolerability. Dialysis treatment can be difficult to tolerate. Recurrent complications during and after the hemodialysis session may limit treatment persistence and engender withdrawal, which is the primary cause of death in 10% to 15% of patients. Long recovery time after treatment is common with the thrice-weekly hemodialysis schedule. In one study, recovery time was between two and six hours for 41% of hemodialysis patients and greater than six hours for 27%; recovery time greater than six hours was associated with substantially higher risks of death and hospitalization. In our prospective, observational FREEDOM (Following Rehabilitation, Economics, and Everyday Dialysis Outcome Measurements) study of daily home hemodialysis, recovery time was sharply reduced after 12 months of treatment, from roughly eight hours at baseline to merely one hour in per-protocol analysis. Meanwhile, recovery time after nocturnal hemodialysis may be only minutes in duration. In matched cohort studies, daily home hemodialysis was associated with almost 40% lower risk of death due to withdrawal or cachexia, relative to each of thrice-weekly in-center hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. By decreasing recovery time after treatment, frequent hemodialysis can improve the tolerability of dialysis treatment and may reduce the incidence of withdrawal from dialysis. 
Quality of Life: Physical Health. Characteristics of poor physical health-related quality of life (HRQoL) include limitations in physical, self-care and social activities; severe bodily pain; frequent tiredness; and low self-rating of physical 
 16

health. Mean physical HRQoL in hemodialysis patients is much lower than the U.S. general population norm. In both randomized clinical trials and prospective cohort studies, more frequent hemodialysis improves physical HRQoL. More frequent hemodialysis is also associated with improvements in restless legs, especially in patients with severe symptoms, and sleep disturbances, including daytime somnolence.
Quality of Life: Mental Health. Characteristics of poor mental HRQoL include frequent psychological distress, social disability due to emotional problems and low self-rating of mental health. Poorer mental health, as measured by the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form, has been associated with increased risks of both death and hospitalization in hemodialysis patients. Frequent hemodialysis can address depressive symptoms, as shown in our FREEDOM study. More frequent hemodialysis also has led to improvement in overall mental health, including large improvements in vitality and social functioning.
Potential Risks
In spite of the benefits of more frequent hemodialysis on cardiovascular function, health-related quality of life, and treatment tolerability, more frequent hemodialysis, including more frequent hemodialysis performed at home, may introduce specific risks pertaining to vascular access complications, infections, loss of residual renal function and increased burden on caregivers. All forms of hemodialysis, including treatments performed in-center and at home, involve some risks. In addition, there are certain risks unique to treatment in the home environment. Patients differ and not everyone will experience the reported benefits of home or more frequent hemodialysis. Certain risks associated with hemodialysis treatment are increased when performing solo home hemodialysis, because no one is present to help the patient respond to health emergencies, and when performing nocturnal therapy due to the length of treatment time and because therapy is performed while the patient and care partner are sleeping.
Our Competition
The dialysis therapy industry is highly dynamic, and we face competition from many sources. We believe that our competitive strengths include the quality and ease of use of our products and our history of leveraging innovative technology to deliver high value, clinically flexible solutions. 
Home Hemodialysis
The System One is the first portable system indicated for home hemodialysis, home nocturnal hemodialysis, and solo home hemodialysis in the U.S, and the only such system commercially available in the U.S. Multiple competitors provide more traditional systems for hemodialysis therapy. Outside of the U.S., the System One also competes against products that are more similar in design to the System One that are also cleared for home use.
Critical Care
The System One is also used in the critical care market. In the U.S., we compete predominantly with Gambro (a subsidiary of Baxter) in the critical care market as well as with multiple competitors that provide more traditional dialysis equipment used in intensive care units. Outside of the U.S., we compete in the critical care market with Gambro, Fresenius, Nikkiso Co. Ltd., B. Braun Medical, Inc. (B. Braun) and several smaller companies. 
In-Center
Our Medisystems branded bloodlines, needles and other consumables are sold to U.S. in-center providers and compete against products produced by Fresenius, Nipro Medical Corporation, JMS Co. Ltd. and others. Outside the U.S., we face competition from many firms, including B. Braun and Baxter, together with its subsidiary Gambro.
Services
The U.S. dialysis services industry is highly competitive. A majority of U.S. dialysis centers are operated by the two largest dialysis organizations, DaVita and Fresenius, with the remaining facilities allocated among several mid-sized dialysis organizations and a number of small dialysis organizations and local hospitals. 
Intellectual Property
We seek to protect our investment in the research, development, manufacturing and marketing of our products through the use of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret law. We own rights to a number of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property directly related and important to our business both in the U.S. and abroad. We also have domestic and foreign pending patent applications. Any of our trade secrets, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent could be misappropriated, or independently developed by, a competitor and could, under some circumstances, be used to prevent us from further use of such information, know-how or technology. We require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements with us. We also require our employees to agree to disclose and assign to us inventions 
 17

conceived by them during their employment. Similar obligations are imposed upon consultants and advisors performing work for us relating to the design or manufacture of our products. Despite efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
Patents. Our strategy is to develop patent portfolios for our research and development projects. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods of time according to the date a patent application is filed or a patent is granted and the term of the patent protection available in the jurisdiction granting the patent. The scope of protection provided by a patent can vary significantly from country to country.
As of December 31, 2017, we had 145 U.S. and foreign counterpart issued patents and 67 U.S. and foreign counterpart patent applications pending. The issued patents and pending patent applications cover, among other things:
•safety technology for automated blood treatments;

• | control and mechanical features aimed at set-up including priming of blood circuits and preparation of fluids including dialysate for hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis;


• | blood circuit improvements aimed at safety, cost effectiveness and convenience;


• | control technology aimed at reliability and safety of blood treatment machines;


• | sensor technology including temperature and pressure sensors; and


• | administration of peritoneal dialysis.

The approximate expiration periods for our issued patents are as follows:

Expiration | Portion of Patent Portfolio
Within the next 5 years | 38% 
6-10 years | 38% 
11-15 years | 21% 
16-20 years | 3% 

Hemodialysis technologies have been in existence for over fifty years, and there are thousands of patents held by third parties that relate to dialytic technologies. Collectively, our patents and other intellectual property are important to us, although there is no single patent or other intellectual property right that is solely responsible for protecting our products. We believe that the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.
Product Development
Our product development organization is working to develop innovative technical approaches that address the limitations of current dialysis systems and disposable products. We focus our development innovation on new hardware and disposables that allow for lower cost and higher capability. This includes developing new sensors, software, disposable designs, pump designs, manufacturing techniques, assembly automation, plastic processing technologies, and user interfaces, to name a few of our important development areas. Our development team has skills across the range of technologies required to develop and maintain dialysis systems and products, including filters, tubing sets, mechanical systems, fluids, software and electronics. 
We are continually working on enhancements to our product designs to improve ease of use, functionality, reliability and safety and to reduce product cost. We also seek to develop new products that supplement our existing product offerings, such as our next-generation critical care system and peritoneal dialysis system, and intend to continue to actively pursue research and development opportunities for complementary products. Our product development timelines primarily depend on our ability to achieve clinical endpoints, regulatory and legal requirements and to overcome technology challenges.
We continue to make significant investments in our product development. Our research and development expenses were $39.6 million (10% of total revenues), $31.0 million (8% of total revenues) and $26.2 million (8% of total revenues) during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Manufacturing
We have significant manufacturing infrastructure dedicated to high-volume plastics disposables production. We have manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Germany and Italy. Manufacturing innovation of process and automation is a critical capability that has contributed to our ability to manufacture high quality, low-cost products. We have designed most of our production automation ourselves. At our facility in Tijuana, Mexico, we perform a number of manufacturing operations relating to our System One equipment and disposables and in-center bloodlines, and we service System One equipment. We manufacture our dialyzer filters at a facility in Germany owned by Asahi and operated by us, and we perform molding activities 
 18

at our facility in Italy. We complement our internal production capabilities by outsourcing the manufacture of premixed dialysate, needles and some components. 
We depend upon a number of single-source suppliers for certain of our raw materials, components and finished goods, including the fiber used in our System One filters, our needles and sterile bags, as well as sterilization services. Finding alternative sources for these raw materials, components, finished goods and sterilization services would be difficult and in many cases entail a significant amount of time, disruption and cost. Where obtaining a second source is more difficult, we have tried to establish supply agreements that better protect our continuity of supply, although we do not have supply agreements with all of our single-source suppliers. Where we have no agreements in place, we work, to the extent economically feasible, to maintain enough inventory of the single-sourced component to allow us to, if needed, satisfy our requirements for the component while we secure an alternative source of supply. 
Some of our most critical supply relationships are with Membrana GmbH and Laboratorios PiSA S.A. de C.V.
Membrana is our only supplier of the fiber used in our filters for System One products under an agreement that expires in December 2023, and contractually we cannot obtain an alternative source of fiber for our System One products. While our relationship with Asahi could afford us back-up supply in the event of supply disruptions at Membrana, we do not have the regulatory approvals necessary to use Asahi fiber in our System One cartridge.
Laboratorios PiSA supplies substantially all of our premixed dialysate. Our supply agreement with Laboratorios PiSA extends through December 2019. We have committed to purchase from Laboratorios PiSA a minimum quantity of premixed dialysate over the term of the agreement. While we purchase premixed dialysate from another qualified supplier, any significant disruption in Laboratorios PiSA’s ability to supply premixed dialysate to us would impair our business, at least in the near term.
Government Regulation
In the U.S., numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market and, for our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers, the manner in which we administer and submit claims for patient care. In the foreign countries in which we market and sell our products, we are subject to local regulations affecting, among other things, design and product standards, packaging and labeling and promotion requirements.
Food and Drug Administration
In the U.S., our products are subject to regulation by the FDA as medical devices. The FDA regulates the design, development, clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution, import and export, sale and promotion of medical devices. Noncompliance with applicable FDA requirements can result in, among other things:
•untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
•unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; 
•customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products; 
•operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
•refusing or delaying our requests for regulatory approvals or clearances of new products or modified products; 
•withdrawing PMA approvals that have already been granted; 
•refusal to grant export approval for our products; or 
•criminal prosecution.
Unless an exemption applies, all medical devices must receive either premarket notification or "510(k)" clearance or an approved pre-market approval application (PMA) from the FDA before they may be commercially distributed in the U.S. To obtain a 510(k) clearance for a device, a pre-market notification to the FDA must be submitted demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. The FDA attempts to respond to a 510(k) pre-market notification within 90 days of submission, but as a practical matter, pre-market clearance can take significantly longer, potentially up to one year or more. 
Modifications to marketed products may require new regulatory approvals or clearances, including 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals. If a manufacturer determines that a modification to an FDA-cleared device could significantly affect its safety or efficacy, or would constitute a major change in its intended use, then the manufacturer must file for a new 510(k) clearance or possibly a premarket approval application. For those products sold in the EU, manufacturers must notify their EU Notified Body if significant changes are made to the products or if there are substantial changes to the quality assurance systems affecting those products. 
 19

High risk devices deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, or devices not deemed substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, require the approval of a PMA. The PMA process is much more demanding and uncertain than the 510(k) pre-market notification process and must be supported by extensive clinical, technical and other information, including at least one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation. The FDA has 180 days from the date of filing to review an accepted PMA, although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years.
FDA Regulatory Status
We currently have all of the regulatory clearances required to market the System One in the U.S. in both the home and critical care markets, all of which have thus far been granted as 510(k) clearances. The FDA has cleared the System One for the treatment, under a physician’s prescription, of renal failure or fluid overload using hemofiltration, hemodialysis and/or ultrafiltration. The FDA has also specifically cleared the System One for home hemodialysis, home nocturnal hemodialysis and solo home hemodialysis use under a physician’s prescription.
We continue to seek opportunities for product improvements and feature enhancements, which will, from time to time, require FDA clearance or approval before commercial launch. 
Continuing FDA Regulation
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply, including:

• | Product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;


• | Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;


• | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication;


• | clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;


• | approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our approved devices;


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;


• | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;


• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device;


• | the FDA's recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations;


• | regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and


• | notices of corrections or removals.

We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer. The FDA seeks to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements through periodic facility inspections and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors.
Foreign Regulation of Medical Devices
We are also subject to regulations in the foreign countries in which we market and sell our products. Foreign regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country, relate to, among other things, product standards, packaging, labeling and promotion requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements.
Clearance or approval of our products by regulatory authorities comparable to the FDA, or in the case of the EU the affixing of the CE mark, are required in foreign countries prior to marketing the product in those countries, whether or not FDA clearance has been obtained. The regulatory requirements for medical devices vary significantly from country to country. They can involve requirements for additional testing and may be time consuming and expensive. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain regulatory approvals in any other markets or be able to affix the CE mark to new products in the EU.
 20

In the specific case of the EU, manufacturers of medical devices are required to conduct an assessment of the conformity of the devices with the Essential Requirements found in Annex I to Council Directive 93/42/EEC of June 14, 1993 concerning medical devices, commonly known as the Medical Devices Directive, and to affix a CE mark to these devices prior to marketing these within the EU. The Essential Requirements govern the quality, safety and performance of the medical devices. The classification of individual medical devices will determine whether the participation by a notified body in the conformity assessment process will be necessary. Notified bodies are private organizations that are licensed by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States to conduct conformity assessment procedures and to verify the conformity of manufacturers and their medical devices with the Essential Requirements. If, where the participation by a notified body is necessary, the outcome of the conformity assessment procedure is positive the notified body will issue a related CE Certificate of Conformity. The manufacturer of the device will then complete the technical file for the medical device and, after having prepared and signed a related Declaration of Conformity, affix the CE mark to the product.
Moreover, on May 25, 2017 the new Medical Devices Regulation (2017/745 or MDR) entered into force. Following its entry into application on May 26, 2020, the Regulations will introduce substantial changes to the obligations with which medical device manufacturers must comply in the EU. Higher risk medical devices will be subject to additional scrutiny during the conformity assessment procedure. 
CE Certificates of Conformity have been issued in relation to all of our products that require such certificates and we have affixed a CE mark to these products. However, if we introduce any substantial change to any of our CE marked medical devices in the EU this may require an additional conformity assessment process in relation to the substantial changes and modification or preparation of new CE Certificates of Conformity and Declarations of Conformity.
In the EU we must comply with a number of regulatory requirements for products that have been CE marked and offered for sale relating to:
•registration of medical devices;
•pricing and reimbursement of medical devices;
•establishment of post-marketing surveillance and adverse event reporting procedures;
•field safety corrective actions, including product recalls and withdrawals;
•marketing and promotion of medical devices; and
•interactions with physicians.
Failure to comply with these requirements may result in enforcement measures being taken by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. These can include fines, administrative penalties, compulsory product withdrawals, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Such enforcement measures would have an adverse effect on the marketing of our products in the EU and, consequently, on our business and financial position.
Licensure and Certification
Our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers must be certified by CMS to receive Medicare payments. In some states, these centers must also secure additional state licenses, permits or certificates of needs. Governmental authorities, primarily state departments of health, periodically inspect our centers to determine if we satisfy applicable federal and state standards and requirements, including the conditions of coverage by the Medicare ESRD program.
Fraud and Abuse Laws
U.S. federal healthcare laws apply when our customers and NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally-funded healthcare programs. The principal federal fraud and abuse laws include: 

• | the Anti-Kickback Statute, which among other things prohibits the offer or payment of any remuneration for the purpose of inducing or rewarding patient referrals or the order, purchase or recommendation of items or services reimbursable by a federal healthcare program;


• | the False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally-funded healthcare program or causing such claims to be submitted; and


• | criminal healthcare fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payors.

There are often similar state anti-kickback and false claims laws that apply to state-funded Medicaid and other healthcare programs, as well as to private third-party payors. In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act can be used to prosecute companies in the U.S. for arrangements with physicians or other parties outside the U.S. if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the laws of that country. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer’s products or of a provider’s services from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment.
Similar laws are increasingly being introduced in the individual European states. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medical devices is prohibited by the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European states. One such example is the UK Bribery Act. Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must also be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer or competent professional organization or the competent authorities of the individual European states. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct applicable in the European states. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational harm, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Anti-Kickback and Related Statutes
The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, and similar state laws, prohibit payments and other forms of remuneration that are intended to induce healthcare professionals or others either to refer patients or to purchase, lease, order or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease or order of healthcare products or services. Other laws prohibit remuneration that the offeror knows or should know is likely to induce patients to select a particular provider of services, including for dialysis. A number of states have enacted laws that require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report payments, gifts and other remuneration made to physicians and other healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations or marketing expenditures. In addition, some state statutes, most notably laws in Massachusetts and Vermont, impose outright bans on certain manufacturer gifts to physicians or other health care professionals. Some of these laws, referred to as “aggregate spend” or “gift” laws, carry substantial fines if they are violated. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act was enacted by Congress in 2010 as part of the comprehensive Affordable Care Act health care reform legislation, and the implementing regulations, released in February 2013, require us to collect and report certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals annually to CMS for public reporting. It is widely believed that public reporting under the Sunshine Act results in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals.
 21

The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and potentially prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, the statute contains some exceptions and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) has issued a series of regulations, known as safe harbors, implementing these exceptions and establishing some additional protected areas of conduct. These safe harbors set forth conditions that, if met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG. If scrutinized, arrangements that implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute, and that do not fall within a safe harbor, are analyzed by the OIG and other enforcement authorities on a case-by-case basis with review based on the totality of the facts and circumstances to assess whether a given arrangement involves the kind of conduct the Anti-Kickback Statute was intended to prohibit.
Government officials have focused recent enforcement efforts on, among other things, the sales and marketing activities of medical device manufacturers and other healthcare companies, and recently have brought cases against individuals or entities with personnel who allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business. Judgments and settlements of these cases by healthcare companies have involved significant fines and, in some instances, criminal pleas and convictions. Further, the 2010 Affordable Care Act specified that any claims submitted as a result of a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute are also false claims and subject to enforcement under the False Claims Act. 
In addition to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, many states have their own anti-kickback laws. Often, these laws closely follow the language of the federal law, although they do not always have the same exceptions or safe harbors. In some states, these anti-kickback laws apply with respect to all payors, including commercial health insurance companies.
The national legislation and industry codes of many foreign countries includes provisions equivalent in content and consequences to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the Sunshine Act.
False Claims Laws
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers are directly subject to these laws with respect to the reimbursement claims they file with Medicare and other government payors. In addition, medical device manufacturers can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, if they are found to have caused the submission of false claims, including through the provision of billing, coding or reimbursement advice or through arrangements that violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. The federal False Claims Act also includes whistleblower provisions that allow private citizens to bring suit against an entity or individual on behalf of the U.S. and to recover a portion of any monetary recovery. Many of the recent highly publicized settlements in the healthcare industry related to the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers have been cases brought under the False Claims Act. In addition, amendments to the False Claims Act included in the Affordable Care Act impose severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of identified overpayments collected from governmental payors. Within 60 days of identifying an overpayment, a provider is required to notify CMS or its contractor of the overpayment and the reason for it and return the overpayment. These amendments could subject our procedures for identifying and processing overpayments to greater scrutiny.
Violations of The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, commonly known as the Stark Law, can also form the basis for False Claims Act liability. The Stark Law generally prohibits a physician from referring a patient to an entity for certain designated health services payable by Medicare or Medicaid when the physician has a financial relationship with the entity, such as an investment interest or a medical directorship, unless an exception applies. While outpatient dialysis services and most drugs furnished by our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers are excluded from the Stark Law's prohibitions on self-referrals, certain outpatient prescription drugs furnished by those centers may be subject to the Stark Law.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Several states have false claims laws that apply to all payors. including commercial insurance plans. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, and fines, exclusion of a manufacturer’s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment.
The national legislation of many foreign countries includes provisions equivalent in content and consequences to the federal false claims laws.
Compliance Program
The healthcare laws and fraud and abuse laws applicable to our business are complex and subject to variable interpretations. We maintain certain compliance review, education and training and other programs to further our commitment 
 22

to high standards of ethical and legal conduct and to endeavor to minimize the likelihood that we would engage in conduct or enter into arrangements in violation of applicable authorities. For example, we have (1) established a compliance team consisting of representatives from our Legal, Finance, Human Resources, Regulatory Affairs/Quality Assurance and Commercial departments that meets regularly; (2) established a compliance hotline that permits our employees to report anonymously any compliance issues that may arise; and (3) instituted other safeguards intended to help prevent any violations of the applicable fraud and abuse laws and healthcare laws, and to remediate any situations that could give rise to violations. We also review many of our transactions and agreements, both past and present, with qualified legal counsel to help ensure they are compliant.
Through our compliance efforts, we constantly strive to structure our business operations and relationships with our customers to comply with all applicable legal requirements. However, many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are broad in scope and may be interpreted or applied by prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authorities in ways that we cannot predict. Thus, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws differently or assert non-compliance with respect to one or more of our business operations and relationships. Moreover, the standards of business conduct expected of healthcare companies under these laws and regulations have become more stringent in recent years, even in instances where there has been no change in statutory or regulatory language. If a claim were asserted against us for alleged non-compliance with fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws or other healthcare laws, and we were not to prevail, possible penalties and sanctions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to conduct our operations.
Privacy and Security
In the course of performing our business we obtain, from time to time, confidential patient health information. For example, we learn patient names and addresses when we ship our System One supplies and related products to home hemodialysis patients. We may learn patient names and be exposed to confidential patient health information when we provide training on our products to our customers’ staff. Our home hemodialysis patients call our customer service representatives directly and during the call may disclose confidential patient health information. We also receive and maintain confidential patient health information in connection with the operation of our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers. U.S. federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, in particular individually identifiable information, and restrict the use and disclosure of that information. At the federal level, the Department of Health and Human Services promulgated health information privacy, security and breach notification regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (collectively, HIPAA). We are subject to HIPAA with regard to certain aspects of our business. In addition, many other state and federal laws regulate the use and disclosure of health information, including state medical privacy laws, state breach notification laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws. In many cases, these laws are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, particularly if they afford greater protection to the individual than does HIPAA. These various laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies creating potentially complex compliance issues for our business. Violations of HIPAA may result in penalties and enforcement actions by the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR). OCR has recently increased its enforcement efforts on compliance with HIPAA, including the security regulations (Security Rule), bringing actions against entities which have failed to implement security measures sufficient to reduce risks to electronic protected health information or to conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis, among other violations. HIPAA enforcement actions may lead to monetary penalties and costly and burdensome corrective action plans. 
We are also subject to laws and regulations in foreign countries covering data privacy and other protection of health and employee information that may be more onerous than corresponding U.S. laws. These regulations may require that we obtain individual consent before we collect or process any personal data, restrict our use or transfer of personal data, impose technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data, and require that we notify regulatory agencies, individuals or the public about any data security breaches. As we expand our international operations, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with multiple data privacy laws. For example, the EU Data Protection Directive imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze, and transfer EU personal data. Moreover, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an EU-wide regulation that will be fully enforceable by May 25, 2018, will introduce new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for violations of the data protection rules. 
Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. 
Reimbursement
Home and In-Center
Medicare regulations require that all Medicare ESRD patients requiring dialysis be under the care of a dialysis clinic, whether they are treated at home or in-clinic. We sell or rent our System One and sell our needles and blood tubing sets to dialysis clinics. These clinics, in turn, are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers. According to the 2017 United States Renal Data Systems (USRDS) Annual Data Report, Medicare or Medicaid is the primary payor for approximately 83% of dialysis patients using hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. The report also indicates that approximately 5% of patients are covered by commercial insurance with Medicare as the secondary payor, with the remaining 12% of patients classified by the USRDS as “other” or “unknown.” Certain centers have indicated that more frequent home hemodialysis therapy with the System One attracts a higher percentage of commercial insurance patients than other forms of dialysis.
Medicare. Medicare generally provides health insurance coverage for persons who are age 65 or older and for persons who are completely disabled. For ESRD patients, however, Medicare coverage is not dependent on age or disability. Patients are eligible for Medicare based solely on ESRD. Coverage for patients eligible for Medicare based solely on ESRD begins on the first day of the fourth month after the patient begins dialysis treatments. During the three-month waiting period, Medicaid, private insurance or the patient is responsible for payment for dialysis services. Medicare waives this waiting period for individuals who participate in a home dialysis training program, or are hospitalized for a kidney transplant and the surgery occurs within a specified time period.
For ESRD patients under age 65 who have any employer group health insurance coverage, regardless of the size of the employer or the individual’s employment status, Medicare coverage is generally secondary to the employer coverage during the 30-month period that follows the establishment of Medicare eligibility or entitlement based on ESRD. During this period, the patient’s existing insurer is responsible for paying primary benefits at the rate specified in the applicable group health plan, which may be a negotiated rate or the healthcare provider’s usual and customary rate. As the secondary payor during this period, Medicare will make payments up to the applicable Medicare payment rate for dialysis services to supplement any primary payments by the employer group health plan if the plan covers the services but pays only a portion of the charge for the services.
Medicare generally is the primary payor for ESRD patients after the 30-month coordination period. Under current rules, Medicare is also the primary payor for ESRD patients during the 30-month period under certain circumstances. Medicare remains the primary payor when an individual becomes eligible for Medicare on the basis of ESRD if (1) the individual was already age 65 or over or was eligible for Medicare based on disability and (2) the individual’s private insurance coverage is not by reason of current employment or, if it is, the employer has fewer than 20 employees (in the case of eligibility by reason of age) or fewer than 100 employees (in the case of eligibility by reason of disability). The rules regarding entitlement to primary 
 23

Medicare coverage when the patient is eligible for Medicare on the basis of both ESRD and age, or disability, have been, and may continue to be, the subject of frequent legislative and regulatory changes.
When Medicare is the primary payor for services furnished by dialysis clinics, it reimburses dialysis clinics for 80% of the allowable rate, leaving the secondary insurance or the patient responsible for the remaining 20%.
As a result of legislation passed by the U.S. Congress more than 30 years ago, Medicare provides broad and well established reimbursement in the U.S. for ESRD. Effective January 1, 2011, CMS implemented a new prospective payment system for dialysis treatment. Under the ESRD prospective payment system, CMS generally makes a single bundled payment to the dialysis facility for each dialysis treatment that covers all renal dialysis services and home dialysis and includes certain drugs (including erythropoiesis stimulating agents, iron and Vitamin D). The prospective payment system replaced the former system, which paid facilities a composite rate for a defined set of items and services, while paying separately for drugs, laboratory tests, and other services that were not included in the composite rate. With a vast majority of U.S. ESRD patients covered by Medicare, the Medicare reimbursement rate is an important factor in a potential customer’s decision to use the System One or our other products and limits the fees for which we can sell or rent our products. Additionally, current CMS rules limit the number of hemodialysis treatments paid for by Medicare to three times a week, unless there is medical justification provided by the dialysis facility based on information from the patient’s physician for additional treatments. Because the home setting provides the most practical and economic setting for the implementation of alternative therapy delivery models that have been well-documented to offer significant clinical and quality of life benefits, most patients using the System One in the home have been prescribed to receive more than three treatments per week. To the extent that Medicare contractors determine they will not pay for additional treatments, adoption of the System One would likely be impaired and revenues from our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers likely would be reduced.
Medicare has been consolidating the Medicare contractors that process and pay Medicare claims. Accordingly, there have been and may continue to be changes in the contractors that determine medical justification for dialysis treatments. This change in the reviewing entity for Medicare claims could lead to a change in whether a customer receives Medicare reimbursement for additional treatments. If an adverse change to historical payment practices occurs, adoption of our System One for home hemodialysis may be impaired and revenues from our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers likely would be reduced.
Based on a 2008 analysis of historical Medicare payment files by the University of Michigan Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center, those delivering more frequent dialysis at home receive reimbursement, on average, for 1.5 times the number of treatments per month versus conventional dialysis, although this amount varies by jurisdiction. This variance arises from Medicare contractor policies, as well as from varying center billing practices. Currently, only four of the twelve Medicare contractor jurisdictions have issued formal local coverage determinations that describe medical justification for more frequent hemodialysis. Recently, however, seven Medicare contractors have issued proposed local coverage determinations setting forth a limited set of medical conditions that would constitute medical justification for more frequent hemodialysis in their respective jurisdictions. The proposed local coverage determinations are nearly identical across Medicare contractors and would cover approximately 90% of existing dialysis units. We believe the proposed local coverage determinations are inconsistent with long-standing Medicare policy, including that reiterated in recent Medicare payment rules, current clinical literature and locally accepted standards of care. In partnership with other provider, patient, and professional organizations, we are actively engaged in the comment process for the proposed local coverage determinations. If the proposed local coverage determinations were adopted in their current form, they would adversely affect our business by significantly restricting patient access to home and more frequent hemodialysis.
As there is no consistent national standard for what constitutes medical justification, a clinic’s decision as to how much it is willing to spend on home dialysis equipment and services will be at least partly dependent on the level of confidence the center has in the predictability of receiving reimbursement from Medicare for additional treatments per week based on submitted claims for medical justification.
A stated goal of the ESRD prospective payment system was to encourage home dialysis. To date, it has not had a positive impact on the adoption of home or more frequent hemodialysis or the price for which we can sell our products. However, the prospective payment system has had a significant positive impact on the adoption of peritoneal dialysis as evidenced by the significantly increased rates of training for peritoneal dialysis. We believe this increased focus on peritoneal dialysis growth and peritoneal dialysis training has been to the detriment of home hemodialysis training rates, as home training resources, including home training nurses in particular, have been more devoted to peritoneal dialysis training, leaving less time for home hemodialysis training.
Medicaid. Medicaid programs are state-administered programs partially funded by the federal government. These programs are intended to provide coverage for certain categories of patients whose income and assets fall below state defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured. For those who are eligible, the programs serve as supplemental insurance programs for the Medicare co-insurance portion and provide certain coverage, such as for self-administered outpatient prescription medications, that is not provided by Medicare. For ESRD treatment, state regulations generally follow Medicare coverage and 
 24

reimbursement levels, but without any co-insurance amounts, which is pertinent mostly for the three-month waiting period for Medicare coverage. Certain states, however, require beneficiaries to pay a monthly share of the cost based upon levels of income or assets.
Private Insurers. Some ESRD patients have private insurance that covers dialysis services. Healthcare providers, including our NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers, receive reimbursement for ESRD treatments from the patient or private insurance during a waiting period of up to three months before the patient becomes eligible for Medicare. In addition, if the private payor is an employer group health plan, it is generally required to continue to make primary payments for dialysis services during the 30-month period following eligibility or entitlement to Medicare. In general, employers may not reduce coverage or otherwise discriminate against ESRD patients by taking into account the patient’s eligibility or entitlement to Medicare benefits. On average, private insurance pays significantly more for dialysis services than Medicare and these patients with private insurance are generally viewed as more profitable to dialysis service providers. 
Critical Care
For Medicare patients, both acute kidney failure and fluid overload therapies provided in an in-patient hospital setting are reimbursed under a traditional Medicare severity diagnosis related group system. Under this system, reimbursement is determined based on a patient’s primary diagnosis and is intended to cover all of the hospital’s costs of treating the patient. The presence of acute kidney failure or fluid overload increases the severity of the primary diagnosis and, accordingly, could increase the amount reimbursed. Longer hospitalization stays and higher labor needs, which are typical for patients with acute kidney failure and fluid overload, must be managed for care of these patients to be cost-effective. We believe that there is a significant incentive for hospitals to find a more cost-efficient way to treat these patients in order to improve hospital economics for these therapies.
Reimbursement Outside of the U.S.
The use of our products outside the U.S. is similarly affected by reimbursement policies adopted by foreign regulatory agencies, government managed health care systems and private insurance. Reimbursement for the treatment of patients using medical devices in the EU Member States is governed by complex mechanisms established on a national level in each country. These mechanisms vary widely among the EU Member States. Moreover, these mechanisms evolve constantly, reflecting the efforts of these countries to reduce public spending on healthcare. 
The rules on the coverage and reimbursement of medical devices outside the U.S. and EU vary widely from country to country and often from hospital to hospital. In addition, healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures in many foreign countries could, among other things, limit the use of our products and treatments in those countries and further reduce reimbursement available for such use or eliminate coverage altogether. These reforms or cost containment measures, including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect, could have an adverse effect on our customers’ purchasing decisions regarding our products and treatments within these regions, as well as limit the prices we may charge for our products.
