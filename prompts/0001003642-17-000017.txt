Item 1.       Business
Overview

We are a specialty pharmaceutical company applying formulation and development expertise, as well as our drug delivery technology, to the development, manufacture and marketing of bioequivalent pharmaceutical products, commonly referred to as “generics,” in addition to the development, manufacture and marketing of branded products. We operate in two segments, referred to as “Impax Generics” and “Impax Specialty Pharma.” The Impax Generics division includes our legacy Global Pharmaceuticals business as well as the acquired businesses of CorePharma, LLC ("CorePharma") and Lineage Therapeutics, Inc. ("Lineage") from our acquisition of Tower Holdings, Inc. ("Tower") and its subsidiaries on March 9, 2015 (the "Tower Acquisition"). The Impax Specialty Pharma division includes our legacy Impax Pharmaceuticals business as well as the acquired business of Amedra Pharmaceuticals, LLC ("Amedra") from the Tower Acquisition. Impax Generics concentrates its efforts on generic products, which are the pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalents of brand-name drug products and are usually marketed under their established nonproprietary drug names rather than by a brand name. Impax Specialty Pharma utilizes its specialty sales force to market proprietary branded pharmaceutical products for the treatment of central nervous system (“CNS”) disorders and other select specialty segments. Impax Specialty Pharma also generated revenue from research and development services provided to an unrelated third-party pharmaceutical entity (which agreement was terminated by mutual agreement of the parties effective December 23, 2015). See “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules — Note 23. Segment Information,” for financial information about our segments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Our Strategy

We plan to continue to expand our Impax Generics division by targeting complex solid oral and alternative dosage form Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”) with high revenue potential, including products with the potential to be first-to-file or first-to-market. Our products and product candidates are generally difficult to formulate and manufacture, providing certain competitive advantages. In addition to our product pipeline of 25 pending applications at the FDA as of December 31, 2016, we are continuing to evaluate and pursue external growth initiatives including acquisitions and partnerships. For instance, during 2016, we completed the acquisition of certain assets, including marketed and pipeline generic products, from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (acting directly or through its affiliates) and affiliates of Allergan plc (the "Teva Transaction"). Refer to "Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules - Note 2. Business Acquisitions" for more information on the Teva Transaction. 
The following information summarizes our generic pharmaceutical product development activities since inception through December 31, 2016:


• | 136 ANDAs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), including four tentatively approved (i.e., satisfying substantive FDA requirements but remaining subject to statutory restrictions). In addition, we have rights to market and/or share in profits to 16 approved ANDAs held by our third party alliance partners. The approved ANDAs (including those held by our partners) include generic versions of brand name pharmaceuticals such as Adderall XR®, Lofibra®, Opana ER® (NDA 021610), Pulmicort Respules® and Solaraze®.


• | 25 applications pending at the FDA that represent approximately $14 billion in 2016 U.S. product sales.


• | A number of products in various stages of development for which applications have not yet been filed.

A core component of our strategy includes an ongoing focus in our Impax Specialty Pharma division on proprietary brand-name pharmaceutical products to treat CNS disorders and other specialty segments. We believe that we have the research, development and formulation expertise to develop branded products that will deliver significant improvements over existing therapies. We plan to continue investing in our development pipeline, both internally and through acquisitions and partnerships primarily focused on late-stage and next generation product opportunities.

Impax Generics Division

In the generic pharmaceutical market, we focus our efforts on developing, manufacturing, selling and distributing complex solid dose and alternative dosage form products covering a broad range of therapeutic areas and having technically challenging drug-delivery mechanisms or unique product development formulations. We employ our technologies and formulation expertise to develop generic products that reproduce brand-name products’ physiological characteristics but do not infringe any valid patents relating to such brand-name products. Generic products contain the same active ingredient and are of the same route of administration, dosage form, strength and indication(s) as brand-name products already approved for use in the United States by the FDA. We generally focus our generic product development on brand-name products as to which the patents covering the active pharmaceutical ingredient have expired or are near expiration, and we employ our experience to develop bioequivalent versions of such brand-name products. We also develop, manufacture, sell and distribute specialty generic pharmaceuticals that we believe present certain competitive advantages, such as difficulty in raw materials sourcing, complex formulation or development characteristics or special handling requirements. We have generally obtained rights to our alternative dosage form products through third party alliance and collaboration agreements, such as through our partnership agreement with Tolmar, Inc. (“Tolmar”).

We sell and distribute generic pharmaceutical products primarily through four sales channels:

• | the “Impax Generics sales channel" for sales of generic prescription products we sell directly to wholesalers, large retail drug chains, and others;


• | the “Private Label sales channel" for generic pharmaceutical over-the-counter (“OTC”) and prescription products we sell to unrelated third party customers who in-turn sell the product to third parties under their own label;


• | the “Rx Partner sales channel" for generic prescription products sold through unrelated third-party pharmaceutical entities under their own label pursuant to alliance agreements; and


• | the “OTC Partner sales channel" for sales of generic pharmaceutical OTC products sold through unrelated third-party pharmaceutical entities under their own label pursuant to alliance agreements.

As of December 31, 2016, we marketed 207 generic pharmaceutical products representing dosage variations of 72 different pharmaceutical compounds through our Impax Generics division, and five other generic pharmaceutical products, representing dosage variations of two different pharmaceutical compounds, through our alliance and collaboration agreement partners. As of December 31, 2016, our significant marketed generic products were Epinephrine Auto-Injector (generic Adrenaclick®), oxymorphone hydrochloride extended release tablets (AB rated to original OPANA® ER), diclofenac sodium gel 3% (generic Solaraze®), and fenofibrate (generic Lofibra®).
As of December 31, 2016, we had 25 applications pending at the FDA. The following table lists our publicly identified product applications pending at the FDA as of December 31, 2016:


Product | Generic of 
Aspirin/Dipyridamole ER Capsules 25/200 mg | Aggrenox®

Impax Specialty Pharma

Impax Specialty Pharma is engaged in the development, sale and distribution of proprietary branded pharmaceutical products that we believe represent improvements to already-approved pharmaceutical products addressing CNS disorders and other select specialty segments. We estimate there are approximately 16,000 neurologists in the United States. Historically, a concentrated number of these neurologists are responsible for writing the majority of neurology prescriptions. CNS is the largest therapeutic category in the United States with 2016 sales of about $69.3 billion, or 15.4% of the $450 billion U.S. prescription drug market. CNS product sales contracted -3.7% in 2016, compared to 6% growth for the overall pharmaceutical market, while total CNS prescriptions increased 1.6%, slightly less than the overall pharmaceutical industry growth rate of 2%. (Source: IMS Health). 

Our branded pharmaceutical product portfolio consists of commercial CNS and other select specialty products, as well as development stage projects. In February 2012, we licensed from AstraZeneca UK Limited ("AstraZeneca") the exclusive U.S. commercial rights to Zomig® (zolmitriptan) tablet, orally disintegrating tablet and nasal spray formulations pursuant to the terms of a Distribution, License, Development and Supply Agreement with AstraZeneca, which was subsequently amended (the "AZ Agreement") and began sales of the Zomig® products under our label during the year ended December 31, 2012 through our specialty sales force. In May 2013, our exclusivity period for branded Zomig® tablets and orally disintegrating tablets expired and we launched authorized generic versions of those products in the United States. In June 2015, the FDA approved the Zomig® nasal spray for use in pediatric patients 12 years of age or older for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura. In addition to the Zomig® products and our internally developed pharmaceutical product, Rytary® for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication and/or manganese intoxication, which was approved by the FDA on January 7, 2015, we are currently engaged in the sales and marketing of Emverm® (mebendazole) 100 mg chewable tablets, indicated for the treatment of pinworm, whipworm, common roundworm, common hookworm, and two other products, all acquired in our acquisition of Tower and Lineage which closed in March 2015. In November 2015, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Numient® (referred to as Rytary® in the United States). The review of the Numient® application was conducted under the centralized licensing procedure as a therapeutic innovation, and the authorization is applicable in all 28 member states of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. 

We have a couple of product candidates that are in varying stages of development and we currently intend to expand our portfolio of branded pharmaceutical products primarily through internal development and through licensing and acquisitions, with a focus on late-stage product opportunities. 

Alliance and Collaboration Agreements

We have entered into several alliance, collaboration or license and distribution agreements with respect to certain of our products and services and may enter into similar agreements in the future. These agreements typically obligate us to deliver multiple goods and/or services over extended periods. Such deliverables include manufactured pharmaceutical products, exclusive and semi-exclusive marketing rights, distribution licenses, and research and development services. Our alliance and collaboration agreements often include milestones and provide for payments upon achievement of these milestones. For more information about the types of milestone events in our agreements and how we categorize them, see “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules — Note 20. Alliance and Collaboration Agreements.” 
Impax Generics Division – Alliance and Collaboration Agreements

License and Distribution Agreement with Shire

In January 2006, we entered into a License and Distribution Agreement with an affiliate of Shire Laboratories, Inc., which was subsequently amended (“Prior Shire Agreement”), under which we received a non-exclusive license to market and sell an authorized generic of Shire’s Adderall XR® product (“AG Product”) subject to certain conditions, but in any event by no later than January 1, 2010. We commenced sales of the AG Product in October 2009. On February 7, 2013, we entered into an Amended and Restated License and Distribution Agreement with Shire (the “Amended and Restated Shire Agreement”), which amended and restated the Prior Shire Agreement. The Amended and Restated Shire Agreement was entered into by the parties in connection with the settlement of our litigation with Shire relating to Shire’s supply of the AG Product to us under the Prior Shire Agreement. Under the Amended and Restated Shire Agreement, Shire was required to supply the AG Product and we were responsible for marketing and selling the AG Product subject to the terms and conditions thereof until the earlier of (i) the first commercial sale of our generic equivalent product to Adderall XR® and (ii) September 30, 2014 (the “Supply Term”), subject to certain continuing obligations of the parties upon expiration or early termination of the Supply Term, including Shire’s obligation to deliver AG Products still owed to us as of the end of the Supply Term. We are required to pay a profit share to Shire on sales of the AG Product, of which we owed a profit share payable to Shire of $7.5 million, $19.5 million and $21.1 million on sales of the AG Product 
7

during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with a corresponding charge included in the cost of revenues line in the consolidated statement of operations. Although the Supply Term expired on September 30, 2014, we were permitted to sell any AG Products in our inventory or owed to us by Shire under the Amended and Restated Shire Agreement until all such products are sold. We sold all remaining AG Products in our inventory during the year ended December 31, 2016. We continued to pay a profit share to Shire on sales of such products during the year ended December 31, 2016. 

Development, Supply and Distribution Agreement with Tolmar, Inc.
In June 2012, we entered into a Development, Supply and Distribution Agreement with Tolmar (the "Tolmar Agreement"). Under the terms of the Tolmar Agreement, Tolmar granted us an exclusive license to commercialize up to 11 generic topical prescription drug products, including ten currently approved products in the United States and its territories; the parties agreed in 2015 to terminate development efforts of one product under the Tolmar Agreement that had been pending approval at the FDA. Under the terms of the Tolmar Agreement, Tolmar is responsible for developing and manufacturing the products, and we are responsible for marketing and sale of the products. As of December 31, 2016, we were currently marketing and selling four approved products. We are required to pay a profit share to Tolmar on sales of each product commercialized pursuant to the terms of the Tolmar Agreement.

We paid Tolmar a $21.0 million upfront payment upon signing of the agreement and, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, are also required to make payments to Tolmar up to an aggregate amount of $25.0 million upon the achievement of certain specified milestone events. The contingent milestone payments are initially recognized in the period the triggering event occurs. Milestone payments which are contingent upon commercialization events are accounted for as an additional cost of acquiring the product license rights. Milestone payments which are contingent upon regulatory approval events are capitalized and amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the approved product. As of December 31, 2016, we had paid a total of $20.0 million to Tolmar upon the achievement of certain specified milestone events, including $12.0 million upon the achievement of a regulatory milestone event and $5.0 million upon the achievement of a commercialization event and do not currently expect to make any additional milestone payments to Tolmar under the agreement. The $21.0 million upfront payment for the Tolmar product rights has been allocated to the underlying topical products based upon the relative fair value of each product and will be amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of each underlying product, ranging from five to 12 years, starting upon commencement of commercialization activities by us during the second half of 2012. The amortization of the Tolmar product rights has been included as a component of cost of revenues on our consolidated statement of operations. We are also required to pay a profit share to Tolmar on sales of the topical products, of which we owed a profit share payable to Tolmar of $36.4 million, $77.7 million and $16.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with a corresponding charge included in the cost of revenues line in our consolidated statement of operations.

We entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Tolmar in March 2012 (the “Tolmar Loan Agreement”), under which we agreed to lend to Tolmar one or more loans through December 31, 2014, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $15.0 million. The outstanding principal amount of, including any accrued and unpaid interest on, the loans under the Tolmar Loan Agreement are payable by Tolmar beginning from March 31, 2017 through March 31, 2020 or the maturity date, in accordance with the terms therein. Pursuant to the Tolmar Loan Agreement, Tolmar could prepay all or any portion of the outstanding balance of the loans prior to the maturity date without penalty or premium. In May 2016, Tolmar repaid in full the $15.0 million due to us under the Tolmar Loan Agreement.

Mebendazole Product Acquisition Agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.

In August 2013, we, through our Amedra Pharmaceuticals subsidiary, entered into a product acquisition agreement (the “Mebedanzole Product Acquisition Agreement”) with Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (“Teva”) pursuant to which we acquired the assets (including the ANDA and other regulatory materials) and related liabilities related to Teva’s mebendazole tablet product in all dosage forms. Pursuant to the Mebendazole Product Acquisition Agreement, we are required to pay certain milestone payments up to an aggregate amount of $3.5 million upon the approval and launch of the mebendazole tablet product; we paid the $3.5 million to Teva during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 upon the FDA's approval and our subsequent launch of Emverm® (mebendazole) 100 mg chewable tablets. We are also obligated to pay Teva a royalty payment based on net sales of Emverm®, including a specified annual minimum royalty payment, subject to customary reductions and the other terms and conditions set forth in the Mebedanzole Product Acquisition Agreement.

Rx Partner and OTC Partner Alliance Agreements

We have entered into alliance agreements with unrelated third-party pharmaceutical companies pursuant to which our partner distributes a specified product or products which we developed and, in some cases manufacture. Pursuant to these alliance agreements we typically receive payment on delivery of the product, and share in the resulting profits, or receive a royalty or other payments from our partners. Our alliance agreements are separated into two sales channels, the “Rx Partner” sales channel, for generic prescription products sold through our partners under their own label, and the “OTC Partner” sales channel, for sales of generic pharmaceutical OTC products sold through our partner under their own label. The revenue recognized and the percentage of gross revenue for each of the periods noted, for the Rx Partner and the OTC Partner alliance agreements, was as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015 | 2014
(in thousands) | | | | 
Gross Revenue and % Gross Revenue | | | | | | | 
Rx Partner | $ | 14,339 | | 1 | % | $ | 9,307 | 1 | % | $ | 14,114 | 1 | %
OTC Partner | $ | 225 | | * | | $ | 1,744 | 1 | % | $ | 1,319 | 1 | %

* Not material
Strategic Alliance Agreement with Teva

We are a party to a Strategic Alliance Agreement dated as of June 27, 2001 with Teva Pharmaceutical USA, Inc. ("Teva USA"), an affiliate of Teva, which was subsequently amended (“Teva Agreement”). The Teva Agreement commits us to develop and manufacture, and Teva to distribute, a specified number of controlled release generic pharmaceutical products (“generic products”), each for a 10-year period. As of December 31, 2016, we were supplying Teva with oxybutynin extended release tablets (Ditropan XL® 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg extended release tablets); the other products under the Teva Agreement have either been returned to us, are being manufactured by Teva at its election, were voluntarily withdrawn from the market or our obligations to supply such product had expired or were terminated in accordance with the Teva Agreement.
For more information about the Teva Agreement, see “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules – Note 20. Alliance and Collaboration Agreements.”

OTC Partner Alliance Agreements

In June 2002, we entered into a Development, License and Supply Agreement with Pfizer, Inc., formerly Wyeth LLC (“Pfizer”), for a term of 15 years, relating to our Loratadine and Pseudoephedrine Sulfate 5 mg/120 mg 12-hour Extended Release Tablets (the "D12 Product") and Loratadine and Pseudoephedrine Sulfate 10 mg/240 mg 24-hour Extended Release Tablets for the OTC market (the "D24 Product"); the agreement was terminated with respect to the D24 Product in 2005. We previously developed the products and are currently only responsible for manufacturing the products. Pfizer is responsible for marketing and sale of the products. The agreement included payments to us upon achievement of development milestones, as well as royalties paid to us by Pfizer on its sales of the product. Pfizer launched this product in May 2003 as Alavert® D-12 Hour. In December 2011, we and Pfizer entered into an agreement with L. Perrigo Company (“Perrigo”), which was subsequently amended whereby the parties agreed that we would supply our D-12 Product to Perrigo in the United States and its territories. The agreements with Pfizer and Perrigo are no longer a core area of our business, and the over-the-counter pharmaceutical products we sell to Pfizer and Perrigo under the agreements are older products which are only sold to Pfizer and Perrigo. We recognize profit share revenue in the period earned. 
During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we sold the ANDAs for both the D12 Product and the D24 Product, in addition to other specified assets, to Perrigo pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with Perrigo dated as of March 31, 2016 (the "Perrigo APA"). Under the terms of the Perrigo APA, we will also continue to supply the D-12 Product to Pfizer and Perrigo until the date that is the earliest of (i) the date Perrigo’s manufacturing facility is approved to manufacture the D-12 Product and (ii) December 31, 2017 (the "Supply End Date"). On the Supply End Date, we will assign and transfer our supply agreement with Pfizer in its entirety to Perrigo in accordance with the Perrigo APA.

Agreements with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.

In November 2008, we entered into a Joint Development Agreement and a License and Settlement Agreement ("Joint Development Agreement") with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., formerly Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation (“Valeant”), providing for collaboration in the development of a total of five dermatology products, including four of our generic products and one branded advanced form of Valeant’s Solodyn® product. We have the potential to receive up to an additional $8.0 million of contingent milestone payments each of which we believe to be substantive, as well as the potential to receive royalty payments from sales, if any, by Valeant of its advanced form Solodyn® brand product. Finally, to the extent we commercialize any of the four generic dermatology products covered by the Joint Development Agreement, we will pay to Valeant a gross profit share on sales of such products. We began selling one of the four generic dermatology products during the year ended December 31, 2011 and began selling a second dermatology product during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.
For more information about the Joint Development Agreement with Valeant, see “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules – Note 20. Alliance and Collaboration Agreements.”

Distribution, License, Development and Supply Agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited

In January 2012, we entered into the AZ Agreement with AstraZeneca and the parties subsequently entered into a First Amendment to the AZ Agreement dated May 31, 2016 (as amended, the "AZ Amendment"). Under the terms of the AZ Agreement, AstraZeneca granted us an exclusive license to commercialize the tablet, orally disintegrating tablet and nasal spray formulations of Zomig® (zolmitriptan) products for the treatment of migraine headaches in the United States and in certain U.S. territories, except during an initial transition period when AstraZeneca fulfilled all orders of Zomig® products on our behalf and AstraZeneca paid us the gross profit on such Zomig® product sales. We are obligated to fulfill certain minimum requirements with respect to the promotion of currently approved Zomig® products as well as other dosage strengths of such products approved by the FDA in the future. We may, but have no obligation to, develop and commercialize additional products containing zolmitriptan and additional indications for Zomig®, subject to certain restrictions as set forth in the AZ Agreement. Subject to the terms of the AZ Agreement, we will be responsible for conducting clinical studies and preparing regulatory filings related to the development of any such additional products and would bear all related costs. During the term of the AZ Agreement, AstraZeneca will continue to be the holder of the NDA for existing Zomig® products, as well as any future dosage strengths thereof approved by the FDA, and will be responsible for certain regulatory and quality-related activities for such Zomig® products. AstraZeneca will manufacture and supply Zomig® products to us and we will purchase our requirements of Zomig® products from AstraZeneca until a date determined in the AZ Agreement. Thereafter, AstraZeneca may terminate its supply obligations upon certain advance notice to us, in which case we would have the right to manufacture or have manufactured our own requirements for the applicable Zomig® product. Under the terms of the AZ Amendment, under certain conditions and depending on the nature and terms of the study agreed to with the FDA, we agreed to conduct, at our own expense, the juvenile toxicity study and pediatric study required by the FDA under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) for approval of the nasal formulation of Zomig® for the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients ages six through eleven years old, as further described in the study protocol mutually agreed to by the parties (the “PREA Study”). In consideration for us conducting the PREA Study at our own expense, the AZ Amendment provides for the total royalty payments payable by us to AstraZeneca on net sales of Zomig® products under the AZ Agreement to be reduced by certain specified amounts beginning from the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and through the quarter ended December 31, 2020, with such reduced royalty amounts totaling an aggregate amount of $30.0 million. In the event the royalty reduction amounts exceed the royalty payments payable by us to AstraZeneca pursuant to the AZ Agreement in any given quarter, AstraZeneca will be required to pay us an amount equal to the difference between the royalty reduction amount and the royalty payment payable by us to AstraZeneca. Our commitment to perform the PREA Study may be terminated, without penalty, under certain circumstances as set forth in the AZ Amendment. 


10

Under the terms of the AZ Agreement, AstraZeneca was required to make payments to us representing 100% of the gross profit on sales of AstraZeneca-labeled Zomig® products during the specified transition period. Beginning from January 2013, we have paid AstraZeneca tiered royalties on net sales of branded Zomig® products, depending on brand exclusivity and subject to customary reductions and other terms and conditions set forth in the AZ Agreement. We also paid AstraZeneca royalties based on gross profit from sales of authorized generic versions of the Zomig® products subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the AZ Agreement. In May 2013, our exclusivity period for branded Zomig® tablets and orally disintegrating tablets expired and we launched authorized generic versions of those products in the United States. As discussed above, pursuant to the AZ Amendment, the total royalty payments payable by us to AstraZeneca on net sales of Zomig® products under the AZ Agreement is reduced by certain specified amounts beginning from the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and through the quarter ended December 31, 2020, with such reduced royalty amounts totaling an aggregate amount of $30.0 million. We owed a royalty payable to AstraZeneca of $17.2 million, $16.8 million and $14.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with a corresponding charge included in the cost of revenues line on our consolidated statements of operations. 

Agreement with DURECT Corporation
During the three month period ended March 31, 2014, we entered into an agreement with DURECT Corporation (“Durect”) granting us the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize DURECT’s investigational transdermal bupivacaine patch for the treatment of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia, which we refer to as IPX239. We paid Durect a $2.0 million up-front payment upon signing of the agreement which we recognized immediately as research and development expense. We have the potential to pay up to an aggregate of $61.0 million in additional contingent milestone payments upon the achievement of certain specified development and commercialization events under the agreement. If IPX239 is commercialized, we would also be required to pay a tiered royalty based on product sales.
Our Controlled-Release Technology

We have developed a number of different controlled-release delivery technologies which may be utilized with a variety of oral dosage forms and drugs. Controlled-release drug delivery technologies are designed to release drug dosages at specific times and in specific locations in the body and generally provide more consistent and appropriate drug levels in the bloodstream than immediate-release dosage forms. Controlled-release pharmaceuticals may improve drug efficacy, ensure greater patient compliance with the treatment regimen, reduce side effects or increase drug stability and be more patient friendly by reducing the number of times a drug must be taken.

We believe our controlled-release drug delivery technologies are flexible and can be applied to develop a variety of pharmaceutical products, both generic and branded. Our technologies utilize a variety of polymers and other materials to encapsulate or entrap the active pharmaceutical ingredients and to release them at varying rates or at predetermined locations in the gastrointestinal tract.

Competition

The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is affected by new technologies, new developments, government regulations, health care legislation, availability of financing, and other factors. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial, research and development, marketing, and other resources than we have. We compete with numerous other companies that currently operate, or intend to operate, in the pharmaceutical industry, including companies that are engaged in the development of controlled-release drug delivery technologies and products, and other manufacturers that may decide to undertake development of such products. Our principal competitors in the generic pharmaceutical products market are Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Mylan N.V., Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Lannett Company, Inc., Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Endo International plc and Sandoz.

Due to our focus on relatively hard to replicate controlled-release products, competition in the generic pharmaceutical market is sometimes limited to those competitors who possess the appropriate drug delivery technology. The principal competitive factors in the generic pharmaceutical market are:


• | the ability to introduce generic versions of products promptly after a patent expires;


• | price;


• | product quality;


• | customer service (including maintenance of inventories for timely delivery); and


• | the ability to identify and market niche products.


11

In the brand-name pharmaceutical market, our principal competitors are pharmaceutical companies that are focused on Parkinson’s disease and other CNS disorders. In addition, with respect to products that we are developing internally and/or any additional products we may in-license from third parties, we expect that we will face increased competition from large pharmaceutical companies, drug delivery companies and other specialty pharmaceutical companies that have focused on the same disorders as our branded products.

A description of the competition we face from brand-name and generic pharmaceutical companies is included in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Sales and Marketing

We market and sell our generic pharmaceutical prescription drug products within the continental United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. We have not made sales in any other jurisdictions over the last three fiscal years. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales to a limited number of customers. The customer base for our products consists primarily of drug wholesalers, warehousing chain drug stores, mass merchandisers, and mail-order pharmacies. We market our products both directly, through our Impax Generics and Impax Specialty Pharma divisions, and indirectly through our Rx Partner and OTC Partner alliance and collaboration agreements. Together, our five major customers, McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Amerisource-Bergen, N.C. Mutual and CVS Caremark Corporation, accounted for 90% of our gross revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. These five customers individually accounted for 40%, 28%, 20%, 1% and 1%, respectively, of our total gross revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. We do not have long-term contracts in effect with our five major customers. A reduction in or loss of business with any one of these customers, or any failure of a customer to pay us on a timely basis, would adversely affect our business.
Manufacturing and Distribution

We source our finished dosage form products from our own facilities in Hayward, California; Middlesex, New Jersey; and Taiwan. We also use several contract manufacturers for this purpose. During 2015, we restructured our packaging and distribution operations. As a result, we closed our Philadelphia packaging site and all of our company-wide distribution operations were outsourced to United Parcel Services (UPS). During 2016, the Board of Directors approved a plan to close the Middlesex, New Jersey manufacturing and packaging site, which was then amended to repurpose a part of the Middlesex manufacturing site as a research and development pilot plant.

We maintain an inventory of our products in connection with our obligations under our alliance and collaboration agreements. In addition, for products pending approval, we may produce batches for inventory in anticipation of the launch of the products. In the event that FDA approval is denied or delayed, we could be exposed to the risk of this inventory becoming obsolete.

The raw materials we use in the production of our products consist of pharmaceutical chemicals in various forms that are generally available from several sources in the United States and throughout the world. In some cases, however, the raw materials, such as the active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) used to manufacture our products, are available only from a single supplier. Further, even if more than one supplier exists, we may choose, and have done so in the case of our API suppliers for a majority of our products, to list only one supplier in our product applications submitted to the FDA. The FDA requires identification of raw material suppliers in applications for approval of drug products. If raw materials were unavailable from a specified supplier or the supplier was not in compliance with FDA or other applicable requirements, the FDA approval of a new supplier could delay the manufacture of the drug involved. As a result, there is no guarantee we will always have timely and sufficient access to a required raw material or other product. Generally, we would need as long as 18 months to find and qualify a new sole-source supplier. If we receive less than one year’s termination notice from a sole-source supplier that it intends to cease supplying raw materials, it could result in disruption of our ability to produce the drug involved. We currently do not have long-term supply agreements with the majority of our API suppliers and although to date we have only experienced occasional interruptions in supplies, no assurance can be given that we will continue to receive uninterrupted or adequate supplies of such raw materials. Any inability to obtain raw materials on a timely basis, or any significant price increases not passed on to customers, could have a material adverse effect on us.

Quality Control

Regulatory agencies such as the FDA regularly inspect our manufacturing facilities and the facilities of our third party suppliers. The failure of one of our facilities, or a facility of one of our third party suppliers, to comply with applicable laws and regulations may lead to breach of representations made to our customers or to regulatory or government action against us related to products made in that facility. We have in the past received a warning letter from the FDA regarding certain operations within our manufacturing network at our Hayward manufacturing facility, which we subsequently resolved in 2015. We remain committed to continuing to improve our quality control and manufacturing practices, however, we cannot be assured that the FDA will continue to be satisfied with our corrective actions and with our quality control and manufacturing systems and standards. Failure to comply strictly with these regulations and requirements may damage our reputation and lead to financial penalties, compliance expenditures, the recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, withdrawal or suspension of the applicable regulator’s review of our submissions, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Further, other federal agencies, our customers and partners in our alliance, development, collaboration and other partnership agreements with respect to our products and services may take any such FDA observations or warning letters into account when considering the award of contracts or the continuation or extension of such partnership agreements. Because regulatory approval to manufacture a drug is site-specific, the delay and cost of remedial actions, or obtaining approval to manufacture at a different facility, could negatively impact our business. Any failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations and/or any actions by the FDA and other agencies as described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations
Research and Development
We conduct most of our research and development activities at our facilities in Hayward, California and Middlesex, NJ, with a staff of 182 employees as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we have outsourced a number of research and development projects to third-party laboratories.

We spent approximately $80.5 million, $70.6 million and $78.6 million on research and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as more fully set out in the tables below (in millions).

We do not generally track research and development expense by individual product in either the Impax Generics division or the Impax Specialty Pharma division.

In the Impax Generics division, we focus our research and development efforts based on drug-delivery technology and on products that we believe may have certain competitive advantages, rather than on any particular therapeutic area. As of December 31, 2016, the Impax Generics division had 25 product applications pending with the FDA and another 26 products in development. Accordingly, we believe that our generic pipeline products will, in the aggregate, generate a significant amount of revenue for us in the future. However, while a generic product is still in development, we are unable to predict the level of commercial success that the product may ultimately achieve given the uncertainties relating to the successful and timely completion of bioequivalence studies, ANDA filing, receipt of marketing approval and resolution of any related patent litigation, as well as the amount of competition in the market at the time of product launch and thereafter and other factors detailed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Additionally, we do not believe that any individual generic pipeline product is currently significant in terms of accrued or anticipated research and development expense given the large volume of products under development in the Impax Generics division, as detailed above. Further, on a per product basis, development costs for generic products tend to be significantly lower than for branded products, as the process for establishing bioequivalence is significantly less extensive than the standard clinical trial process. The regulatory approval process is significantly less onerous as well compared to the process for branded products.

In the Impax Specialty Pharma division, we currently market one internally developed branded pharmaceutical product, Rytary® (IPX066) for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication and/or manganese intoxication, which was approved by the FDA on January 7, 2015 and which we launched in the United States in April 2015. In addition to Rytary®, Impax Specialty Pharma is also currently engaged in the sale and distribution of four other branded products; the more significant include Zomig® (zolmitriptan) products, indicated for the treatment of migraine headaches, under the terms the AZ Agreement, and Emverm® (mebendazole) 100 mg chewable tablets, indicated for the treatment of pinworm, whipworm, common roundworm, common hookworm, and American hookworm in single or mixed infection. We also have a number of product candidates that are in varying stages of development. While we believe the pipeline products in this division are potentially viable, profitable product candidates for us, given the uncertainties relating to the successful completion of clinical trials, the FDA approval process for branded products, reimbursement levels, the amount of competition at the time of product launch and thereafter and other factors detailed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” such pipeline products are too early in the development process to be considered significant at this point in time.
Regulation 

The manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government, primarily through the FDA and the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), and to a lesser extent by state and local governments. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Controlled Substances Act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the manufacture, labeling, testing, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. As described above under "Quality Control", facilities used in the manufacture, packaging, labeling and repackaging of pharmaceutical products must be registered with the FDA and are subject to FDA inspection to ensure that drug products are manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in product recalls, seizure of products, injunctions, suspension of production and/or distribution, refusal of the government or third parties to enter into contracts with us, withdrawal or suspension of the applicable regulator's review of our drug applications, civil penalties and criminal fines, and disgorgement of profits.

FDA approval is required before any “new drug” may be marketed, including new formulations, strengths, dosage forms and generic versions of previously approved drugs. Generally, the following two types of applications are used to obtain FDA approval of a “new drug.”

New Drug Application (“NDA”). For a drug product containing an active ingredient not previously approved by the FDA, a prospective manufacturer must submit a complete application containing the results of clinical studies supporting the drug product’s safety and efficacy. A NDA is also required for a drug with a previously approved active ingredient if the drug will be used to treat an indication for which the drug was not previously approved or if the dosage form, strength or method of delivery is changed. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally involves the steps listed below, which could take from approximately three to more than ten years to complete.


• | Laboratory and clinical tests;


• | Submission of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before clinical studies may begin;


• | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for its intended use;


• | Submission of a NDA containing the results of the preclinical tests and clinical studies establishing the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for its intended use, as well as extensive data addressing such matters such as manufacturing and quality assurance;


• | Scale-up to commercial manufacturing; and


• | FDA approval of a NDA.


As noted above, the submission of a NDA is not a guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing. It may refuse to file the application and instead request additional information, in which case, the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information. After the application is deemed filed by the FDA, FDA staff will review a NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and efficacious for its intended use.

If, after reviewing the NDA, the FDA determines that the application cannot be approved in its current form, the FDA sends the NDA applicant a Complete Response Letter identifying all outstanding deficiencies that preclude final approval. The FDA then halts its review until the applicant resubmits the NDA with new information designed to address the deficiencies. An applicant receiving a Complete Response Letter may resubmit the application with data and information addressing the FDA’s concerns or requirements, withdraw the application without prejudice to a subsequent submission of a related application or request a hearing on whether there are grounds for denying approval of the application. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require an applicant to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market. The agency may also impose requirements that the NDA holder conduct new studies, make labeling changes, implement Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, and take other corrective measures.
Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”). For a generic version of an approved drug — a drug product that contains the same active ingredient as a drug previously approved by the FDA and is in the same dosage form and strength, utilizes the same method of delivery and will be used to treat the same indications as the approved product — the FDA requires only an abbreviated new drug application that ordinarily need not include clinical studies demonstrating safety and efficacy. An ANDA typically requires only data demonstrating that the generic formulation is bioequivalent to the previously approved “reference listed drug,” indicating that the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of the generic drug in the body do not show a significant difference from those of the reference listed drug. In July 2012, the Generic Drug Fee User Amendments of 2012 (“GDUFA”) was enacted into law. The GDUFA legislation implemented fees for new ANDA applications, Drug Master Files, product and establishment fees and a one-time fee for back-logged ANDA applications pending approval as of October 1, 2012. In return, the program was intended to provide faster and more predictable ANDA reviews by the FDA and increased inspections of drug facilities. Under GDUFA, generic product companies face significant penalties for failure to pay the new user fees, including rendering an ANDA application not “substantially complete” until the fee is paid. Prior to the implementation of GDUFA, the FDA took an average of approximately 30 months to approve an ANDA. Following the implementation of GDUFA, the FDA’s stated internal goal for ANDAs submitted in fiscal year 2016 was to have a “first-action” goal date within 15 months of submission on 75% of submitted ANDAs. The “first-action” goal date is referred to by the FDA as the date in which the FDA takes a first action on an application by either granting approval or tentative approval or in the event of deficiencies, identifying those deficiencies in a complete response letter or in a refusal to receive the application.

Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the “Hatch-Waxman Act,” which established the procedures for obtaining approval of generic drugs, an ANDA filer must make certain patent certifications that can result in significant delays in obtaining FDA approval. If the applicant intends to challenge the validity or enforceability of an existing patent covering the reference listed drug or asserts that its drug does not infringe such patent, the applicant files a so called “Paragraph IV” certification and notifies the patent holder that it has done so, explaining the basis for its belief that the patent is not infringed or is invalid or unenforceable. If the patent holder initiates a patent infringement suit within 45 days after receipt of the Paragraph IV Certification, the FDA is automatically prevented from approving an ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the date the Paragraph IV Certification is given to the patent holder, expiration of the patents involved in the certification, or when the infringement case is decided in the ANDA applicant’s favor. In addition, the first company to file an ANDA for a given drug containing a Paragraph IV certification can be awarded 180 days of market exclusivity following approval of its ANDA, during which the FDA may not approve any other ANDAs for that drug product.

During any period in which the FDA is required to withhold its approval of an ANDA due to a statutorily imposed non-approval period, the FDA may grant tentative approval to an applicant’s ANDA. A tentative approval reflects the FDA’s preliminary determination that a generic product satisfies the substantive requirements for approval, subject to the expiration of all statutorily imposed non-approval periods. A tentative approval does not allow the applicant to market the generic drug product.

The Hatch-Waxman Act contains additional provisions that can delay the launch of generic products. A five year marketing exclusivity period is provided for new chemical compounds, and a three year marketing exclusivity period is provided for approved applications containing new clinical investigations essential to an approval, such as a new indication for use, or new delivery technologies, or new dosage forms. The three year marketing exclusivity period applies to, among other things, the development of a novel drug delivery system, as well as a new use. In addition, companies can obtain six additional months of exclusivity if they perform pediatric studies of a reference listed drug product. The marketing exclusivity provisions apply to both patented and non-patented drug products. The Act also provides for patent term extensions to compensate for patent protection lost due to time taken in conducting FDA required clinical studies and during FDA review of NDAs.

The Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992 establishes penalties for wrongdoing in connection with the development or submission of an ANDA. In general, the FDA is authorized to temporarily bar companies, or temporarily or permanently bar individuals, from submitting or assisting in the submission of an ANDA, and to temporarily deny approval and suspend applications to market generic drugs under certain circumstances. In addition to debarment, the FDA has numerous discretionary disciplinary powers, including the authority to withdraw approval of an ANDA or to approve an ANDA under certain circumstances and to suspend the distribution of all drugs approved or developed in connection with certain wrongful conduct. The FDA may also withdraw product approval or take other correct measures if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market.

Other Regulatory Requirements

We are subject to the Maximum Allowable Cost Regulations, which limit reimbursements for certain generic prescription drugs under Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs to the lowest price at which these drugs are generally available. In many instances, only generic prescription drugs fall within the regulations’ limits. Generally, the pricing and promotion of, method of reimbursement and fixing of reimbursement levels for, and the reporting to federal and state agencies relating to drug products is under active review by federal, state and local governmental entities, as well as by private third-party reimbursers and individuals under whistleblower statutes. At present, the Justice Department and U.S. Attorneys Offices and State Attorneys General have initiated investigations, reviews, and litigation into industry-wide pharmaceutical pricing and promotional practices, and whistleblowers have filed qui tam suits. We cannot predict the results of those reviews, investigations, and litigation, or their impact on our business.
Virtually every state, as well as the District of Columbia, has enacted legislation permitting the substitution of equivalent generic prescription drugs for brand-name drugs where authorized or not prohibited by the prescribing physician, and some states mandate generic substitution in Medicaid programs.

In addition, numerous state and federal requirements exist for a variety of controlled substances, such as narcotics, that may be part of our product formulations. The DEA, which has authority similar to the FDA’s and may also pursue monetary penalties, and other federal and state regulatory agencies have far reaching authority.

The State of California requires that any manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer or other entity in California that sells, transfers, or otherwise furnishes certain so called precursor substances must have a permit issued by the California Department of Justice, Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement. The substances covered by this requirement include ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, among others. The Bureau has authority to issue, suspend and revoke precursor permits, and a permit may be denied, revoked or suspended for various reasons, including (i) failure to maintain effective controls against diversion of precursors to unauthorized persons or entities; (ii) failure to comply with the Health and Safety Code provisions relating to precursor substances, or any regulations adopted thereunder; (iii) commission of any act which would demonstrate actual or potential unfitness to hold a permit in light of the public safety and welfare, which act is substantially related to the qualifications, functions or duties of the permit holder; or (iv) if any individual owner, manager, agent, representative or employee of the permit applicant/permit holder willfully violates any federal, state or local criminal statute, rule, or ordinance relating to the manufacture, maintenance, disposal, sale, transfer or furnishing of any precursor substances.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses


We own or license a number of patents in the U.S. and other countries covering certain products and product candidates and have also developed brand names and trademarks for other products and product candidates. Generally, the brand pharmaceutical business relies upon patent protection to ensure market exclusivity for the life of the patent. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks and license rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement. However, our business is not dependent upon any single patent, trademark or license.


In the branded pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product’s commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. In the U.S. and some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed, there can often be very substantial and rapid declines in the branded product’s sales. The rate of this decline varies by country and by therapeutic category; however, following patent expiration, branded products often continue to have market viability based upon the goodwill of the product name, which typically benefits from trademark protection.


An innovator product’s market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: patent rights held by the innovator company and any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovator is entitled.


Patents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the medicine. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses of a drug product, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery mechanisms and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.


Market exclusivity is also sometimes influenced by regulatory exclusivity rights. Many developed countries provide certain non-patent incentives for the development of medicines. For example, the U.S., the EU and Japan each provide for a minimum period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator’s data to approve a competitor’s generic copy. Regulatory exclusivity rights are also available in certain markets as incentives for research on new indications, on orphan drugs and on medicines useful in treating pediatric patients. Regulatory exclusivity rights are independent of any patent rights and can be particularly important when a drug lacks broad patent protection. However, most regulatory forms of exclusivity do not prevent a competitor from gaining regulatory approval prior to the expiration of regulatory data exclusivity on the basis of the competitor’s own safety and efficacy data on its drug, even when that drug is identical to that marketed by the innovator.
We estimate the likely market exclusivity period for each of our branded products on a case-by-case basis. It is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for any of our branded products with certainty because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity, and inherent uncertainties concerning patent litigation. There can be no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that we currently estimate or that the exclusivity will be limited to the estimate.


In addition to patents and regulatory forms of exclusivity, we also market products with trademarks. Trademarks have no effect on market exclusivity for a product, but are considered to have marketing value. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used; in other countries, as long as registered. Registration is for fixed terms and may be renewed indefinitely.

Environmental Laws

We are subject to comprehensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, air polluting emissions, waste water discharges, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the remediation of contamination associated with current or past generation handling and disposal activities. We are subject periodically to environmental compliance reviews by various environmental regulatory agencies. While it is impossible to predict accurately the future costs associated with environmental compliance and potential remediation activities, compliance with environmental laws is not expected to require significant capital expenditures and has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.
