  Services
 AVRL. We sold our entire AVRL business, which provided veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services for veterinarians in the United States to Antech, which transaction closed on March 31, 2015. In connection with this sale of assets, we terminated our strategic alliance with Kansas State University, K-State Veterinary Diagnostic Lab and Kansas State University Institute for Commercialization (formerly known as National Institute for Strategic Technology Acquisition and Commercialization), to provide veterinary diagnostic and laboratory testing and related services. 
Other
 We also generate revenues from the sale of products using our patented Orbos Discrete Lyophilization Process (the Orbos process) to companies for other applications. The Orbos process involves flash-freezing a drop of liquid reagent to form a solid bead and then freeze-drying the bead to remove water. The Orbos beads are stable in dry form and dissolve rapidly in aqueous solutions. The dry reagents used in our reagent discs are produced using the Orbos process. This process allows the production of a precise amount of active chemical ingredient in the form of a soluble bead. We believe that the Orbos process has broad applications in products where delivery of active ingredients in a stable, pre-metered format is desired. 
 We have a supply contract with Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) for products using the Orbos process. In January 2011, we entered into a ten year supplier agreement with Becton, Dickinson and Company to supply products using Abaxis patented Orbos process. In our agreement, BD will be subject to purchase minimum quantities on an annual basis to maintain specified pricing based on volume purchasing during each calendar year 2011 through 2021. Actual purchases by BD in the future will be based on their demand, and therefore, may vary from period to period. The agreement will expire in January 2021 and can be extended. From time to time, we license the technology underlying the Orbos process to third parties. Revenues from these arrangements, however, are unpredictable. 
 Sales and Marketing
 We market and sell our products worldwide by maintaining direct sales forces and through independent distributors. We primarily sold our veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services in the United States through our direct sales force. Our sales force is primarily located in the United States. Abaxis Europe GmbH, our wholly-owned subsidiary in Germany, markets and distributes diagnostic systems for medical and veterinary uses in the European markets. Abaxis Asia, our wholly-owned subsidiary in Hong Kong, markets and distributes diagnostic systems for medical and veterinary uses in the Asia Pacific markets. Sales and marketing expenses were $45.2 million, $42.5 million and $42.1 million, or 20%, 19% and 21% of our total revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, Abaxis UK, our wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, distributes laboratory instrumentation and consumables to the veterinary profession in the United Kingdom. Abaxis UK was formed by our acquisition of Quality Clinical Reagents Limited and Trio Diagnostics (Ireland) Ltd in November 2014.

Manufacturing and Suppliers 
 We manufacture our Piccolo and VetScan blood chemistry instruments and the associated reagent discs at our facility located in Union City, California. We utilize standardized manufacturing processes, quality control and cost reduction and inventory management programs for our manufacturing operations. We continue to review our operations and facilities in an effort to reduce costs, increase manufacturing capacity and increase efficiencies. Our manufacturing activities are concentrated in the following three primary areas: 

• | Point-of-Care Blood Chemistry Instruments: Our Piccolo and VetScan systems employ a variety of components designed or specified by us, including a variable speed motor, microprocessors, a liquid crystal display, a printer, a spectrophotometer and other electronic components. These components are manufactured by several third-party suppliers that have been qualified and approved by us and then assembled by our contract manufacturers. The components are assembled at our facility into the finished product and completely tested to ensure that the finished product meets product specifications. Our blood analyzer products use several technologically-advanced components that we currently purchase from a limited number of suppliers, including certain components from our single-source supplier, Hamamatsu Corporation. Our analyzers also use a printer that is primarily made by Advanced Printing Systems.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reagent Discs: The molded plastic discs used in the manufacture of the reagent disc are manufactured to our specifications by established injection-molding manufacturers. To achieve the precision required for accurate test results, the discs must be molded to very strict tolerances. To date, we have qualified two injection-molding manufacturers, Balda C. Brewer, and Nypro, Inc., a subsidiary of Jabil Circuit, to make the molded plastic discs that, when loaded with reagents and welded together, form our reagent disc products. We assemble the reagent discs by loading the molded plastic discs with reagents and then ultrasonically welding together the top and bottom pieces.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reagent Beads and Reagents: Our reagent discs contain dry reagent chemistry beads and diluents to perform blood analyses. Lateral flow rapid tests contain reagents and diluents necessary to perform blood analyses. We purchase chemicals from third-party suppliers and formulate the raw materials, using proprietary processes, into beads at the proper concentration and consistency to facilitate placement in the reagent disc and provide homogeneous dissolution and mixing when contacted by the diluted sample. We are dependent on the following companies as single source providers of one or more chemicals that we use in the reagent production process: Amano Enzyme USA Co., Ltd., Kikkoman Corporation Biochemical Division, Microgenics Corporation, a division of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Roche Molecular Biochemicals of Roche Diagnostics Corporation, a division of F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd., SA Scientific Co., Sekisui Diagnostics, Sigma Aldrich Inc. and Toyobo Specialties.

 Although we believe that there may be potential alternate suppliers available for these critical components, to date we have not qualified additional vendors beyond those referenced above and cannot assure you that we would be able to enter into arrangements with additional vendors on favorable terms, or at all. We primarily operate on a purchase order basis with most of our suppliers and, therefore, these suppliers are under no contractual obligation to supply us with their products or to do so at specified prices. 
 In our veterinary market, we also market instruments and consumables that are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third parties to supply us with these specific products. These original manufacturer-supplied products are currently available from limited sources as discussed below. 
 
• | Hematology Instruments and Reagent Kits: Our VetScan hematology instruments are manufactured by Diatron in Hungary and are purchased by us as a completed instrument. In addition, we currently have qualified two suppliers to produce the reagent kits for our hematology instruments: Clinical Diagnostic Solutions, Inc. and Diatron.

• | Rapid Tests: Substantially all of our VetScan Rapid Tests are manufactured by a single source supplier, SA Scientific Co., located in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For the suppliers of original equipment manufactured products with which we have long-term contracts, there can be no assurance that these suppliers will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts, or that any suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products. In addition, under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts. 
 We generally operate with a limited order backlog because our products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received. As a result, product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter. 
 Competition
 Competition in the human medical and veterinary diagnostic markets is intense. The diagnostic market is a well-established field in which there are a number of competitors that have substantially greater financial resources and larger, more established marketing, sales and service organizations than we do. We compete primarily with the following organizations: commercial clinical laboratories, hospitals clinical laboratories and manufacturers of bench top multi-test blood analyzers and other testing systems that health care providers can use at the point of care. 
 Historically, hospitals and commercial laboratories perform most of the human diagnostic testing, and veterinary specialized commercial laboratories perform most of the veterinary medical testing. We have identified five principal factors that we believe customers typically use to evaluate our products and those of our competitors. These factors include the following: range of tests offered, immediacy of results, cost effectiveness, ease of use and reliability of results. We believe that we compete effectively on each of these factors except for the range of tests offered. Clinical laboratories are effective at processing large panels of tests using skilled technicians and complex equipment. Currently, while our offering of instruments and reagent discs does not provide the same broad range of tests as hospitals and commercial laboratories, we believe that in certain markets, our products provide a sufficient breadth of test menus to compete successfully with clinical laboratories given the advantages of our products with respect to the other four factors. 
 Our principal competitors in the point-of-care human medical diagnostic market are Alere Inc., Alfa Wassermann S.P.A., Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. Additionally, in certain segments of the human medical diagnostic market, we compete with Abbotts i-STAT division. Many of our competitors in the human medical diagnostic market have significantly larger product lines to offer and greater financial and other resources than we do. In particular, many of these competitors have large sales forces and well-established distribution channels and brand names. 
 Our principal competitors in the veterinary diagnostic market are Idexx Laboratories, Inc. and Heska Corporation. Idexx has a larger veterinary product and service offering than we do and a large sales infrastructure network and a well-established brand name. 
 Government Regulation 
 Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and foreign countries is a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of our current and future products and in our ongoing product research and development activities. We are not required to comply with all of the FDA government regulations applicable to the human medical market when manufacturing our VetScan products; however, we intend for all of our

  manufacturing operations to be compliant with the Quality System Regulation to help ensure product quality and integrity regardless of end use or patient. As we continue to sell in foreign markets, we may have to obtain additional governmental clearances in those markets. The government regulations for our medical and veterinary products vary. 
FDA Regulation of Human Medical Devices
 Our Piccolo products are in vitro diagnostic medical devices subject to regulation by the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Medical devices, to be commercially distributed in the United States, must receive either 510(k) premarket clearance or Premarket Approval (PMA) from the FDA prior to marketing. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either class I or II, which generally requires the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification requesting permission for commercial distribution; this is known as 510(k) clearance. Most lower risk, or class I, devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device or a preamendment class III device for which PMA applications have not been called, are placed in class III requiring PMA approval. The FDA has classified our Piccolo products as class I or class II devices, depending on their specific intended uses and indications for use.
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent in intended use, principles of operation, and technological characteristics to a previously 510(k) cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not called for submission of PMA applications. The FDAs 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to six months, but it can take longer. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval.
 As of March 31, 2017, we currently have received FDA premarket clearance for our Piccolo chemistry analyzer and 27 reagent tests that we have on 17 reagent discs. We are currently developing additional tests that we will have to clear with the FDA through the 510(k) notification process. The FDA may disagree with our assessment and require us to seek PMA approval or require us to meet significant postmarketing requirements. 
 Our Piccolo products are also subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). The current CLIA regulations divide laboratory tests into three categories: waived, moderately complex and highly complex. We currently offer Basic Metabolic Panel, Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, Electrolyte Panel, General Chemistry 6, General Chemistry 13, Kidney Check, Lipid Panel, Lipid Panel Plus, Liver Panel Plus, MetLyte 8 Panel and Renal Function Panel tests under waived status, which permits personnel not subject to CLIA imposed training requirements to run the Piccolo chemistry analyzer using these tests and thus allows for marketing to more sites (doctors offices and other point-of-care environments that maintain a CLIA certificate of waiver) than our other products that are subject to the other categories. For example, six of the panels performed using the Piccolo system are in the moderately complex category. This category requires that any location in which testing is performed be certified as a laboratory. Hence, we can only sell some Piccolo products to customers who meet the standards of a laboratory, which requires a testing facility to be certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and meet the CLIA regulations. As a result, the market for these non-waived products is more limited. 
 In March 2014, the FDA granted CLIA waived status for fingerstick draw for total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides blood tests. As a result, combined with existing CLIA waived tests for liver diagnostics and glucose using fingerstick samples, we now have two complete lipid panels that can be used by healthcare professionals to diagnose, treat and monitor hyperlipidemia patients using a sample obtained from either venous blood or a fingerstick draw. This enables U.S. healthcare professionals to perform lipid and liver diagnostics, as well as measure glucose levels with a simple fingerstick using the Piccolo chemistry analyzer.
 USDA Licensure of Veterinary Biologics
 Our rotor-based Canine Heartworm Antigen Test (CHW) and our lateral flow tests, including Canine Borrelia Burgdorferi Antibody Test Kit (rapid test for Lyme disease in dogs), Canine Ehrlichia Antibody Test Kit and Canine Anaplasma Test Kit, are regulated as veterinary biologics under the Virus, Serum, and Toxin Act of 1913. Both tests require licensure of both the product and manufacturing facilities. Biologics products are subject to

  more extensive testing to establish their purity, safety, potency, and efficacy and any failure to comply with the United States Department of Agricultures Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) licensure or post-marketing approval requirements can result in the inability to obtain and maintain required licenses for our products and there can be no assurances that our products can be maintained to the required quality levels necessary to continue to market these products. In addition, we are currently developing additional tests that will be subject to CVB licensure as veterinary biologics and licensure under CVB cannot be assured for these products.
Manufacturing and International Regulations
 The 1976 Medical Device Amendments also require us to manufacture our Piccolo products in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices guidelines. Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements are set forth in the FDAs Quality System Regulation. These requirements regulate the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for the design, manufacture, packaging, storage, installation and servicing of our medical devices intended for human use. Our manufacturing facility is subject to periodic inspections. In addition, various state regulatory agencies may regulate the manufacture of our products. 
 Federal, state, local and international regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of health care products and diagnostic devices may change. In addition, as we continue to sell in foreign markets, we may have to obtain additional governmental clearances in those markets. To date, we have complied with what we believe to be all applicable federal, state, local and international regulatory requirements and standards, including those of the FDA, USDA, State of California Food and Drug Branch and International Organization for Standardization for medical devices.
 Research and Development
 We are focused on the development of new products and on improvements to existing products. Research and development activities relate to development of new tests and test methods, clinical trials, product design and development, product improvements, optimization and enhancement of existing products and expenses related to regulatory and quality assurance. 
 Development of tests for point-of-care diagnostics will be targeted at specific applications based on fulfilling clinical needs. In September 2016, we completed the development of our connectivity product, the VetScan FUSE, which is currently in beta-testing. The VetScan FUSE is a web-based integration system that provides connectivity between our point-of-care diagnostic instruments and the veterinary practice management systems. During fiscal 2017, in the veterinary market, we also launched the following three reagent disc products, Electrolyte Plus, Preventative Care Profile Plus and Phenobarbital Panel, all of which are used in our VetScan chemistry analyzers. 
 As part of our product portfolio expansion strategies, during fiscal 2018, we expect to launch a new point-of-care urine sediment analyzer into the veterinary market, as well as a new point-of-care urine chemistry analyzer. Additionally, in fiscal 2018, we expect to launch the VetScan Canine Pancreatic Lipase Rapid Test, a rapid test for the detection of pancreas-specific lipase in canine serum or plasma. 
 Our research and development expenses, which consist of personnel costs, consulting expenses and materials and related expenses, were $19.8 million, $18.4 million and $16.3 million, or 9%, 8% and 8% of our total revenues, in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Research and development expense as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent over the same periods, reflecting our continued commitment to invest in long-term growth opportunities. 
 We anticipate that we will continue to make expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide new products to maintain and improve our competitive position. We will continue to develop new products that we believe will provide further opportunities for growth in the human medical and veterinary markets. 
 Patents, Proprietary Technologies and Licenses
 Our products sold in both the medical and veterinary markets are based on complex, rapidly-developing technologies. These technologies are covered by patents that we own. Our practice is to obtain patent protection on our products and processes where possible.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  We have pursued the development of a patent portfolio to protect our proprietary technology. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. As of March 31, 2017, 86 patent applications have been filed on our behalf with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, of which 47 patents have been issued and 19 patents are currently active. The expiration dates of our active patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office range from December 2017 to October 2034. In addition, we have 23 issued and active foreign patents and 65 foreign patent applications pending, of which one is a Patent Cooperation Treaty international application to be filed nationally in foreign countries. 
 We protect trade secrets, trademarks, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our success depends in part on obtaining patent protection for our products and processes, preserving trade secrets, patents and trademarks, operating without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, and acquiring licenses for technology or products.
 In the future, we may enter into license agreements or other arrangements with third parties relating to various aspects of our products as necessary. In the past, some of our existing products were manufactured or sold under the terms of license agreements that required us to pay royalties to the licensor based on the sales of products containing the licensed technology. From January 2009 to February 2015, we licensed co-exclusively certain worldwide patent rights related to lateral flow immunoassay technology in the field of animal health diagnostics in the professional marketplace from Alere. The license agreement enabled us to develop and market products under rights from Alere in the animal health and laboratory animal research markets. Effective February 2015, we terminated our license agreement with Alere as the licensed patents that we used had expired. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. 
 Employees
 As of March 31, 2017, we had 584 full-time employees. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
