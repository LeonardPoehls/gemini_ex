Competition
Our audio business faces strong competition in the consumer electronics market. Our primary competitor is Dolby Laboratories, which develops and markets, among other things, high‑definition audio products and services. Dolby’s long‑standing market position, brand, business relationships, resources and inclusion in various industry standards provide it with a strong competitive position.
In addition to Dolby, we compete in specific product markets with companies such as Fraunhofer IIS and various other consumer electronics product manufacturers. Many of these competitors have a wide variety of strengths that afford them competitive advantages, such as longer operating histories, greater resources, greater name recognition, or the ability to offer their technologies for a lower price or for free. We have historically competed effectively against these competitors due in part to our ability to position our brand as a premium offering that contains superior proprietary technology, the quality of our customer service, our inclusion in industry standards and our industry relationships.
Our HD Radio solution faces competition from subscription based digital service providers such as Sirius/XM, Pandora, Gracenote, and other digital audio and data service providers.
Our image processing technologies broadly compete with other image processing software vendors such as ArcSoft, Inc. as well as internal engineering and design groups of mobile phone and digital camera manufacturers that seek to provide similar technologies by employing different approaches. Over time, we expect to see new competitors and other competing technologies emerge.
Semiconductor and IP Licensing Segment
The Semiconductor and IP Licensing Segment licenses semiconductor packaging and interconnect technologies and related IP. These technology and IP assets are licensed primarily through our two subsidiaries Tessera and Invensas. Tessera’s research and development led to significant innovations in semiconductor packaging technology.  We patented these innovations, often referred to as chip-scale packaging, which have been widely adopted in the electronics industry. The wave of adoption was initially led by Intel Corporation, and over time, many semiconductor companies and outsourced assembly and test companies adopted the technology and entered into license agreements with Tessera, Inc.
Invensas Corporation develops next generation semiconductor packaging and interconnect technologies for memory, mobile, computing and automotive applications. For these applications, Invensas innovates in three primary areas: (i) DRAM and flash memory, (ii) mobile semiconductor devices, and (iii) three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D-IC) assemblies. Invensas engineering teams develop and prototype these technologies in advanced assembly and test laboratories, as well as performing full product reliability testing and acceptance testing. By building collaborative partnerships with world-class manufacturing companies and high-volume equipment and materials suppliers, Invensas then licenses these technology solutions to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), fabless device suppliers, foundries, outsourced assembly and test (OSATs) providers, and supports the technology transfer at customer-designated sites.
Within each of these three areas of innovation (memory, mobile, and 3D-IC), Invensas has created specific product solutions that address critical needs in the market.  For example, Invensas innovates in the 3D-IC space.  3D-IC, which includes Through-Silicon Vias, is widely expected to be the next major inflection in semiconductor packaging and is applicable to multiple markets, including networking, data storage, computing and mobility. In August of 2015, we augmented our 3D-IC portfolio with the acquisition of Ziptronix, Inc., a leading developer of emerging low temperature wafer bonding technologies, which are targeted at the image sensor, DRAM, MEMS, RF and 2.5D logic markets. Our ZiBond® technology is a low temperature homogenous (e.g. oxide-to-oxide) direct bonding solution that forms strong bonds between wafers or die with same or different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE). ZiBond offers multiple benefits over conventional bonding techniques such as adhesives, anodic bonding, eutectic bonding and glass frit. Bonding is performed at room temperature, which enhances overall yield and reliability, by eliminating the negative effects associated with coefficient of expansion (CTE) mismatch, 
8

warpage and distortion. Higher throughput and lower cost-of-ownership are realized by using industry-standard wafer alignment and bonding equipment. Our DBI® technology is a low temperature hybrid direct bonding solution that allows wafers or die to be bonded with exceptionally fine pitch 3D electrical interconnect. Like ZiBond, the DBI alignment and bonding process is performed at room temperature.  BDI leverages industry-standard wafer or die bonding equipment, enabling the high-throughput, low cost-of-ownership fabrication process required for high volume market applications. DBI can also minimize the need for Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) by allowing interconnection to occur at the bonding surface, thereby improving electrical performance. By incorporating dielectric bonding, DBI eliminates the need for under-fill while providing excellent thermal performance, reliability and hermeticity, if required.
Customers
Our semiconductor packaging and other technologies have been licensed to more than 100 companies. These customers include SK hynix, Micron and Broadcom, among others.
Research & Development
As demonstrated by our industry‑recognized, advanced and widely-deployed technologies, we have a long history of developing, licensing and delivering innovative semiconductor packaging and interconnect solutions. Many of our longstanding innovations have enabled core function and performance gains in semiconductor solutions over the years.
As we have grown, we continue to develop new technologies internally as well as seeking to acquire best-in-class technologies from outside sources. Taken together with a strong team of talented and deeply experienced research and development engineers, this base of technology and our constant efforts to innovate new, industry leading solutions, provides a strong foundation for the development of new and unique semiconductor packaging and interconnect solutions going forward.
Research and development and other related costs for the Semiconductor and Intellectual Property segment were approximately $30.0 million, $28.6 million and $22.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Intellectual Property Portfolio
As of December 31, 2017, our subsidiaries comprising the Semiconductor and IP Licensing segment owned approximately 1,877 United States patents and patent applications, as well as approximately 1,331 foreign patents and patent applications. The last of the issued patents to expire is in 2036.
From time to time, we acquire complementary IP portfolios from other leading companies in the semiconductor industry. Our criteria for patent acquisitions include: the fit with our existing portfolios, the number and jurisdiction of patent assets, the technical and legal strength of the patents, the actual or likely adoption by industry, and the economic value of the inventions. See Part I, Item 1A- Risk Factors.
Strategy
We are focused on the development of advanced packaging and interconnect technologies to enable the next generation of mobile, consumer, and computing products. Leveraging our extensive design, simulation and prototyping capability, we partner with leaders across the semiconductor ecosystem to develop and commercialize our technologies. As an integral component of our commercialization effort, we transfer our technologies to customer-selected manufacturing sites, foundries and OSATs.
Although we are engaged with and have successfully licensed and transferred our technologies to many semiconductor companies, some of the companies that use our patented technologies have nonetheless chosen not to enter a license agreement with us. Consequently, we have initiated litigation to enforce our IP rights. We view litigation as an instrument of last resort and we use it only when our efforts to reach negotiated licenses have stalled or failed. If we are unable to secure license agreements on favorable terms through negotiations, or if licensees do not comply with the terms of their licenses, we might have to file new litigation to enforce our rights. See Part 1, Item 3-Legal Proceedings.
Competition
We compete primarily with internal technology development groups at semiconductor manufacturers, assemblers, and electronic component and system manufacturers, who may create their own solutions that compete with technologies that we license. In general, there may be several ways to solve a particular technical problem and there can be no assurance that our 
9

inventions and approaches will be the ones generally adopted by the industry. We also compete with other firms in acquiring patent assets. The most significant impediment to our semiconductor and IP licensing business is the tendency for many companies to use our inventions and intellectual property without first obtaining a license from us.
