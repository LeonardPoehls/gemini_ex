Item 1.      Business
Overview 
 
Walker Innovation Inc. (formerly known as Patent Properties, Inc.), a Delaware corporation (collectively, with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or “Walker Innovation”), has two distinct lines of businesses: it develops and commercializes its unique portfolio of intellectual property assets through its licensing and enforcement operations (“Licensing and Enforcement”) and it focuses on helping companies innovate more effectively and efficiently (“Innovation Business”). The Company currently does this by seeking to provide custom innovation services to large companies desiring to prototype and scale new businesses and new business methods. In early 2015, it launched its small to mid-size innovation business through The United States Patent Utility™, which evolved into Haystack IQ™ (“Haystack IQ”) which used proprietary Big Data software to connect the global stockpile of technology improvements and technical experts, represented by the U.S. patent database and other technical databases, with businesses that can put them into commercial uses that help them compete and grow. On March 31, 2016, the Company ceased operations of its Haystack IQ product, and recorded a one-time non-recurring charge of approximately $575,000.
 
In response to the challenging developments in the patent licensing and enforcement environment, the decision to cease operations of Haystack IQ, and the expiration of our custom innovation agreement, our current plan of operations includes a more focused Licensing and Enforcement program, seeking new customers for our custom innovation services and the initiation of an effort to acquire, through merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, plan of arrangement, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination, one or more operating businesses, either within its current verticals or in new industry segments, or control of such operating businesses through contractual arrangements.
 
Walker Digital, LLC (“Walker Digital”), a related party, is the owner of 82% of the voting interest in the Company and owns approximately 49% of the economic interest in the Company.
 
The Company is led by entrepreneur and inventor Jay Walker, who is best known as the founder of Priceline.com and has twice been named by TIME magazine as “one of the top 50 business leaders of the digital age.” Mr. Walker currently ranks as the world’s 10th most patented living individual, based on U.S. patent issuances according to Wikipedia.

Option Repricing
 
On January 12, 2017, the compensation committee of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors and a stockholder of Walker Innovation entitled to vote 2,358,500 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 (“Common Stock”) and 14,999,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, representing, collectively, approximately 82.3% of the outstanding voting stock of the Company entitled to vote on such date with respect to such corporate actions, approved a one-time stock Option Repricing program (the “Option Repricing”) to permit the Company to reprice certain options to purchase the Company’s Common Stock held by its current directors, officers and employees (the “Eligible Options”), which actions will become effective on the twentieth calendar day following the mailing to the Company’s stockholders of the definitive Information Statement on Schedule 14C filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which effectiveness date is currently expected to be February 19, 2017. Under the Option Repricing, as of the date the Option Repricing becomes effective, Eligible Options with an exercise price at or above $1.37 per share (expected to represent an aggregate of 2,743,000 options, or 58% of the total outstanding) will be amended to reduce such exercise price to the average daily volume weighted average closing price of the Common Stock on the OTCQB for the 20 trading day period immediately following such effective date or, if greater, the closing price of a share of the Company’s Common Stock, as reported by the OTCQB on the business day immediately prior thereto (currently expected to be February 17, 2017).
 
The Company will record the impact of the repricing (which will be a charge to operations over the remaining term of the options) in the first quarter of 2017. The charge is non cash and equity neutral and in the opinion of management will have no material impact on the operating activities of the Company.
 
Related Party Transactions
 
On November 28, 2016, the Company entered into a Release and Settlement Agreement with Walker Digital (the “Settlement Agreement”) relating to rights to indemnification from Walker Digital as a consequence of the settlement with a third party arising from such third party’s claims against Walker Digital related to certain patent families the Company received by recorded assignment from Walker Digital at the time of its formation in 2013. The terms of the Settlement Agreement were approved by the Audit Committee of the Company at a meeting held on November 21, 2016. The Settlement Agreement requires Walker Digital to pay the Company $125,000 in cash, or return to the Company shares of its common stock having a value of $125,000 within six months following the date of the Settlement Agreement and acknowledges the direct and indirect benefits received by the Company from Walker Digital in connection with the November Purchase Agreement as part of the consideration received in connection with the release of the Company’s indemnification claims against Walker Digital.
Business
 
The Company’s two primary segments of business, its Licensing and Enforcement business, and its Innovation Business, are described below:
 
Licensing and Enforcement
 
The Company seeks to develop, license and otherwise enforce patented technologies through its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company generates revenues from the granting of intellectual property rights for the use of, or pertaining to, its patented technologies. The Company may also monetize its intellectual property through the sale and/or licensing of select patent assets. Patent protection is a key part of the Company’s business model, because it provides the Company with a period of exclusive ownership during which the Company has the opportunity to recoup risk capital and generate a profit from inventions. The Company has one ongoing patent licensing and enforcement campaign involving a specific family of patents.
 
All of our intellectual property assets were created with the goal of solving business problems, with the intent to achieve commercial status. However, it is our belief that certain of our inventions have become part of the commercial activities of other businesses without having been licensed, depriving us of financial value. As a result, focused patent enforcement and licensing activities are a component of our business strategy. During the past three fiscal years the Company has filed 12 patent infringement lawsuits  (including three counterclaims in declaratory judgment actions) involving 7 different patents. These enforcement efforts, along with enforcement and licensing efforts involving previously filed cases have resulted in over $6.3 million in gross revenue from settlement income since January, 2014. There are currently 2 litigation matters pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. We continue to investigate other infringers and may expand enforcement activities to other unlicensed users of previously asserted patents. Our litigation matters are disclosed below under Item 3 –Legal Proceedings.

Intellectual Property/Patent Portfolio Overview
 
Our patent portfolio currently consists of approximately 300 US issued patents, as well as 15 pending patent applications and certain foreign counterpart patents and applications. Our patents describe inventions in areas such as authentication techniques, internet search, social networking and advertising and online transactions, among many others. They are relevant to a broad array of large and growing industries including data management, e-commerce, electronic and computer hardware, social networking and internet services, financial services, entertainment and video gaming, online education, manufacturing, security and state lotteries.
 
Furthermore, to optimize the quality of our intellectual property, we retain well-qualified patent attorneys to work on every stage of the patent procurement process, from ideation, through drafting, prosecution and appeals. Potentially, there may be valuable unasserted claims within the portfolio. We may file for additional patent protection based on some of our existing patents and patent applications when appropriate. In addition, all of our employees enter into confidentiality agreements with us, which includes a provision governing the assignment of inventions.
 
Competition
 
With respect to our Licensing and Enforcement operations, we expect to encounter competition from others seeking to license or sell intellectual property. This includes an increase in the number of competitors seeking to license or sell similar patents and technologies. Other companies may develop competing technologies and offerings that may provide better or less expensive alternatives to our patented technologies that we may license or sell. Many potential competitors may have significantly greater resources than we do. Technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors could render certain of the technologies owned and services to be provided obsolete and/or uneconomical. 
Innovation Business
 
The Company focuses on helping companies innovate more effectively and efficiently. The Company seeks to accomplish this by offering custom innovation services to large companies. Prior to March 31, 2016, the Company also had a product for small and medium businesses called “Haystack IQ”, however, as more fully described below the Company ceased operations of Haystack IQ at the end of the first quarter of 2016 and recorded a one-time non-recurring charge of $575,000.
 
Haystack IQ
 
Haystack IQ™ was a product that helped companies find complementary external resources in the global “haystack” of R&D investment that could accelerate improvements to their customer offerings and evolved out of The United States Patent Utility™. Haystack IQ was shut down at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
 
Custom Innovation
 
The Company seeks to provide consulting services and software development to large companies in connection with prototyping projects as well as the development of new and innovative ways to serve their customers and grow their market share. The Company may be engaged by the customer directly, or work may be subcontracted to it by its controlling stockholder, a related party, Walker Digital.
 
During 2016 the Company performed custom innovation services for Walker Digital, pursuant to a work order for a prototype project involving a Fortune 500 insurance company that previously retained Walker Digital to design and develop viable new business models. The business prototype to be developed had an approved budget of approximately $3.0 million that was funded through late 2016. With the expiration of its current work order, the Company is looking to identify one or more new custom innovation customers.
 
Initiation of Acquisition Efforts
 
Aided by the capital proceeds received under the Purchase Agreements (described above), the Company has initiated efforts to acquire, through merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, plan of arrangement, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination, one or more operating businesses, either within its current verticals or in new industry segments, or control of such operating businesses through contractual arrangements. There can be no assurance the Company’s efforts in this regard will be successful.

Corporate History 
 
In 2010, we sold our four previous operating units and determined that, following those transactions, we were a “shell company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As a result of the Merger described below, we ceased to be a shell company.
 
In connection with an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July 11, 2013, Walker Holdings was formed as a limited liability company in the State of Delaware on June 3, 2013. Immediately prior to the closing of the related merger (the “Merger”) on September 18, 2013 (the “Closing Date”), Walker Digital, then the sole member of Walker Holdings, contributed Walker Licensing, a segment of Walker Digital, to Walker Holdings. Upon the closing of the Merger, our newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary merged with and into Walker Holdings, and Walker Holdings became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Immediately following the Merger, the business of Walker Holdings became the business of the Company. Subsequent to the Closing Date, Walker Holdings changed its name to Inventor Holdings, LLC (“IH LLC”). On July 31, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation with the State of Delaware, pursuant to which the Company was renamed Walker Innovation Inc. 
 
All of the patents we own through IH LLC f/k/a Walker Holdings were developed internally by Walker Digital, with Jay Walker as the lead inventor named on almost all patents issued. All improvements to these assets, together with the intellectual property associated with The United States Patent Utility, the predecessor to Haystack IQ, have been assigned pursuant to an Invention Assignment Agreement with Mr. Walker. While the terms of the Invention Assignment Agreement do not entitle us to any other intellectual property Mr. Walker may develop in the future, in view of his significant equity position in the Company and the Company’s platform for the protection of the intellectual property it holds, Mr. Walker may nevertheless determine to develop and commercialize intellectual property through the Company. The terms and conditions of any such transaction would be negotiated between Mr. Walker and our Audit Committee at the time of such determination.
 
Employees
 
As of February 7, 2017, we have 5 full-time employees and one part-time employee. In addition, although he is not an employee, Mr. Walker has and will continue to devote a portion of his working effort to us. Any future hiring decisions will be on an as-needed basis. At this time we believe our staffing is sufficient for our current operations.
Executive Officers of Our Company
 
Jonathan Siegel, formerly the Company’s President, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary, was elected by the Board as Chief Executive Officer on February 3, 2017. Mr. Siegel brings to the position a knowledge of existing operations, particularly Licensing and Enforcement, and experience as a corporate attorney, which can facilitate the Company’s acquisition efforts. Jonathan Ellenthal, Mr. Siegel’s predecessor, who resigned as Chief Executive Officer on February 3, 2017, will continue to serve the Company as Vice Chairman and as a member of the Executive Committee of the Board. Mr. Ellenthal intends to focus his professional efforts on the launch and development of Upside, in which the Company holds the Upside Warrant.
