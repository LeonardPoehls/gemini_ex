Item 1. Business 
 Organization. Tidelands Royalty Trust B (the Trust) is a royalty trust that was created on June 1, 1954 under the laws of the State of Texas. The Trust is not permitted to engage in any business activity because it was organized for the sole purpose of providing an efficient, orderly and practical means for the administration and liquidation of rights to interests in certain oil, natural gas or other mineral leases obtained by Gulf Oil Corporation (Gulf) in a designated area of the Gulf of Mexico. These rights are evidenced by a contract between the Trusts predecessors and Gulf dated April 30, 1951 (the 1951 Contract), which is binding upon the assignees of Gulf. As a result of various transactions that have occurred since 1951, the Gulf interests that were subject to the 1951 Contract now are held by Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (Chevron), which is a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, and its respective assignees. 
 The Tidelands Royalty Trust B Indenture, effective June 1, 1954, as amended (the Indenture), provides that the corporate trustee is to distribute all cash in the Trust, excluding cash retained by its subsidiary, less an amount reserved for the payment of accrued liabilities and estimated future expenses, to unitholders of record on the last business day of March, June, September and December of each year. Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, all distributions will be sent within 15 calendar days of the record date. The Indenture prohibits the operation of any kind of trade or business by the Trust. 
 The Indenture provides that the term of the Trust will expire on April 30, 2021, unless extended by the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding units of beneficial interest. 
 Effective October 19, 2017, Simmons First National Corporation (SFNC) completed its acquisition of First Texas BHC, Inc., the parent company of Southwest Bank. SFNC is the parent of Simmons Bank. SFNC merged Southwest Bank, the former corporate Trustee of the Trust, with Simmons Bank effective February 20, 2018. The defined term Trustee as used herein shall refer to Southwest Bank for periods from May 30, 2014 through February 19, 2018 and to Simmons Bank for periods on and after February 20, 2018. 
 The Trusts wholly-owned subsidiary, Tidelands Royalty B Corporation (Tidelands Corporation, collectively with the Trust, Tidelands), holds title to interests in properties subject to the 1951 Contract that are situated offshore of Louisiana. Ninety-five percent of all oil, natural gas and other mineral royalties collected by Tidelands Corporation, less the cost of receiving and collecting, are retained by and delivered to the Trust. Tidelands Corporation retains the remaining 5% of the overriding royalties along with other items of income and expense until such time as the board of directors declares a dividend out of retained earnings. Tidelands Corporation, like the Trust, is prohibited from engaging in a trade or business and does only those things necessary for the administration and liquidation of its properties. 
 Tidelands only industry segment or purpose is the administration and collection of royalties. 
 The 1951 Contract. The 1951 Contract identifies 60 specific tracts (the Tracts) in the Gulf of Mexico. The Tracts are not all the same size and collectively contain approximately 1,370,000 acres. Prior to the expiration of the 50-year lease acquisition period on April 30, 2001 (the Acquisition Expiration Date), if Chevron or its assignees had acquired a lease or leases on one of the Tracts, and if oil or natural gas were produced and sold from any such Tract, then Chevron or its assignees had to make production payments to Tidelands, in an amount equal to approximately 12.5% of the value at the wellhead of the oil and natural gas subject to such lease until the sum of $1,500,000 was paid to Tidelands under the lease. The $1,500,000 production payment was paid on five leases. Thereafter, Tidelands interest in such Tracts converted to an overriding royalty as described below. As described below, five of the Tracts had leases and rights to the other 55 Tracts expired at the Acquisition Expiration Date. One of the five leases (on Galveston Area Block 303) terminated in 2012 due to lack of production from the wells on the lease.

As of March 1, 2018, Tidelands had an overriding royalty interest in four oil and natural gas leases covering 17,188 gross acres in the Gulf of Mexico in the Sabine Pass and West Cameron areas (collectively, the Royalty Area). As of March 1, 2018, all four of Tidelands assigned leases contained active wells. Tidelands overriding royalty interest on three of the four current leases is 4.1662%. On the fourth lease, the overriding royalty interest is 1.0416%. The overriding royalty interest on the fourth lease is lower because Chevron only acquired a 25% working interest in the lease. 
 Since the Acquisition Expiration Date has passed, Chevron and its assignees are no longer obligated to assign any interest to Tidelands out of any lease that they acquire on any of the Tracts. Tidelands will continue to be entitled to receive payments on four of the leases Chevron or its assignees acquired prior to the Acquisition Expiration Date, so long as such leases are active properties. The four leases in which Tidelands had an overriding royalty interest during 2017 are identified in the table below:

 In 2017, royalty income from the sale of oil represented 61% of Tidelands total royalty income and royalty income from the sale of natural gas represented 39% of Tidelands total royalty income. The production payments and royalty income received by Tidelands are affected by the producing capability of the wells, seasonal fluctuations in demand and changes in the market prices for oil and natural gas. 
 The following table presents the approximate percentage of royalties actually received from each royalty payor for the past three years: 
 

Royalty Payors (1) | 2017 | | | 2016 | | 2015
Renaissance Offshore LLC | | 90 | % | | 69 | % | 60 | %
Fieldwood Energy LLC | | 10 | % | | 30 | % | 38 | %
EnVen Energy Ventures, LLC (2) | |  | % | | 1 | % | 2 | %

(1) | W&T Offshore, Inc. has paid royalties for its 75.00% working interest on Galveston Block 303. Since January 2010, Sterling Energy, Inc. and Barron Petroleum Company, who collectively own the remaining 25.00% of the working interest, have not paid royalties to Tidelands pending an agreement on which

working interest owner is responsible for making payments. As of May 30, 2012, the lease on Galveston Block 303 was terminated. Tidelands has not determined which party is responsible for these payments. Tidelands estimates that the royalties due from Sterling Energy, Inc. and Barron Petroleum Company would have totaled approximately $85,887 for 2010, 2011 and 2012. As of March 1, 2018, the Trustee has not been able to successfully collect these funds.

(2) | EnVen Energy Ventures LLC is not a working interest owner of record but pays the royalties due to Tidelands from West Cameron Block 225. Production ceased on West Cameron Block 225 in July 2012 but went back on stream in September 2013. A suspension of production was granted through February 2013.

 Tidelands derives no revenues from foreign sources and has no export sales. 
 Trust Functions. The Trust is administered by officers and employees of the Trustee. The Trust has no employees. See Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance. 
 All aspects of Tidelands operations are conducted by third parties. These operations include the production and sale of oil and natural gas and the calculation of royalty payments to Tidelands, which are conducted by oil and natural gas companies that lease Tracts subject to Tidelands interests. American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC is the transfer agent for Tidelands and is responsible for reviewing, processing and paying distributions. 
 The ability of Tidelands to receive revenues is entirely dependent upon its entitlement to its rights with respect to the four leases held by Chevron and its assignees in the Gulf of Mexico (as more fully described in Item 2. Properties below). 
 The royalty interests held by Tidelands are depleting with each barrel (bbl) of oil and thousand cubic feet (mcf) of natural gas produced. No funds are reinvested by Tidelands; thus, these depleting assets are not being replaced. 
 Widely Held Fixed Investment Trust Reporting Information. The Trustee assumes that some units of beneficial interest are held by middlemen, as such term is broadly defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations (and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners, and brokers holding an interest for a customer in street name). Therefore, the Trustee considers the Trust to be a widely held fixed investment trust (WHFIT) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Trust will provide tax information in accordance with applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a WHFIT. The representative of the Trust that will provide the required information is the Trustee, and the contact information for the representative is as follows: 
Simmons Bank
