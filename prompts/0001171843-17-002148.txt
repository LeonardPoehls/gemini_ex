ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Amyris, Inc. (or the "Company," "Amyris," "we," "us," or "our") is a leading integrated industrial biotechnology company that is applying its technology platform to engineer, manufacture and sell high performance, low cost products into the Health and Nutrition, Personal Care and Performance Materials markets. Our proven technology platform allows us to rapidly engineer microbes and use them as catalysts to metabolize renewable, plant-sourced sugars into large volume, high-value ingredients. Our biotechnology platform and industrial fermentation process replaces existing complex and expensive chemical manufacturing processes. We believe industrial synthetic biology represents a third industrial revolution, bringing together biology and engineering to generate new, more sustainable materials to meet the growing global demand for bio-based replacements for petroleum, animal- or plant-derived ingredients. We continue to build demand for our current portfolio of products through a sales network comprised of direct sales and distributors, and are engaged in collaborations across each of our three market focus areas to drive additional product sales and partnership opportunities. Via our partnership model, we co-invest in the development of each molecule to bring it from the lab to commercial scale and then capture long term revenue either via the sale of the molecule to the partner and/or value sharing of end product sales.
Background
 
Amyris was founded in 2003 in the San Francisco Bay Area by a group of scientists from the University of California, Berkeley. Our first major milestone came in 2005 when, through a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we developed technology capable of creating microbial strains that produce artemisinic acid - a precursor of artemisinin, an effective anti-malarial drug. In 2008, we granted royalty-free licenses to allow Sanofi-Aventis (Sanofi) to produce artemisinic acid using our technology. Building on our success with artemisinic acid, in 2007 we began applying our technology platform to develop, manufacture and sell sustainable alternatives to a broad range of markets.
 
We focused our initial development efforts primarily on the production of Biofene®, our brand of renewable farnesene, a long-chain, branched hydrocarbon molecule that we manufacture through fermentation using engineered microbes. Our farnesene derivatives are sold in hundreds of products as nutraceuticals, skin care, fragrances, solvents, polymers, and lubricants ingredients. The commercialization of farnesene pushed us to create a more cost efficient, faster and accurate development process in the lab and drive costs out of our Brotas, Brazil production facility. This investment has enabled our technology platform to rapidly develop microbial strains and commercialize target molecules. In 2014, we began manufacturing additional molecules for the flavors and fragrance (F&F) industry, in 2015 we began investing to expand our capabilities to other small molecule chemical classes beyond terpenes via our collaboration with the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), as discussed below, and in 2016 we expanded into proteins.
 
Since inception, we have received equity and debt financing from investors including affiliates of Total S.A. (collectively referred to as Total), the international energy company, and affiliates of Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund (collectively referred to as Temasek), and various venture capital and private equity investors. Our common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol AMRS.

Our Platform
 
Amyris has invested over $500 million in infrastructure and technology to create microbes that produce chemicals from sugar or other feedstocks at commercial scale. This platform has been used to design, build, optimize, and upscale strains producing 5 distinct molecules, leading to more than 15 commercial products used in 500 consumer products. Our time to market for molecules has decreased from 7 years to less than a year for our most recent molecule, mainly due to our ability to leverage the technology platform we have built.
 
Our technology platform has been in active use since 2008, and has been integrated with our commercial production since 2011, creating a seamless organism development process that we believe makes Amyris an industry leader in the successful scale-up of small molecules. The key performance characteristics of our platform that we believe differentiate Amyris include our proprietary computational tools, strain construction tools, screening and analytics tools, and advanced lab automation and data integration. Our state-of-the-art infrastructure includes industry leading strain engineering and lab automation located in Emeryville, CA, pilot scale production facilities in Emeryville, CA and Campinas, Brazil, a demonstration scale facility in Campinas, Brazil and a commercial scale production facility in Brotas, Brazil.
 
We are able to use a wide variety of feedstocks for production, but have focused on accessing Brazilian sugarcane for our large-scale production because of its renewability, low cost and relative price stability. We have also successfully used other feedstocks such as sugar beets, corn dextrose, sweet sorghum and cellulosic sugars at various manufacturing facilities.
 
We are currently producing three molecules at our Brotas, Brazil plant: farnesene and two fragrance molecules.


Corporate Information
 
We were founded in 2003 and completed our initial public offering in 2010. As of January 31, 2017, we had 440 full-time employees (including 280 in the United States and 160 in Brazil). Our corporate headquarters and pilot plant are located in Emeryville, California, and our Brazil headquarters and pilot plant are located in Campinas, Brazil. We have one operating subsidiary, Amyris Brasil Ltda. (Amyris Brasil) which oversees establishment and expansion of our production operations in Brazil.
Strategy and Business Model
 
Our mission is to apply innovative science to deliver sustainable solutions for a growing world. We seek to become the world's leading provider of renewable, high-performance alternatives to non-renewable and scarce products. In the past, choosing a renewable product often required producers to compromise on performance or price. With our technology, leading consumer brands can develop products made from renewable sources that offer equivalent or better performance and stable supply with competitive pricing. We call this our No Compromise® value proposition. We aim to improve the world one molecule at a time by providing the best alternatives to the products the world relies on every day.
 
We have developed and are operating our company under a business model that generates cash from collaborations, from product sales, and value share. We believe this combination will enable us to realize our vision of becoming the world’s leading renewable products company.

Collaborations
 
Collaborations provide us with funding to develop the solutions partners are looking for to gain a competitive advantage either through a lower cost, more reliable supply source or through access to a needed scarce ingredient. This results in our partners gaining a competitive performance and economic advantage while Amyris is able to further build upon our leading technology platform and gain access to upfront funding as well as a long-term revenue stream. These collaborative technology-based partnerships typically range from two to five years and have funded a substantial portion of our direct research and development expenses since 2012. These relationships have also provided us with a robust pipeline of molecules from which we expect to launch production of three to four products annually at our industrial scale facility in Brotas, Brazil. Our collaborations generate value in several ways, including:

• | helping us identify and develop molecules that address critical supply or performance needs for our partners, while receiving collaboration payments for technology access and research and development;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | minimizing risk of product market entry and optimizing our resource prioritization; 


• | using our integrated manufacturing capabilities to produce and sell collaboration target molecules to our partners;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | participating in additional value-sharing arrangements based on the cost/benefits to our partners of using the molecules we develop; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | providing opportunities to develop products for markets outside the partner agreements from the research insights gained and intellectual property obtained during the development process.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe this collaboration-based business model creates long-term relationships with aligned incentives for success, and allows us to access a portion of the capital and resources necessary to support large-scale production and global distribution of our products.
 
Product Sales
 
In addition to our collaborations (including product sales to and value sharing arrangements with our collaboration partners as described above), we have been developing, manufacturing and selling high-value farnesene derivatives that are branded as our Neossance® emollients for the cosmetics industry, and our BiossanceTM direct to consumer beauty brand. Both brands are based on our farnesene derivative, squalane. The Neossance brand is focused on business to business sales and is sold via our distributor network in order to accelerate commercialization. Selling squalane as a branded product has enabled us to differentiate ourselves from the other squalane sources available on the market which are either detrimental to the environment or of lower quality and subject to severe supply and pricing fluctuations. Since its launch in 2011, we have achieved worldwide reach for our Neossance emollients, with our initial high-performance emollient (Neossance squalane) serving as a key ingredient in personal care products for a growing list of cosmetics companies. In December 2016, we formed a joint venture for our Neossance business with Nikko Chemicals Co., Ltd. and Nippon Surfactant Industries Co., Ltd. (collectively referred to as Nikko), in which we hold a 50% interest. See below under “Business-Joint Ventures” for more information regarding our Neossance joint venture.

In 2015, we launched our direct to consumer beauty brand, Biossance. The brand was initially developed to capture a greater value share of the direct to consumer beauty brand market versus only selling squalane into this market as an ingredient. The first Biossance product launched, The Revitalizer, is made exclusively from Neossance squalane. Biossance products were initially sold solely through our ecommerce branded website and in 2016 we expanded the product line to include an expansive line of high-performance skin care products and began sales through the Home Shopping Network (HSN). In October 2016, we announced that our Biossance product line would begin to be carried at Sephora in 2017. In February 2017, we launched a full squalane based consumer cosmetic line at participating Sephora stores and Sephora online. All of the products are based on Amyris’s commitment to No CompromiseTM. Since the launch, sales have grown, and with Sephora’s partnership, we are looking to expand to more stores.
 
Via our collaboration partnership model, we also have several products we manufacture and sell to our partners in the F&F and Performance Materials industries. In 2014 we established sales of F&F ingredients to a collaboration partner, representing our first major product sales of a molecule other than farnesene and, in 2015, we established sales of a second F&F molecule.
 
With partners such as Kuraray Co., Ltd. (Kuraray) and Novvi LLC (Novvi), our joint-venture with Cosan US. Inc. (Cosan US and, together with its affiliates, Cosan), American Refining Group, Inc. (ARG) and Chevron Products Company, a division of Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (Chevron) we sell farnesene for the manufacture of performance materials such as polymers, lubricants and specialty adhesives. Kuraray uses our farnesene to produce liquid farnesene rubber, a highly effective tire additive with superior snow, ice and wet-grip properties. We also produce and sell a farnesene derivative, Myralene®, a solvent with very good cleaning, worker health and environmental benefits. We continue to produce and sell renewable diesel for niche markets in Brazil, and renewable jet fuel for early adoption of such jet fuel in specific routes selected by participating airlines. Though these products have not yet generated material net cash contributions to our business, we have maintained such sales as part of our industrial-scale manufacturing offtake and to support our ongoing development efforts toward a commercially-viable Biofene-based renewable fuel in collaboration with Total.


Manufacturing
 
We began industrial-scale production of our products at contract manufacturing facilities in 2011 and, in December 2012, commenced operations at our first purpose-built, large-scale production facility in southeastern Brazil. This multi-product production facility, located in Brotas, in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, is adjacent to an existing sugar and ethanol mill operated by Tonon Bioenergia SA (Tonon), formerly known as Paraíso Bioenergia. Through 2016, we produced farnesene and two ingredients for the F&F industry at commercial scale at such facility. Under our manufacturing agreement, Tonon supplies sugarcane syrup and certain utilities. Amyris is solely responsible for maintenance and operation of our plant. Our Brotas facility has six 200,000 liter production fermenters and was designed to process sugarcane juice and syrup, or their equivalent, from up to one million tons of raw sugarcane annually. In December 2012, we began production of farnesene at this facility. Our first shipment of farnesene produced at the Brotas facility occurred in February 2013, and our first shipment of a fragrance molecule from the facility occurred in August 2014. We began manufacturing our second fragrance molecule at the Brotas facility in September 2015 and commenced shipping the product in December 2015, with volume ramp up in 2016. In 2016, we made the first large scale shipments of Biofene to our partner who successfully produced and sold a high-value nutraceutical product to their customers. In February 2017, we broke ground on a second purpose-built, large-scale production facility adjacent to our current Brotas facility.

For many of our products, we perform additional distillation or chemical finishing steps to convert initial target molecules into other finished products, such as renewable squalane, F&F ingredients, lubricants, performance polymers and diesel. We have agreements with several facilities in the U.S. and Brazil to perform distillation, filtration, purification and hydrogenation steps for such products. We may enter into additional agreements with other facilities for finishing services and to access flexible capacity and an array of services as we develop additional products. In December 2016, we purchased a facility in Leland, North Carolina, which had been previously operated by Glycotech Inc. (Glycotech) to convert our Biofene into squalane and other final products. We subsequently contributed that facility to our Neossance joint venture discuss above. See below under “Business-Joint Ventures” for more information regarding our Neossance joint venture.
 
Technology
 
Synthetic biology uses engineering concepts to leverage the power of biology. We have developed innovative microbial engineering and screening technologies that allow us to transform the way microbes metabolize sugars. Specifically, we engineer microbes, such as yeast, and use them as catalysts to convert sugar, through fermentation, into high-value molecules. In 2015, we were awarded a DARPA investment to expand the capabilities of our technology platform beyond terpenoids. The investment has resulted in us developing an integrated platform with artificial intelligence that will speed up the development and commercialization of small molecules across 15 different chemical classes. In 2016, we entered into a partnership with Biogen. Inc. (Biogen) that is utilizing our strain engineering toolbox to develop and produce recombinant proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies, for pharmaceutical use.
 
Together with our collaboration partners, we use these molecules as building blocks for a wide range of products in our target markets. This is our foundation for providing high-performance, cost competitive and sustainable alternatives to a wide variety of markets.


Research and Development
 
Our ongoing technology development is focused primarily on developing microbial strains that produce targeted molecules and on improving the performance of our production microbial strains. As described in more detail below, our process consists of a series of steps including:

• | identifying new target molecules;
--+----------------------------------


• | creating new microbial strains capable of producing the target molecules;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increasing product yield and productivity from microbial strains through strain modification or fermentation process improvements; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | translating these steps from lab to commercial scale production consistently.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We devote substantial resources to our research and development efforts. As of January 31, 2017, our research and development organization included approximately 147 employees, 45 of whom held Ph.D.s. Our research and development expenditures were approximately $51.4 million, $44.6 million, and $49.7 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
Strain Engineering and Scale-Up Process
 
The primary biological pathway within the microbe that we currently use to produce our commercial molecules is called the isoprenoid or terpenoid pathway. Isoprenoids constitute a large, diverse class of as many as 40,000 identified organic chemicals produced by this pathway in nature, with current product applications in a wide range of industries. Implementing the classical engineering cycle of “Design-Build-Test-Learn” with investments of more than $500 million to date for research and development, we have reduced strain engineering time to produce target isoprenoid molecules from years to months, opening up the possibility of quickly producing thousands of different target molecules from fermentation. Our platform has also allowed us to expand beyond terpenoids to other small molecule chemical classes and proteins.
 
We have developed a high-throughput strain engineering system that is currently capable of producing and screening more than 100,000 yeast strains per month, which allows us to achieve approximately a 95% lower cost per strain than we achieved in 2009. We generated more than 500,000 unique strains in 2016, surpassing 5.0 million unique strains created since our inception, with each strain testing for improved production of the target molecules. In addition, through our lab-scale and pilot-plant fermentation operations, and our proprietary analytical tools, we are now able to predict, with high reliability, the industrial performance of candidate strains in our 200,000-liter fermenters at our Brotas plant.
 
The following summarizes the key steps in our strain engineering and scale-up processes:
 

1. | Identifying target molecules. We start our process by identifying, usually based on input from collaborators, a commercial application for which we can deliver an attractive No Compromise® solution. We identify the key molecular properties that are essential to product performance in a specific commercial application and then analyze the chemical structures that drive those key performance characteristics. Finally, we identify target molecules or derivatives of molecules that contain these key chemical structures and that may be cost-effectively produced by our yeast strains.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Developing initial strains/proof of concept. We identify the enzyme-catalyzed chemical conversion steps required for the target molecule's production in a biological pathway. We then seek to design a pathway to produce the target molecule, either directly or by producing a molecule that can, through simple chemical steps, be synthesized, or converted, into the target. Once this pathway is identified, we undertake to engineer it into our yeast strains by employing the processes discussed below.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Improving strain performance and process development. To produce the target molecules at industrial scale in a cost-effective manner, a yeast strain must be improved to increase its level of efficiency of production. Initially, we focus primarily on yield, a measure of the amount of product produced from feeding the microbe a defined amount of sugar. As we advance in our scale-up and commercial scale process development, we also seek to improve production output through improvements in strain productivity, the rate at which our product is produced by a given strain, and titer, the concentration of product in the fermentation broth. In addition, we seek to develop processes to improve production cost and recovery efficiency, including optimizing cycle-time, which is the time needed to run a full fermentation cycle, fermentation process optimization to minimize cost, and separation efficiency, a measure of the amount of product that is recovered from a fermentation run. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. | Moving production from lab to commercial scale. Once we have established a pathway and verified that it can produce the target molecule, the yeast strain must be improved to increase the level of efficiency of production, and tested for performance in larger-volume facilities, before it is implemented at our larger-scale manufacturing facilities. Our infrastructure to support this scale-up process includes lab-scale fermenters (0.5 to 2 liter), operating pilot plants in our facilities in Emeryville, California and Campinas, Brazil (300 liters), and one 5,000-liter fermenters in our Campinas demonstration facility. Each of these stages mimic the conditions found in larger scale fermentation so that our findings may translate predictably from lab scale to pilot and ultimately to commercial scale.

Products
 
We are expanding our range of products with our partners as well as with Amyris branded products. Our partner products are divided into three market areas: Health and Nutrition, Personal Care and Performance Materials. Independently, we have formulated end-user products such as our Biossance™ brand skin care products and products that are based on Biofene and Biofene derivatives that we sell into several markets.
Health and Nutrition
 
The Health and Nutrition markets include our pharmaceutical work in aiding new drug development and developing alternative cell lines to mammalian cell cultures, nutraceuticals, such as vitamins, and food ingredients. This is a fairly new area for Amyris and most of our work in these areas is still under development and have not been commercialized yet.
 
During 2016, we announced the signings of our first ingredient supply agreement and collaboration agreement for the global nutraceuticals market. Under the supply agreement, we source Biofene to our partner, which is then further processed into a nutraceutical product. In 2016, we made the first large scale shipments of Biofene to our partner, who successfully produced and sold a nutraceutical product to its customers. The availability of large volumes of Biofene as starting material enables a significant reduction in the production time, complexity and cost of producing end-use nutraceutical products. Under the collaboration agreement, we are working to create and develop additional nutraceutical compounds and, in the event we and our partner can achieve certain specified development targets, we and our partner would establish and implement a worldwide manufacturing and commercialization plan relating to such compounds.
 
Personal Care
 
The Personal Care markets include F&F ingredients, skin care ingredients and cosmetic actives. To date, we have successfully brought two F&F ingredients to market with a collaboration partner and have several other ingredients for all three areas under development.

Our technology allows us to cost-effectively produce natural oils and aroma chemicals that are commonly used in the F&F market. Many of the natural ingredients used in the F&F market are expensive because there is limited supply and the synthetic alternatives require complex chemical conversions. We offer F&F companies a natural route to procure these high-value ingredients without sacrificing cost or quality.
 
In late 2013, we commenced commercial production of our first F&F ingredient for a range of applications, from perfumes to laundry detergent, which is marketed by a collaboration partner which is a global F&F leader. In 2014, we completed our first production campaign of this ingredient at our Brotas biorefinery and shipped it to this collaboration partner. In late 2015, we commenced production and initial sales of our second F&F ingredient to the same collaboration partner.
 
We are currently working to develop and commercialize a variety of F&F ingredients that are either direct fermentation products or derivatives of fermentation products. Two of our Personal Care collaboration partners launched new products in 2016 using ingredients supplied by Amyris via our proprietary fermentation process. Both of these products have generated significant interest for use in consumer products. In addition, during 2016 we also completed R&D on two other ingredients and began scale-up work for commercialization.
 
Performance Materials
 
The Performance Materials markets consist consists of specialty chemicals used to produce products such as polymers, lubricants, solvents and transportation fuels.
 
Solvents
 
We have developed a best-in-class renewable solvent produced from farnesene. In addition to addressing regulatory and safety concerns over Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), our solvent product, which we market under the brand Myralene®, offers strong performance and environmental attributes. In 2015, we received approval from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to market and began commercializing Myralene®-based cleaning products as industrial cleaners for the auto service industry and other industrial applications.
Polymers
 
Our partners are developing applications for our farnesene that include high-performance polymers used in tires and other end-uses. In 2011, we began collaborating with Kuraray with an initial focus on using farnesene-based polymers to replace petroleum-derived additives in tires. During the collaboration, Kuraray developed farnesene-based liquid rubber (LFR), a tire additive that has superior cold and wet-grip properties for better performance. LFR reacts with tire rubber more easily than traditional materials and strengthens adhesion of rubber components to improve tire shape, stability and performance. In connection with our collaboration with Kuraray, multiple leading tire manufacturers have conducted and are continuing to conduct performance tests of this liquid rubber in tire formulations, and one such manufacturer, Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd., has adopted LFR as a performance enhancing additive for use in the production of certain of its tires. Also, during this period, Kuraray produced and began customer sampling and product evaluation for a new category of elastomer, Hydrogenated Styrenic Farnesene Copolymer (HSFC), which has demonstrated performance attributes that open opportunities for vibration-dampening product applications.

Cray Valley, a division of Total, has developed a new farnesene-based addition to its line of Wingtack ® hydrocarbon resins. This product not only represents their first such product based on a renewable feedstock, rather than traditional petroleum based hydrocarbons, but also offers unique performance attributes. These attributes expand the scope of the product line’s applications as tackifying additives to enhance the properties of a broad range of elastomers, including SIS, SBS, polyisoprene, butyl rubber, EPDM and SBR materials, as well as hot melt and hot melt pressure sensitive adhesives.
 
Lubricants
 
Base oils are the building blocks of lubricating oils and are currently derived from the crude oil refining process. Additives are materials added to base oils to change their properties, characteristics and/or performance (e.g., anti-foam, anti-wear, corrosion inhibitor, detergent, dispersant, pour point depressant, anti-oxidant, or friction modifier). Lubricants are manufactured by combining a base oil with additives required by lubricant product applications, including engine oils, gear oils, hydraulic oils and turbine oils. Farnesene may be chemically modified to serve as a base oil, additive and/or lubricant. The high-purity synthetic base oil and additive molecules that can be made from Biofene enable lubricant products to perform in harsh environments under extremes of temperature, moisture, dirt and/or wear.
 
We are pursuing the base oils and lubricants market through our joint venture Novvi. Additional details regarding Novvi are provided below under “Business-Joint Ventures.”
 
Solvents
 
We have developed a best-in-class renewable solvent produced from farnesene. In addition to addressing regulatory and safety concerns over Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), our solvent product, which we market under the brand Myralene®, offers strong performance and environmental attributes. In 2015, we received approval from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to market and began commercializing Myralene®-based cleaning products as industrial cleaners for the auto service industry and other industrial applications.
Transportation Fuels
 
We have partnered with Total to develop renewable transportation fuels from farnesene. Under such partnership, we produce renewable diesel (a farnesene derivative referred to as farnesane) and jet fuel that delivers energy density, engine performance and storage properties comparable to the best petroleum fuels today.

• | Jet Fuel. Our drop-in, renewable jet fuel is compliant with Jet A/A-1 fuel specifications and outperforms conventional petroleum-derived fuel in a range of performance metrics, including fit for purpose and greenhouse gas emission reduction potential, without compromising on performance or quality. Our renewable jet fuel is approved for use at a 10% blend level with petroleum jet fuel globally and for use by the US military.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Diesel. Our renewable diesel’s properties are superior to those of petroleum diesel, allowing it to be used as a drop-in replacement practically in any diesel engine today. Our renewable diesel is approved for use in the US at up to a 35% blend with petroleum diesel and in Brazil at up to a 30% blend. The US Maritime Division and U.S. Department of Transportation have validated our diesel as a renewable blend with maritime diesel fuel.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the future, as our development efforts with Total allow us to produce fuels at lower costs, we expect that our farnesane-based fuels business will be conducted through a joint venture we have established with Total (described in more detail below under “Business-Joint Ventures”). We have been limiting jet fuel and diesel sales in recent periods as sales of our fuels products have not been cost-effective given the current costs of producing farnesene and current market prices for petroleum fuels.
 
Amyris Branded Product Markets
 
Through basic chemical finishing steps, we are able to convert our farnesene molecule into squalane, which is used today as a premium emollient in cosmetics and other personal care products. We believe that our Neossance squalane offers performance attributes equal or superior to those of squalane derived from conventional sources. The ingredient traditionally has been manufactured from olive oil or extracted from deep-sea shark liver oil, which requires that the shark be killed in order to harvest its liver oil. The relatively high price and unstable supply of squalane in the past meant that its use was generally limited to luxury products or small quantities in mass-market product formulations. With our ability to produce a reliable supply of low-cost squalane that eliminates the need to harvest shark liver oil, we offer this ingredient at a price that we believe will drive increasing adoption by formulators. In addition to Neossance squalane, we offer a second, lower-cost emollient, Neossance hemisqualane, for the cosmetics market. In December 2016, we formed a joint venture for our Neossance business with Nikko, in which we hold a 50% interest. See below under “Business-Joint Ventures” for more information regarding our Neossance joint venture. The joint venture currently has Neossance emollient supply agreements with several regional distributors, including those with locations in Japan, South Korea, Europe, Brazil and North America, and, in some cases, directly with cosmetics formulators, which we transferred to the joint venture during the formation process.
 
In addition, in 2015 we launched our own consumer brand, BiossanceTM skin care products, featuring our Biofene-derived squalane. Under our BiossanceTM brand, we market and sell our products directly to retailers and consumers, initially in the United States. Biossance was initially sold solely through our ecommerce branded website and in 2016, we expanded the product line to include an expansive line of high-performance skin care products and opened up sales through Home Shopping Network (HSN). In October 2016, we announced our Biossance product line would begin to be carried at Sephora in 2017. In February 2017, we launched a full squalane based consumer cosmetic line at participating Sephora stores and Sephora online. All of the products are based on Amyris’s commitment to No CompromiseTM. Since the launch, sales have grown, and with Sephora’s partnership, we are looking to expand to more stores.
 
Collaborations
 
We believe that our leadership in the synthetic biology sector is demonstrated by collaboration partners who come to us to access our synthetic biology platform and industrial fermentation expertise. Together we seek to reduce environmental impact, enhance performance, reduce supply and price volatility, and improve profit margins. Our partners include Total, chemical companies such as Braskem S.A. (Braskem) and Kuraray, F&F companies such as Firmenich S.A. (Firmenich) and Givaudan International, SA (Givaudan), agricultural processing companies such as China National Cereals, Oils, and Foodstuff Corporation, nutraceutical companies such as Nenter & Co., Inc. (Nenter) and pharmaceutical companies such as Biogen, Inc. and Janssen Pharmaceutical (Janssen). Our work has also been funded by the U.S. government, including the Department of Energy (DOE) and DARPA, to develop technologies and processes capable of improving the ability to utilize biotechnology for the production of a broader range of molecules.

In 2016, Amyris entered into a partnership in the field of cosmetic actives and completed the engineering of a yeast strain that can produce the first target in this space at significantly reduced cost. This will enable our partner to expand the market for this molecule into new applications and products. The speed to market for this ingredient reinforces the value proposition and strength of the Amyris technology platform and Amyris’s ability to scale up products.
 
In addition to our collaborations for co-development of Health and Nutrition, Personal Care and Performance Material products, we have established collaborations and joint ventures for the development and commercialization of commodity products that will require larger investment of capital and longer lead times for commercialization than our existing portfolio. For example, we have established a collaboration and joint venture with Total to commercialize Biofene-based diesel and jet fuels, as described in more detail below. In connection with this arrangement, Total has provided substantial funding for Biofene research and development. In addition to this arrangement with Total, we have established our Novvi joint venture with Cosan, ARG and Chevron for the worldwide development, production and commercialization of renewable base oils for the automotive, industrial and commercial lubricants markets. In December 2016, we formed a joint venture for our Neossance business with Nikko, as discussed below. Additionally, Amyris's proprietary synthetic biology platform may be used to provide the pharmaceutical industry with an integrated discovery and production process for therapeutic compounds for which a natural source is scarce or unavailable, or for which chemical synthesis is not cost-effective.
 
In 2016, we established and developed collaboration relationships with pharmaceutical partners such as Biogen in order to develop an alternative cell line to mammalian cell cultures for the production of recombinant proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies. We also initiated two µPharmTM projects that utilize Amyris’s proprietary technology to develop customized libraries of natural and natural-like compounds for our partners’ selected targets.
 
Joint Ventures
 
Our business strategy is to generally focus our direct commercialization efforts on higher-value, lower-volume markets while establishing joint ventures to pursue our lower-margin, higher-volume commodity products, including for the commodity fuels and lubricants markets. We believe this approach will facilitate access to capital and resources necessary to support large-scale production and global distribution for our large-market commodity products as we continually improve our technology advantages and costs of production.
 
Total Amyris BioSolutions B.V.
 
We have entered into a series of agreements since 2011 to establish a research and development program and form a joint venture with Total to produce and commercialize Biofene-based diesel and jet fuels. We formed such joint venture, Total Amyris BioSolutions B.V. (TAB), in November 2013. With an exception for our fuels business in Brazil, the collaboration and joint venture established the exclusive means for us to develop, produce and commercialize fuels from Biofene. We granted TAB exclusive licenses under certain of our intellectual property to make and sell joint venture products. We also granted TAB, in the event of a buy-out of our interest in the joint venture by Total (which Total is entitled to do under certain circumstances described below), a non-exclusive license to optimize or engineer yeast strains used by us to produce farnesene for the joint venture’s diesel and jet fuels. As a result of these licenses, Amyris generally no longer had an independent right to make or sell Biofene fuels outside of Brazil without the approval of TAB.

Our agreements with Total relating to our fuels collaboration created a convertible debt financing structure for funding the research and development program. The collaboration agreements contemplated approximately $105.0 million in financing (or R&D Notes) for the collaboration, which as of January 27, 2015, had been completely funded by Total.
 
In July 2015, we entered into a Letter Agreement with Total (or, as amended in February 2016, the TAB Letter Agreement) regarding the restructuring of the ownership and rights of TAB (or the Restructuring), pursuant to which the parties agreed to enter into an Amended & Restated Jet Fuel License Agreement between us and TAB (or the Jet Fuel Agreement), a License Agreement regarding Diesel Fuel in the European Union (or the EU) between us and Total (or the EU Diesel Fuel Agreement, and together with the Jet Fuel Agreement, the Commercial Agreements), and an Amended and Restated Shareholders’ Agreement among us, Total and TAB (or, together with the Commercial Agreements, the Restructuring Agreements), and file a Deed of Amendment of Articles of Association of TAB, all in order to reflect certain changes to the ownership structure of TAB and license grants and related rights pertaining to TAB.
 
On March 21, 2016, we, Total and TAB closed the Restructuring and entered into the Restructuring Agreements.
 
Under the Jet Fuel Agreement, (a) we granted exclusive (co-exclusive in Brazil), world-wide, royalty-free rights to TAB for the production and commercialization of farnesene- or farnesane-based jet fuel, (b) we granted TAB the option, until March 1, 2018, to purchase our Brazil jet fuel business at a price based on the fair value of the commercial assets and on our investment in other related assets, (c) we granted TAB the right to purchase farnesene or farnesane for its jet fuel business from us on a “most-favored” pricing basis and (d) all rights to farnesene- or farnesane-based diesel fuel we previously granted to TAB reverted back to us. As a result of the Jet Fuel Agreement, we generally no longer have an independent right to make or sell, without the approval of TAB, farnesene- or farnesane-based jet fuels outside of Brazil.
 
Upon all farnesene-or farnesane-based diesel fuel rights reverting back to us, we granted to Total, pursuant to the EU Diesel Fuel Agreement, (a) an exclusive, royalty-free license to offer for sale and sell farnesene- or farnesane-based diesel fuel in the EU, (b) the non-exclusive right to make farnesene or farnesane anywhere in the world, but Total must (i) use such farnesene or farnesane to produce only diesel fuel to offer for sale or sell in the EU and (ii) pay us a to-be-negotiated, commercially reasonable, “most-favored” basis royalty and (c) the right to purchase farnesene or farnesane for its EU diesel fuel business from us on a “most-favored” pricing basis. As a result of the EU Diesel Fuel Agreement, we generally no longer have an independent right to make or sell, without the approval of Total, farnesene- or farnesane-based diesel fuels in the EU.
 
In addition, as part of the closing of the Restructuring and pursuant the TAB Letter Agreement, on March 21, 2016, we sold to Total one half of our ownership stake in TAB (giving Total an aggregate ownership stake of 75% of TAB and giving us an aggregate ownership stake of 25% of TAB) in exchange for Total cancelling (i) approximately $1.3 million of R&D Notes, plus all paid-in-kind and accrued interest under all outstanding R&D Notes (including all such interest that was outstanding as of July 29, 2015) and (ii) a note in the principal amount of Euro 50,000, plus accrued interest, issued to Total in connection with the original TAB capitalization. To satisfy its purchase obligation above, Total surrendered to us the remaining R&D Note of approximately $5 million in principal amount, and we executed and delivered to Total a new R&D Note containing substantially similar terms and conditions other than it is unsecured and its payment terms are severed from TAB’s business performance, in the principal amount of $3.7 million. See Note 16, “Subsequent Events” in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding such R&D Note.

As a result of, and in order to reflect, the changes to the ownership structure of TAB described above, on March 21, 2016, (a) we, Total and TAB entered into an Amended and Restated Shareholders’ Agreement and filed a Deed of Amendment of Articles of Association of TAB and (b) we and Total terminated the Amended and Restated Master Framework Agreement, dated December 2, 2013 and amended on April 1, 2015, between us and Total.
 
Novvi LLC
 
In June 2011, we entered into joint venture agreements with Cosan related to the formation of a joint venture to focus on the worldwide development, production and commercialization of base oils made from Biofene for the automotive, commercial and industrial lubricants markets. In September 2011, we formed Novvi, an entity that was initially jointly owned by Cosan U.S. and us. In March 2013, we entered into additional agreements with Cosan U.S. to (i) expand our base oils joint venture with Cosan to also include additives and lubricants and (ii) operate the joint venture exclusively through Novvi. Under these agreements, Amyris and Cosan U.S. each owned 50% of Novvi, and each shared equally in any costs and any profits ultimately realized by the joint venture.
 
In July 2016, ARG agreed to make a capital contribution of up to $10.0 million in cash to Novvi, subject to certain conditions, in exchange for a one third ownership stake in Novvi. In connection with such investment, we and Cosan U.S. also agreed to make certain contributions to Novvi in exchange for receiving additional membership units in Novvi. Following the ARG investment, assuming it is made in full, and the capital contributions of us and Cosan U.S., each of Novvi’s three members (i.e., ARG, the Company and Cosan U.S.) will own one third of Novvi’s issued and outstanding membership units. In July 2016, the Novvi joint venture documents were amended in order to reflect the ARG investment in Novvi and related transactions.
 
In November 2016, Chevron made a capital contribution of $1.0 million in cash to Novvi in exchange for 20,000 membership units, representing an approximately 3% ownership stake in Novvi, which reduced the ownership interests of Amyris, Cosan U.S. and ARG pro rata.
 
SMA Indústria Química S.A.
 
In April 2010, we established SMA Indústria Química (SMA), a joint venture with São Martinho S.A. (SMSA), to build a production facility in Brazil.
 
We completed a significant portion of the construction of the new facility in 2012. We suspended construction of the facility in 2013 in order to focus on completing and operating our smaller production facility in Brotas, Brazil and in December 2015, we and SMSA entered into termination and a Share Purchase and Sale Agreement relating to the termination of the joint venture. December 2015, we and SMSA entered into a Termination Agreement and a Share Purchase and Sale Agreement relating to the termination of the joint venture. Under the Termination Agreement, the parties agreed that the joint venture would be terminated effective upon the closing of the purchase by Amyris Brasil of SMSA’s 50,000 shares of SMA (representing all of the shares of SMA held by SMSA) for R$50,000 (approximately US $15.342 based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2016) pursuant to the Share Purchase and Sale Agreement, The purchase and sale of SMSA’s shares of SMA by Amyris Brasil was consummated on January 11, 2016. The Share Purchase and Sale Agreement also provided that Amyris and Amyris Brasil would have 12 months following the closing of the share purchase to remove assets from SMSA’s site, and would enter into an extension of the lease for such 12 month period for monthly rental payments of R$9,853 (approximately US$3,023 based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2016. In September 2016, the parties entered into an addendum to the Share Purchase and Sale Agreement (and a corresponding amendment to the lease) which extended the deadline to remove assets from SMSA’s site to December 31, 2017.

Neossance, LLC
 
In December 2016, we entered into joint venture agreements with Nikko related to the formation of a joint venture to focus on the worldwide commercialization of our Neossance cosmetic ingredients business. In December 2016, we formed the joint venture under the name Neossance, LLC (Neossance), which is jointly owned by us and Nikko. Pursuant to the joint venture agreements relating to Neossance, we contributed certain assets to Neossance, including certain intellectual property and other commercial assets relating to our Neossance cosmetic ingredients business, as well as the production facility in Leland, North Carolina and related assets purchased by us from Glycotech in December 2016. We also agreed to provide Neossance with licenses to certain intellectual property necessary to make and sell products associated with the Neossance business. At the closing of the formation of the joint venture, Nikko purchased a 50% interest in Neossance in exchange for an initial payment of $10 million and the profits, if any, distributed from Neossance to Nikko as a member in cash during the three year period following December 12, 2016, up to a maximum of $10 million. In addition, as part of the formation of Neossance, we and Nikko agreed to make working capital loans to Neossance and we further agreed to execute, and cause Amyris Brasil to execute, a supply agreement to supply farnesene to Neossance, to guarantee a maximum production cost for certain products to be produced by Neossance and to bear any cost of production above such guaranteed costs.
 
Product Distribution and Sales
 
We distribute and sell (intend to distribute and sell) our products directly, to distributors or collaborators, or through joint ventures, depending on the market. For most of our products, we sell directly to our collaboration partners, except for our consumer care products, which we sell to distributors and formulators (other than our Biossance™ brand, which we sell directly to retailers and consumers in the United States). Generally, our collaboration agreements do not include any specific purchase obligations, and sales are contingent upon achievement of technical and commercial milestones.
 
For transportation fuels in Brazil, we sell our renewable diesel directly to fuels blenders and distributors. For transportation fuels outside of Brazil, we have typically sold our products to Total or to fuels blenders and distributors. Eventually, we expect to commercialize commodity products, including sales of fuels and base oils, through our joint ventures TAB and Novvi, respectively.
 
Renewable product sales to Firmenich and collaboration revenues from Firmenich, Ginkgo Bioworks, Inc. and DARPA each accounted for more than 10% of our reported revenues in 2016.

Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies, and to operate without infringing in the proprietary rights of others. We seek to avoid the latter by monitoring patents and publications in our product areas and technologies to be aware of developments that may affect our business, and to the extent we identify such developments, evaluate and take appropriate courses of action. With respect to the former, our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing for patent applications on inventions that are important to the development and conduct of our business with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO), and its foreign counterparts.
 
As of January 31, 2017, we had approximately 500 issued U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 350 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications that are owned or co-owned by or licensed to us. We also use other forms of protection (such as trademark, copyright, and trade secret) to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach provides us with a strong proprietary position.
 
Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by patents, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies and product candidates.”
 
We also protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisers to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. In addition, we also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
 
Competition
 
We expect that our renewable products will compete with products produced from traditional sources as well as from alternative production methods that established enterprises and new companies are seeking to develop and commercialize.
Health and Nutrition
 
Many active ingredients in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical markets are made via chemical synthesis by suppliers that have a deep chemistry knowhow and production facilities, including Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) manufacturers and ingredient suppliers. We may compete directly with these companies with respect to specific ingredients or attempt to provide customers with more cost effective or higher performing alternatives. For food ingredients, we compete with companies that produce products from plant and animal derived sources as well as with companies that are also developing biotechnology production solutions to produce specific molecules.

16
--

Personal Care
 
The main competition for Personal Care ingredients, such as fragrances and cosmetic actives is from products derived from plant and animal sources as well as chemical synthesis. The products derived from plant and animal sources are typically produced at a higher cost and create a greater impact on the environment compared to our products. Products derived from chemical synthesis are often produced at a low cost but have ramifications on sustainability as well as non-natural sourcing. There are also companies that are working to develop products using similar technology to us.
Performance Materials
 
In the Performance Materials markets that we have entered or are seeking to enter, we compete primarily with the established providers of materials currently used in products in these markets. Producers of these incumbent products include global oil companies, large international chemical companies, independent and integrated oil refiners, advanced biofuels companies and biodiesel companies, and companies specializing in specific products that directly compete with our Biofene product and its derivatives. We may also compete in one or more of these markets with products that are offered as alternatives to the traditional petroleum-based or other traditional products being offered in these markets.
Competitive Factors
 
We believe the primary competitive factors in both the chemicals and fuels markets are:
 

• | product price;
--+---------------


• | product performance and other measures of quality;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | infrastructure compatibility of products;
--+------------------------------------------


• | sustainability; and
--+--------------------


• | dependability of supply.
--+-------------------------

 
We believe that, for our products to succeed in the market, we must demonstrate that our products are comparable or better alternatives to existing products and to any alternative products that are being developed for the same markets based on some combination of product cost, availability, performance, and consumer preference characteristics.
 
Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters
 
Our development and production processes involve the use, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and permit requirements governing the use, generation, manufacture, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of these materials in the United States, Brazil and other countries where we operate or may operate or sell our products in the future. These laws, regulations and permits can require expensive fees, pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impact of our technology on the environment and violation of these laws could result in significant fines, civil sanctions, permit revocation or costs from environmental remediation. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental regulations and permitting. However, future developments including our commencement of commercial manufacturing of one or more of our products, more stringent environmental regulation, policies and enforcement, the implementation of new laws and regulations or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. See “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business - We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.”

GMM Regulations
 
The use of genetically-modified microorganisms (GMMs), such as our yeast strains, is subject to laws and regulations in many countries. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the commercial use of GMMs as well as potential products produced from the GMMs. Various states within the United States could choose to regulate products made with GMMs as well. While the strain of genetically modified yeast that we use, S. cerevisiae, is eligible for exemption from EPA review because it is generally recognized as safe, we must satisfy certain criteria to achieve this exemption, including but not limited to, use of compliant containment structures and safety procedures. In Brazil, GMMs are regulated by the National Biosafety Technical Commission (CTNBio) under its Biosafety Law No. 11.105-2005. We have obtained approvals from CTNBio to use GMMs in a contained environment in our Brazil facilities for research and development purposes as well as at contract manufacturing facilities in Brazil. In addition, we have obtained initial commercial approvals from CTNBio for two of our yeast strains.
 
We expect to encounter GMM regulations in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to make our products; however, the scope and nature of these regulations will likely vary from country to country. If we cannot meet the applicable requirements in countries in which we intend to produce our products using our yeast strains, then our business will be adversely affected. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Our use of genetically-modified feedstocks and yeast strains to produce our products subjects us to risks of regulatory limitations and rejection of our products.”
 
Chemical Regulations
 
Our renewable products may be subject to government regulations in our target markets. In the United States, the EPA administers the requirements of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which regulates the commercial registration, distribution and use of many chemicals. Before an entity can manufacture or distribute significant volumes of a chemical, it needs to determine whether that chemical is listed in the TSCA inventory. If the substance is listed, then manufacture or distribution can commence immediately. If not, then in most cases a “Chemical Abstracts Service” number registration and pre-manufacture notice must be filed with the EPA, which has 90 days to review the filing. A similar requirement exists in Europe under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (REACH) regulation. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our renewable products.” In 2013, the EPA registered farnesane as a new chemical substance under the TSCA, clearing the way for us to manufacture and sell farnesane without restriction in the United States.

Fuel Regulations
 
Our diesel and jet fuel is subject to regulation by various government agencies. In the United States, this includes the EPA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB). In Brazil, this includes Brazilian Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gas Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP).
 
We have completed significant steps to validate our ability to produce a market-accepted diesel product:
 

• | Due to the similarity of its chemical composition to that of existing petroleum-sourced diesel, our diesel product has the properties required of diesel fuel and thereby satisfies the American Society for Testing and Materials International (ASTM International) D975 Table 1 specifications for petroleum-derived diesel fuel oils. The EPA has registered our diesel for use as a 35% blend rate with petroleum diesel in highway vehicles and non-road equipment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In Europe, we obtained REACH registration for importing/manufacturing up to 1,000 metric tons of farnesane (our diesel fuel) per year and are pursuing data validation for greater volumes. REACH registration is required for the sale and use of our fuels within the applicable European jurisdictions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have received required approvals from ANP for specific uses of our diesel fuel in Brazil, have registered our diesel fuel with CARB and are pursuing registration or approvals with other relevant regulatory bodies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In 2013, the EPA registered farnesane as a new chemical substance under the TSCA, clearing the way for us to manufacture and sell farnesane without restrictions in the United States.
 
Jet fuel (aviation turbine fuel) validation and specifications are subject to the ASTM International industry consensus process and the ANP national adoption process. Our farnesane is generally approved for use in jet fuel for commercial flights at blends of up to 10%. This jet fuel blend was approved by ASTM International in June 2014. ASTM International approval is required by U.S. and international regulators before jet fuel can be used commercially. In December 2014, the same jet fuel was approved by ANP, which is an additional step required for Brazil commercialization.
 
For us to maximize our access to the U.S. fuels market for our fuel products, we will also need to obtain EPA and CARB (and potentially other state agencies) certifications for our feedstock pathway and production facilities, including certification of a feedstock lifecycle analysis relating to greenhouse gas emissions. Any delay in obtaining these additional certifications could impair our ability to sell our renewable fuels to refiners, importers, blenders and other parties that produce transportation fuels as they comply with federal and state requirements to include certified renewable fuels in their products. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our renewable products.”
 
Employees
 
As of January 31, 2017, we had 440 full-time employees. Of these employees, 280 were in the United States and 160 were in Brazil. Except for labor union representation for Brazil-based employees based on labor code requirements in Brazil, none of our employees is represented by a labor union or is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good.

Financial information regarding revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area is included in Note 15, "Reportable Segments” in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Business Background and Available Information
 
We organized our business in July 2003 as a California corporation under the name Amyris Biotechnologies, Inc. and have maintained our headquarters and research facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area since that time. In April 2010, we reincorporated in Delaware and changed our name to Amyris, Inc. We commenced research activities in 2005, focusing on the development of an alternative source of artemisinic acid for the treatment of malaria, and launched research efforts for production of Biofene in 2006. In 2008, we began to sell third party ethanol to wholesale customers through our Amyris Fuels subsidiary, which generated revenue from the sale of ethanol and reformulated ethanol-blended gasoline to wholesale customers through a network of terminals in the eastern United States. We completed our planned transition out of the ethanol and ethanol-blended gasoline business in the third quarter of 2012, though we continue to maintain the Amyris Fuels subsidiary for activities related to renewable fuel sales. We first established a presence in Brazil in 2008 through the opening of offices and laboratories in Campinas. Our corporate headquarters are located at 5885 Hollis Street, Suite 100, Emeryville, California 94608, and our telephone number is (510) 450-0761. Our website address is www.amyris.com. The information contained in or accessible through our website or contained on other websites is not deemed to be part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
