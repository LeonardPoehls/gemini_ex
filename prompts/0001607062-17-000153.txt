ITEM 1: BUSINESS
Section 1.1 The Company
 
Kiwibox.Com, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on April 19, 1988 under the name Fortunistics, Inc. On November 18, 1998, the
 
Company changed its name to Magnitude Information Systems, Inc. On December 31, 2009, the Company changed its name to Kiwibox.Com, Inc.
 
On August 16, 2007 the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Kiwibox Media, Inc., a social media network dedicated to young adults.
 
The Company, its subsidiary Magnitude, Inc. and Kiwibox Media Inc. were separate legal entities until December 31, 2009, with Kiwibox Media, Inc. being a wholly owned subsidiary. The 1% of Magnitude, Inc. not owned by the Company constituted a minority interest which was valued at $0. On December 31, 2009, the two subsidiaries Magnitude, Inc. and Kiwibox Media, Inc. merged into the Company.
 
On September 30, 2011, Kiwibox.com acquired the German based social network Kwick! (see Note 1 of the Financial Statements). On December 18, 2013 the company sold 80% of its ownership interest in Kwick! (see Note 1 of the Financial Statements).
 
On September 24, 2013, Kwick Community GmbH & Co. KG signed an equity purchase agreement to acquire Interscholz Internet Services GmbH and Co KG, a German limited liability company, and all the equity of its general partner, Interscholz Beteiligungs GmbH. As of the balance sheet date, and pursuant to the terms of the contract, since full payment was not made for the purchase price of Interscholz Internet Services GmbH & Co KG, ownership does not transfer to Kwick Community GmbH & Co KG. Full payment must be made for ownership to transfer to Kwick. As of December 31, 2013 only $515,037 of the total purchase price of $1,352,000 was made. On December 9, 2013 the acquisition of Interscholz Internet Services GmbH and Co KG by Kwick was rescinded due to non compliance with the terms of the addendum to the contract, calling for the full purchase price to have been paid. However, Kwick did acquire all the equity of the general partner, Interscholz Beteiligungs GmbH, as full payment was not a requirement for transfer of ownership of that entity.
 
On December 10, 2013, the Company signed an Equity Purchase Agreement with Marcus Winkler to sell to him eighty (80%) percent of the equity of its German subsidiary, KWICK! Community GmbH & Co. KG, a German limited liability company, and Kwick! Beteiligungs GmbH, its general partner (collectively, “Kwick”). The sale was approved on December 18, 2013. Due to the fact that the parent company ceased to have a controlling financial interest in Kwick, the subsidiary was deconsolidated from that date forward. On December 30, 2013 a total of 15% of the remaining 20% of the equity of Kwick was transferred to the Chief Executive Officer of Kwick (the “Kwick CEO”), in consideration for the Kwick CEO pledging to the bank 5,000 Euros as collateral, on behalf of Kiwibox, for bank overdrafts incurred by “Kwick’s” wholly-owned subsidiary Interscholz Beteiligungs GmbH, as general partner (managing partner) for Interscholz Internet Services GmbH & Co KG; as it is the duty of the general/managing partner to secure liquidity for the partnership. Since Kiwibox owned 20% of Kwick they were required, under German law, as managing partner of Interscholz Beteiligungs GmbH to secure liquidity for Interscholz Internet Services GmbH & Co KG. Therefore, 15% of Kiwibox’s 20% of Kwick was given to the Kwick CEO in exchange for the CEO pledging the necessary collateral. In addition to the collateral given by the Kwick CEO, as new 15% shareholder of Kwick, the Kwick CEO also agreed to keep the Interscholz Beteiligungs GmbH business going. This transfer was unanimously approved with written consent of the Board of Directors. Since the fair value of Kiwibox’s interest in Kwick is zero, this transaction had no material impact on the financial statements.
 
The Company is currently subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company has the authority to issue an aggregate of One Billion Four Hundred Million (1,400,000,000) Common Shares, par value $.0001, following an increase from 700,000,000 shares, authorized by the Company on January 29, 2009, with authorization to issue up to Three Million (3,000,000) “blank check” Preferred Shares, par value $.001, of which at December 31, 2011, Two Thousand Five Hundred (2,500) were designated as Cumulative Preferred Shares, par value $.001; Three Hundred Thousand (300,000) were designated as Series A Senior Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001; Three Hundred Fifty Thousand (350,000) were designated as Series B Senior Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001; One Hundred Twenty Thousand (120,000) were designated as Series C Senior Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001; Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) were designated as Series D Senior Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001; Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) were designated as Series E Senior Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001, and Forty-Three Thousand Six Hundred Ten (43,610) were designated Series G Senior Convertible Preferred Stock

We own and operate “Kiwibox.com”, a social networking website. Initially launched in 1999, Kiwibox.com is a social network.
 
Kiwibox Operations
 
Kiwibox.com is a social network for young adults all around the world for web and mobile usage, a community to find new friends and to meet new people online and in the real world.

Potential Revenue Streams and Marketing Strategy
 
Currently we generate all of our revenue from advertising/sponsorships. We anticipate revenue growth from increased membership activity and our revitalized website as we continue to implement new marketing strategies. Our software and networking technologies that we incorporated during the last 4 years now permit our mobile devices to accept and receive direct advertising. Our social networks permit us to work with potential advertisers to identify the right member groups for direct target advertising, a marketing channel that is readily accessible to our social media community.
 
Our continuing membership growth is fueled by infiltrating our users into local event venues where they participate and simultaneously communicate with our social network via the regular deployment of our cutting-edge App updates. As a result, the Kiwibox network enjoys continuing user sign-ups and continuing loyalty of users to our social network.
 
Community means social network – and thrives on membership networking. Our website is based on the latest web technology which makes it easier for users to stay connected and to interact with each other.

Market Position
 Our social media’s market penetration continues to rely upon our innovations where we strive to enhance our member’s experiences with our community. Our members enjoy our interactive platforms where we blog, play games, chat and share pictures.
 The Kiwibox Network is in a unique position because it combines the excitement of a dating community with the benefits and accessibility of a real social network. This community behavior binds users to the platform and is the base for our viral marketing.
 Market Position-What’s New
 Kiwibox is using its growing community to establish its brand throughout social media outlets. We continue to expand our membership and community events, highlighting our active presence in the marketplace.
 Kiwibox attracts more young adventurers who seek friendship and community involvement every day.


Safety
 
Kiwibox.com has developed an effective monitoring model which assists in maintaining a safe site for our member base, combining both technology based systems and user moderation. Users communicate and share information in an environment where they feel both secure and at ease. Members of the Kiwibox team monitor forums and groups daily to ensure the content is appropriate.
 
In addition to our monitoring system, the Kiwibox.com platform is equipped with advanced technology safety features. This includes the private sphere configuration of users, contact blocs for larger age differentials, anti-spam protection and intelligent self-learning user-scoring feature. In addition to this, Kiwibox.com has implemented state of the art security features such as former Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo’s hash value database in order to block images of illegal sexual content. With the combination of human moderation and advanced technology, users are afforded a safe and secure site.
 
Competition
 
Our primary competitors are other online social networks, including Facebook, Instagram, Tinder and tumbler. Facebook is widely considered as the industry leaders, however, recently statistics and strategic announcements have indicated a shift in the target audience from teens and college students to a much broader and more adult demographic, because of their international focus. We plan to distinguish ourselves by targeting the US-market and by combining the social-network advantages with user generated content – from users to users, while stressing the community feeling.

Intellectual Property
 
The Kiwibox.com web and mobile software and other related intellectual property rights are important assets. Most of our software is unique and individual and developed internally.
Governmental Regulations
 
Our Kiwibox website operations are subject to state, federal and international laws, rules and regulations that cover on-line business, privacy policies, consumer protection and product marketing. The Kiwibox website business is subject to state, federal and international laws, rules and regulations applicable to online commerce, including user privacy policies, product pricing policies, website content and general consumer protection laws.  Various laws, rules and regulations have been adopted, and probably will be adopted in the future, that apply to the Internet, including available online content, privacy concerns, online marketing, “spam” and unsolicited commercial email, taxation issues, and regulations that effect and monitor the quality of products and services.  
 
A portion of these laws, rules and regulations that concern the Internet and its uses have been only recently adopted. Courts and administrative agencies have not yet fully interpreted these legal requirements as to their application and scope. Accordingly, our Kiwibox website business is subject to the uncertainties of future interpretations and application of these legal requirements. The application and interpretation of these legal requirements or the passage of new and/or revised laws, rules and regulations could reduce the demand for Kiwibox website services, increase its operational costs, and expose it to potential liability. Any such events could have a material adverse effect upon our Kiwibox website business and financial condition. Our failure, or that of our business partners, to accurately predict and anticipate the interpretation or application of these laws, rules and regulations, whether now in force or adopted in the future, could have a detrimental impact on our operations, create negative publicity for us and expose us to potential liability.
 
State and federal agencies are applying consumer protection laws to regulate the on-line use, collection and dissemination of personal information and website content. These laws require us to implement programs to notify our website users of our privacy and security programs. Consumer protection laws will require us to obtain the consent of our website users if we want to collect and use certain portions of their personal information.
 
The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) is the lead federal agency monitoring Internet websites and their content. State attorneys general have become active monitors of the Internet at the local State level. These governmental bodies may investigate or bring enforcement actions against website operators they deem in violation of applicable consumer protection laws. We believe that our Kiwibox website’s collection and dissemination of information programs, including our privacy policies, do and will continue to comply with existing laws. However, a decision by a federal or state agency that any of our Kiwibox website’s business practices do not meet applicable legal standards could result in liability and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 
Employees
 
Currently, we have 3 employees.
