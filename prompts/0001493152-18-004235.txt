Item 1. Business
Overview
 
I.D. Systems, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1993. I.D. Systems, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “I.D. Systems,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) develops, markets and sells wireless machine-to-machine (“M2M”) solutions for managing and securing high-value enterprise assets. These assets include industrial vehicles such as forklifts and airport ground support equipment, rental vehicles, and transportation assets such as dry van trailers, refrigerated trailers, railcars and containers. Our patented systems utilize radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi, satellite or cellular communications, and sensor technology and software to address the needs of organizations to control, track, monitor and analyze their assets. Our solutions enable customers to achieve tangible economic benefits by making timely, informed decisions that increase the safety, security, revenue, productivity and efficiency of their operations.
 
On July 31, 2017, we, together with our wholly-owned subsidiary Keytroller, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Keytroller”), acquired substantially all of the assets of Keytroller, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (the “Keytroller Acquisition”). The business we acquired in the Keytroller Acquisition develops and markets electronic products for managing forklifts and construction vehicles. The Keytroller Acquisition gives us a full suite of industrial fleet management product offerings capable of covering any sized fleet and budget and provides our industrial truck business more scale, both from a product and revenue standpoint and markets its line of forklift management devices mainly through a network of lift truck dealers, offering solutions for different fleet sizes at a wide range of price points.

We have focused our business activities on three primary business solutions: (i) Industrial Truck Asset Management, (ii) Transportation Asset Management, and (iii) Connected Vehicle Solutions. Our solution for industrial truck asset management allows our customers to reduce operating risks including unsafe activity, facility equipment and goods damage, operational costs and capital expenditures and to comply with certain safety regulations by accurately and reliably measuring and controlling fleet activity. This solution also enhances security at industrial facilities and areas of critical infrastructure, such as airports, by controlling access to, and restricting the use of, vehicles and equipment. Our solution for transportation asset management allows our customers to increase revenue per asset deployed, reduce fleet size, and improve the monitoring and control of sensitive cargo. Our solutions for connected vehicles include unique Internet-of-Things (“IoT”) projects similar to projects we have delivered to Avis Budget Group. These engineering programs help our customers transform their operations. For Avis Budget Group, our rental fleet management platform assists rental car companies in generating higher revenue by more accurately tracking vehicle data, such as fuel consumption and odometer readings, and improving customer service by expediting the rental and return processes. In addition, our wireless solution for “car sharing” enables rental car companies to establish a network of vehicles positioned strategically around cities or on corporate campuses, control vehicles remotely, manage member reservations by smart phone or Internet, and charge members for vehicle use by the hour.
 
To provide an even deeper layer of insights into asset operations, we have developed a cloud-based software application called I.D. Systems Analytics (“Analytics”), which is designed to provide a single, integrated view of asset activity across multiple locations, that provides enterprise-wide benchmarks and peer-industry comparisons for key performance indicators (“KPIs”) relating to the performance of managed assets. Analytics enables values for the KPIs to be calculated and used to identify cost benefit measurements which translate the KPI values into monetized metrics. We expect that our growing database from monitored assets will allow us to create industry benchmarks that can be used to tell our customers how they are performing compared to their peers. We look for Analytics, as well as the data contained therein, to make a growing contribution to revenue, further differentiate and add value to our solutions, and help keep us at the forefront of the wireless asset management markets we serve.
 
We sell our solutions to both executive, division and site-level management within the enterprise. We also utilize channel partners such as independent dealers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who may opt for us to white label our product. Typically, our initial system deployment serves as a basis for potential expansion across the customer’s organization. We work closely with customers to help maximize the utilization and benefits of our system and demonstrate the value of enterprise-wide deployments. Post-implementation, we consult with our customers to further extend and customize the benefits to the enterprise by delivering enhanced analytics capabilities.
 
We market and sell our solutions to a wide range of customers in the commercial and government sectors. Our customers operate in diverse markets, such as automotive manufacturing, heavy industry, retail and wholesale distribution, transportation, aviation, aerospace and defense, homeland security and vehicle rental. Based on revenues for 2017, our top customers were Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Avis Budget Group.

Our Solutions
 
We design and implement wireless M2M asset management solutions that deliver both site-level and enterprise-level return on investment for our customers. Our solutions can be targeted to either campus-based assets or “over-the-road” assets.
Industrial Truck Asset Management Solutions
 
Our asset management solutions for campus-type and wide area-based assets incorporate wireless devices that provide on-board control, location tracking and data processing for enterprise assets, to provide real-time visibility of, and two-way communications with, such assets. These systems provide technological advantages that differentiate them from systems used for inventory, warehouse management and logistics tracking. For example, while inventory tracking systems rely on constant, continuous wireless connectivity to perform core functions, our systems require only periodic wireless communications and, our on-asset devices are designed to perform their core functions autonomously. Our enterprise-class software can run in the cloud or behind our customer’s firewall.
 
Our campus-based asset management system consists of four principal elements:
 

● | miniature wireless programmable computers attached to assets; these wireless devices may communicate via Wi-Fi, via the company’s proprietary IRF protocol, or via cellular link; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | optional, IRF-based, fixed-position communication infrastructure consisting of network devices with two-way wireless communication capabilities and, optional IRF-based location-emitting beacons for enhanced indoor location calculation; 
● | application-specific middleware servers, which are typically hosted in our data center, but may also be hosted on the customers’ local area network (LAN) or enterprise wide area network (WAN); and 
● | proprietary end-user software, which is a user-friendly web application that provides visibility and control of the system database, and which is hosted at the same data center as the middleware. As stated above, our enterprise software is flexible enough to run thousands of customers, sites or assets in either a customer hosted or in the cloud configuration. 

 
Each of these system elements can process and store information independently to create a unique, patented system of “distributed intelligence,” which mitigates the risk that a single point of failure could compromise system integrity or data and asset security. Our on-asset hardware stores and processes information locally so that it can autonomously and automatically control the asset and monitor asset activity regardless of the status or availability of other system components. Our on-asset hardware performs its functions even when outside the wireless range of any other system component or if the middleware is unavailable.
 
Our optional IRF infrastructure devices also independently process data and execute programmable application logic, in addition to linking monitored mobile asset data automatically to our system’s middleware. The link to the system’s middleware may leverage secure cellular communication, thereby permitting remotely-hosted server software without access to local IT infrastructure.
 
Our cellular “Hotspot” option allows our products to be outfitted on assets that go beyond campus boundaries such as aviation and construction equipment.
 
Our middleware applications populate the system’s database and is designed to mitigate the effects of any computer outages that could affect real-time availability of the database.
 
Finally, our client software interfaces only with the database, not directly with our communication infrastructure or on-asset hardware, which restricts access to, and limits corruption of, system information and minimizes network bandwidth usage.

Our solutions for industrial fleet asset management allows fleet operators to reduce operating costs and capital expenditures, comply with certain safety regulations and enhance security.
 
To help improve fleet safety and security, our solutions provide vehicle operator access control to ensure that only trained and authorized personnel are able to use equipment, and impact sensing to assign responsibility for abusive driving.
 
Our solutions also provide: contactless operator identification; automatic wireless data communications; motion/idle detection, electronic vehicle inspection checklists for paperless compliance with governmental safety regulations; automatic reporting of emerging vehicle safety issues; automatic on-vehicle intervention, such as disabling equipment, in response to user-definable safety and security parameters; and remote vehicle deactivation capabilities, allowing a vehicle to be shut down manually or automatically under user-defined conditions.
 
In addition, our solutions are compatible with a wide range of electronic driver identification technologies and also provide indoor and outdoor vehicle/operator visibility through a combination of global positioning system (GPS) and RFID technologies, and geo-fencing to restrict vehicles from operating in prohibited areas or issue alerts upon unauthorized entry to such areas. Our solutions also support optional sensing elements to provide additional vehicle utilization data, including load detection data, battery data and activity meter data.
 
To analyze and benchmark vehicle utilization and operator productivity, our solutions automatically record a wide range of activity and enable detailed performance comparisons to help management make informed decisions about vehicle and manpower allocations. This can lead to operating cost savings through fleet and personnel reductions as well as increases in productivity. Our solutions also provide real-time and historical visibility of vehicle movements and other advanced asset management options.
 
To help reduce fleet maintenance costs, our solutions can automate and enforce preventative maintenance scheduling by:
 

● | wirelessly uploading usage data from each vehicle; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | defining various intervals and criteria for performing preventative maintenance; 
● | automatically prioritizing maintenance events based on weighted, user-defined variables; 
● | reporting in advance on vehicles with impending preventative maintenance events coming due; 
● | automatically sending reminders to individual vehicles or operators via the system’s text messaging module; and 
● | enabling remote lock-out of vehicles overdue for maintenance. 

 
Our solutions also enable maintenance personnel to locate and retrieve vehicles due for service via the system’s optional graphical viewer software and can provide automatic data feeds to our customers’ existing enterprise maintenance software systems.
 
A specialized application of our solution in the industrial fleet management and security market is vehicle security, particularly at airports, seaports and other areas of critical infrastructure. The airport market-specific version of our system is called AvRamp®, referencing the aviation industry and the ramp area at airports in which aircraft servicing equipment operates. To date, the most significant commercial deployment of the AvRamp system has been on fleets of aircraft ground support equipment at Newark Liberty International Airport for United Airlines and Chicago O’Hare International Airport and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport for AMR Corporation (American Airlines and American Eagle Airlines).

By leveraging a combination of cellular and satellite communications and web-based data management technologies, the Asset Intelligence VeriWise product family provides shippers and carriers with tools to better manage their trailer and container fleets, freight transport operations, and maintenance controls. VeriWise systems enable quick access to actionable intelligence that results in better utilization, control, and security of our customers’ freight-carrying assets.
 
Our transportation asset management systems consist of five principal elements:
 

● | cellular or satellite communicators attached to assets; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | GPS receivers that provide latitude/longitude location fixes that are transmitted based on logic resident in the communicator; 
● | proprietary browser-based graphical user interface that provides visibility and two-way control of the system database (the data can also be transmitted to the customer via XML or web services data feed); 
● | patented power management intelligence to ensure reliable system performance in a power-starved environment; and 
● | several sensor types, including cargo, motion, light, and tire inflation, that provide additional status information for the remote asset. 

 
To increase asset utilization, our VeriWise system can reduce the number of assets needed and/or increase the revenue generated per asset by:
 

● | monitoring asset pool size based on user-defined requirements; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | generating dormancy reports to flag under-utilized assets; 
● | alerting the driver to the location of the closest empty asset, resulting in a more rapid pick-up; and 
● | providing trailer detention alerts when an asset has exceeded the time allotted for unloading. 

 
To better control remote assets, our VeriWise system provides:
 

● | change in cargo status of an asset via our patented full-length cargo sensor; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | geo-fencing that alerts the customer when an asset is approaching or leaving its destination; and 
● | on-board intelligence utilizing a motion sensor and proprietary logic that identifies the beginning of a drive and the end of a drive. 

 
To help improve asset and cargo security, our VeriWise system offers the following capabilities:
 

● | asset lockdown, which automatically sends an e-mail or text message to the customer when movement is detected outside of user-defined time periods; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | emergency track functionality that can be enabled to track an asset at more frequent intervals if a theft condition is expected; and 
● | geo-fencing, which can alert our customer when an asset enters a prohibited geography or location.

Connected Vehicle Solutions
 
In our connected vehicle solutions, we engage customers on unique IoT, M2M challenges that enable them to have considerable competitive advantage or to improve revenue or decrease their costs of operations.
 
Our second major telematics development for Avis Budget Car Rental, LLC (“ABCR”), a subsidiary of Avis Budget Group, includes the development of a Unified Telematics Platform (“UTP”) and deployment of 50,000 units. This solution supports several modes of operation: traditional, manned lot operations, such as at airports; remote, unmanned lots, such as designated street-level rental ‘pods’ and parking spaces; and the emerging ‘rent anywhere’ model. The initial shipments and installation of 50,000 units is planned for early 2018.
 
Our first program in 2011 with ABCR resulted in the deployment of 30,000 units for automated check-in/check-out and capturing customer billing using accurate fuel and odometer readings over the five-year term of the agreement. These 30,000 devices were cost-effectively installed and reinstalled annually by the ABCR personnel throughout the contract term.
 
For traditional rental fleet management, our system is designed both to enhance the consumer’s rental experience and benefit the rental company by providing information that can be used to increase revenues, reduce costs and improve customer service. Our rental fleet management system automatically uploads vehicle identification number, mileage and fuel data as a vehicle enters and exits the rental lot, which can significantly expedite the rental and return processes for travelers and provide the rental company with more timely inventory status, more accurate billing data that can generate higher fuel-related revenue, and an opportunity to utilize customer service personnel for more productive activities, such as inspecting vehicles for damage and helping customers with luggage.
 
Our solution for “car sharing” permits a rental car company to remotely control, track and monitor their rental vehicles wherever they are parked. Whether for traditional ‘pod-based’ rental or for the emerging rent-anywhere model, the system also (i) manages member reservations by smart phone or Internet, and (ii) charges members for vehicle use by the hour. The entire process - from remotely controlling the car door locks to tracking car mileage and fuel consumption to billing for the transaction - is automatically conducted by an integration of wireless vehicle management technology and the rental company’s fleet management software.

The market for our solutions is rapidly evolving, highly competitive and fragmented. Our target markets are also subject to quickly changing product technologies, shifting customer needs, regulatory requirements and frequent introductions of new products and services. A significant number of companies have developed or are developing and marketing software and hardware for wireless products that currently compete or will compete directly with our solutions. We compete with organizations varying in size, including many small, start-up companies as well as large, well-capitalized organizations. While some of our competitors focus exclusively on providing wireless asset management solutions, many are involved in wireless technology as an extension of a broader business. Many of our larger competitors are able to dedicate extensive financial resources to the research and development and deployment of wireless solutions. As government and commercial entities expand the use of wireless technologies, we expect that competition will continue to increase within our target markets.
 
We attempt to distinguish ourselves from our competitors by focusing on three primary business solutions: (i) industrial truck asset management, (ii) transportation asset management, and (iii) connected vehicle solutions. This focus has enabled us to direct product development efforts specifically suited for our target markets. Our on-asset devices are designed to operate independently of other system components, allowing for continuous asset control and data gathering even when the asset is out of wireless communication range. We believe that our proprietary technology as well as our experience in designing and developing products for our target markets distinguishes us within these markets.
 
In each of our markets, we encounter different competitors due to the dynamics of each market. In the industrial truck asset management market, we are not aware of any competitors that can provide the precise capabilities of our systems due to our intellectual property and proprietary solutions; however, competitors do provide similar solutions that seek to address the same customer needs that our products address. Those companies include both emerging companies with limited operating histories, such TotalTrax Inc., and SpeedShield Technologies and companies with longer operating histories, greater name recognition and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than ours, such as Crown Equipment Corp.
 
In the transportation asset management market, we compete against several established competitors, including Omnitracs, LLC, SkyBitz, Inc., Orbcomm Inc. and Spireon, Inc. We attempt to differentiate our solutions in this market by offering a choice of communication mode (satellite or cellular), patented battery management technology, sensor options, and installation configurations (dry van trailers, domestic containers, flatbed trailers, covered hopper and tanker railcars, and chassis).
 
In the connected vehicles solutions market, our solutions for traditional airport-based rental fleet management compete primarily against existing handheld devices, which are used widely by vehicle rental companies. Currently, the principal handheld device providers we compete against include Motorola and Intermec which was acquired by Honeywell International Inc. Our solutions for remote, decentralized rental fleet management compete primarily with companies in the car sharing market such as Hertz, Enterprise, Zipcar and City Car Share. Large system integrators and several of the national cellular wireless providers have started to offer solutions, which package third party hardware, firmware and software, that compete with our solutions. In the markets for both types of rental fleet solutions, our competitive position is differentiated by our patented product offering - a fully automated, readily installed, and cost-effective car rental system.

Trademarks
 
We have, or have applied for, trademark protection for I.D. SYSTEMS® and Design, the I.D. SYSTEMS Logo®, VEHICLE ASSET COMMUNICATOR®, AVRAMP® and Design, POWERFLEET®, POWERFLEET VISION®, POWERFLEET IQ®, VERIWISE IQ®, and ASSET INTELLIGENCE®.
 
We attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in our product development and sales efforts. However, it is difficult to proceed with certainty in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential at the time of the application filing, with regard to similar technologies. If we were to discover that our products violate third-party proprietary rights, we may not be able to:
 

● | obtain licenses to continue offering such products without substantial reengineering; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | reengineer our products successfully to avoid infringement; 
● | obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; or 
● | litigate an alleged infringement successfully or settle without substantial expense and damage awards. 

 
Any claims against us relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, even if without merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources or in injunctions preventing us from distributing certain products. Such claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our software products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected, and policing such unauthorized use is difficult. In general, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual safeguards may not be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, or competitive with, those developed by us. Our failure or inability to protect our proprietary rights could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Manufacturing
 
We outsource our hardware manufacturing operations to contract manufacturers. This strategy enables us to focus on our core competencies - designing hardware and software systems and delivering solutions to customers - and avoid investing in capital-intensive electronics manufacturing infrastructure. Outsourcing also provides us with the ability to ramp up deliveries to meet increases in demand without increasing fixed expenses.
 
Our manufacturers are responsible for obtaining the necessary components and supplies to manufacture our products. While components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources, manufacturers generally depend on a limited number of suppliers. In the past, unexpected demand for communication products has caused worldwide shortages of certain electronic parts and allocation of such parts by suppliers that had an adverse impact on the ability of manufacturers to deliver products as well as on the cost of producing such products.
 
Due to the general availability of manufacturers for our products, we do not believe that the loss of any of our manufacturers would have a long-term material adverse effect on our business, although there could be a short-term adverse effect on our business.
 
We generally attempt to maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand for products, as well as to meet anticipated sales levels. If our product mix changes in unanticipated ways, or if sales for particular products do not materialize as anticipated, we may have excess inventory or inventory that becomes obsolete. In such cases, our operating results could be negatively affected.
 
Government Regulations
 
The use of radio emissions is subject to regulation in the United States by various federal agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. Various state agencies also have promulgated regulations which concern the use of lasers and radio/electromagnetic emissions standards.
 
Regulatory changes in the United States and other countries in which we may operate in the future could require modifications to some of our products in order for us to continue manufacturing and marketing our products in those areas.
 
Our products intentionally transmit radio signals, including narrow band and spread spectrum signals, as part of their normal operation. We have obtained certification from the FCC for our products that require certification. Users of these products in the United States do not require any license from the FCC to use or operate our products. To market and sell our integrated wireless solutions in the European Union, we also utilize unlicensed radio spectra, and have obtained the required European Norm (EN) certifications.
 
In addition, some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state and local laws governing the environment and worker health and safety, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Certain of our products are subject to various federal, state and local laws governing chemical substances in electronic products.
 
The adoption of unfavorable regulations, or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies, could require us to incur significant compliance costs, cause the development of the affected markets to become impractical or otherwise adversely affect our ability to produce or market our products.
 
Employees
 
As of March 15, 2018, we had 117 full-time employees, including 10 employees based in Germany and the United Kingdom. Of our 117 total employees, 30 were engaged in customer service, 21 in product development (which includes engineering), 4 in new product management, 12 in operations, 30 in sales and marketing, 4 in information technology and 16 in executive, administration and finance.
