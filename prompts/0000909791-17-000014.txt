Our Business
Lithography and ALD
We supply step-and-repeat photolithography systems based on one-to-one (“1X”) imaging technology to customers located throughout North America, Europe and Asia. We believe that our 1X steppers utilizing the Wynne Dyson optical design offer cost and performance advantages, as compared with competitors’ contact aligners or reduction steppers, to semiconductor 
 3

device manufacturers for applications involving line geometries of 0.75 microns or greater (“non-critical feature sizes”) and to nanotechnology manufacturers.
Advanced packaging manufacturing processes such as flip chip, wafer level chip scale packaging (“WLCSP”) and 3D packaging techniques, require several lithography steps in the device fabrication process. We believe that the use of flip chip technology will continue to gain traction as customers migrate towards leading edge technology nodes. It is expected that wafer level packaging technologies will continue to play an important role for continued miniaturization of electronic products such as smartphones. As customers transition to sub-28 nanometers (“nm”) manufacturing technology, traditional front end scaling is becoming increasingly complex. As such, semiconductor manufacturing companies are now also focusing on various packaging technologies such as Fan Out Wafer Package (“FO-WLP”) and Through Silicon Via (“TSV”) to play an important role in delivering improved system level performance in the future. The manufacturing approach utilizing FO-WLP or TSV technology alleviates interconnect delay considerations by reducing global interconnect wiring length. These advanced packaging techniques deliver superior bandwidth performance, power management improvements and address some device latency issues. In addition, several of our customers are also evaluating other packaging approaches such as silicon interposer technology solutions for delivering improved bandwidth and system level performance.
Lithography is one of the critical process steps that affect the final device performance and associated yield for advanced packaging technology. The use of 1X stepper technology provides superior operational flexibility for thick resists utilized in the advanced packaging market. Furthermore, the use of our proprietary alignment systems enables easy insertion of our products for any back end of line application. Lastly, we have also developed a large number of application specific features which deliver technology leadership and superior economic value for our packaging customers. Our steppers are used to manufacture high volume, low cost semiconductor devices used in a variety of applications such as communications, personal computing, automotive control systems, power systems and consumer electronics. We believe that our steppers offer advantages over certain competitive reduction lithography tools with respect to field size, throughput, specialized substrate handling and cost of ownership savings. 
In December 2012, we purchased certain assets of Cambridge NanoTech, Inc. (“Cambridge”) which was a technological leader in the ALD market. We will continue to pursue selling opportunities in the ALD market focusing our efforts on universities and research institutes. Additionally, we may sell these products for production applications.
Laser Anneal Technology
Device scaling has been the predominant means pursued by the semiconductor industry to achieve the gains in productivity and performance quantified by Moore’s Law. In the past several years, scaled device performance has been compromised because traditional transistor materials, such as silicon, silicon dioxide, and polysilicon, have been pushed to their fundamental materials limits. Continued scaling thus requires the introduction of new materials. For example, the traditional gate dielectric has been silicon dioxide, and as devices are scaled below 45 nm, high-k material such as hafnium oxide must be considered because silicon dioxide begins to lose its effectiveness. These new materials impose added challenges to the methods used to dope and activate silicon to produce very shallow, highly activated junctions (the main challenges regarding short channel effects include achieving maximum activation and minimal diffusion while maintaining abrupt junctions).
By leveraging our core competencies in optics engineering and system integration and our extensive knowledge of laser thermal processing, we introduced our laser spike annealing system to enable thermal annealing solutions at the 65 nm technology node and below. This advanced annealing technology provides solutions to the difficult challenge of fabricating ultra-shallow junctions and highly activated source/drain contacts. Laser thermal processing offers the flexibility to operate at near-instantaneous timeframes (microseconds to milliseconds) at temperatures below the melting point of silicon (1412° C). At these temperatures and anneal times, high activation is achieved with negligible diffusion. In addition, our proprietary hardware design minimizes the pattern density effect, reducing absorptivity variations resulting in a uniform temperature across the wafer.
Inspection
In 2012, we introduced a new in-line wafer inspection system, based on patented coherent gradient sensing technology (“CGS”) named Superfast. The CGS technology was developed at the California Institute of Technology during the 1990’s, and we acquired the rights to develop the CGS technology when we acquired certain assets of a semiconductor inspection startup, Oraxion Inc., in July 2006. We developed a next-generation system in 2007 which was primarily used internally. Our latest model introduced in 2015, Superfast 4G+, represents the fourth generation of this technology, which is focused on the inspection of a number of critical semiconductor process steps.

Our products and markets are more fully described below.
General Background
The fabrication of devices such as integrated circuits (“semiconductors” or “ICs”) requires a large number of complex processing steps, including deposition, photolithography and etching.
Photolithography is one of the most critical and expensive steps in IC device manufacturing. Photolithography exposure equipment is used to create device features by patterning a light-sensitive polymer coating on the wafer surface using a photomask containing the master image of a particular device layer. Typically, each exposure results in the patterning of a different deposited layer, and therefore requires a different pattern on the device. Each new device layer must be properly aligned to previously defined layers before imaging takes place, so that structures formed on the wafers are correctly placed, one on top of the other, in order to ensure a functioning device.
Since the introduction of the earliest commercial photolithography tools for IC manufacturing in the early 1960s, a number of tools have been introduced to enable manufacturers to produce ever more complex devices that incorporate progressively finer line widths. In the early 1970s, photolithography tools included contact printers and proximity aligners, which required the photomask to physically contact or nearly contact the wafer in order to transfer the entire pattern during a single exposure. By the mid-1970s, there were also projection scanners, which transferred the device image through reflective optics having a very narrow annular field that spanned the width of the wafer. Exposure was achieved by scanning the entire photomask and wafer in a single, continuous motion across the annular field. Scanners were followed by steppers, which expose a rectangular area or field on the wafer containing one or more chip patterns in a single exposure, then move or “step” the wafer to an adjacent site to repeat the exposure. This stepping process is repeated as often as necessary until the entire wafer has been exposed. By imaging a small area, steppers are able to achieve finer resolution, improved image size control and better alignment between the multiple device layers resulting in higher yield and higher performance devices than was possible with earlier tools.
The two principal types of steppers currently in use by the semiconductor industry are reduction steppers, which are the most widely-used steppers, and 1X steppers. Reduction steppers, which typically have reduction ratios of four- or five-to-one, employ photomask patterns that are four or five times larger than the device pattern that is to be exposed on the wafer surface. In addition, there is a fourth generation of lithography tools, known as step-and-scan systems that typically address device sizes of 0.35 micron and below. In contrast to steppers, which require lenses that cover the entire field, step-and-scan optical systems have an instantaneous field just large enough to span the width of a field and employ scanning to stretch coverage over the entire field. Each scan is followed by re-registration of the wafer with respect to the mask, i.e. “stepping”, to create multiple fields covering the entire wafer. The smaller instantaneous field size of step-and-scan system projection optical systems allows them to resolve finer geometries and scanning allows them to cover larger fields.
The principal advantage of reduction steppers and step-and-scan systems is that they may be used in manufacturing steps requiring critical feature sizes and are, therefore, necessary for manufacturing advanced ICs. 1X steppers, on the other hand, employ photomask patterns that are the same scale as the device pattern that is exposed on the wafer surface. The optical projection system employed in our 1X steppers is based on a Wynne Dyson design, which uses both a reflective mirror and refractive lens elements. This design approach leads to a very simple and versatile optical system that is less expensive than those employed in reduction steppers. Because our 1X optical design covers a much broader spectral range than reduction steppers, it delivers a greater proportion of the exposure energy from the lamp to the wafer surface. Depending on the size of the lamp used and the exposure energy required for an application, this can result in appreciably higher throughput. Resolution considerations currently limit 1X steppers to manufacturing steps involving less-critical, larger feature sizes. Accordingly, we believe that sales of these systems are highly dependent upon capacity expansions by our current 1X customers, or by customers making the transition to chips containing “bump” connections, that facilitate the use of higher data rates and a higher number of connections.
In the past, manufacturers of ICs and similar devices purchased capital equipment based principally on performance specifications. In view of the significant capital expenditures required to construct, equip and maintain advanced fabrication facilities, relatively short product cycles and manufacturers’ increasing concern for overall fabrication costs, we believe that focus has shifted to the total cost of ownership. Cost of ownership includes the costs associated with the acquisition of equipment, as well as components based on throughput, yield, up-time, service, labor overhead, maintenance, and various other costs associated with owning and using the equipment. As a result, in many cases, the most technologically advanced system will not necessarily be the manufacturing system that delivers the best cost of ownership.
 5

In addition to enhancing our current lithography solutions, we continue to develop new tools to serve markets such as advanced annealing. The LSA family of tools is aimed at volume production of advanced semiconductors. These products, based on the same platform and stage technology as our advanced lithography tools, employ a 3500 Watt carbon dioxide laser to activate ultra-shallow, transistor junctions. Annealing times are reduced from several seconds, typical for the current generation of Rapid Thermal Processing (“RTP”) equipment, to a millisecond or less. This results in more abrupt junctions with higher dopant activation levels and leads to transistors with higher drive currents and lower leakage. While this technology is expected to be useful for multiple IC generations, we anticipate that eventually this technology will be superseded by a laser thermal processing technology that will exceed the melting point of silicon (1412°C) and reduce the processing time below one microsecond, thereby achieving even higher performance characteristics with almost “zero” thermal budget. We continue to develop our new LXA laser melt technology targeted to deliver this capability. Melt annealing has the potential to be used for multiple generations across the front end of line (“FEOL”) and middle of line (“MOL”). We believe these new laser thermal processing technologies remove several critical barriers to future device scaling and will help to extend Moore’s Law well into the future.
Thermal annealing is used by the semiconductor industry for a variety of process steps, including activation of implanted impurities, dopant activation, dielectric film formation, formation of silicides and stabilization of copper grain structures. Our LSA systems compete with annealing tools currently in use by manufacturers of semiconductor devices, including both furnaces and RTP systems. It is widely recognized that there is a need for tools that anneal at higher temperatures for shorter periods of time. We believe our current laser annealing tools are already providing this capability in a production environment for dopant activation. Our customers are also working to develop other applications for our laser annealing tools such as high-k dieletric anneal and silicide formation.
As the next-generation device nodes are developed, the inspection requirements are rapidly evolving. Tighter device specifications, new materials and new device geometries necessitate new ways to identify and eliminate the sources of defects that compromise device performance and reduce yield. The cost of these defects is also increasing; not only do individual wafers have more value, but more importantly, rapid resolution of defects and process issues can dramatically reduce time-to-market by enabling the ramp to high volume production sooner. Traditional inspection techniques can often be difficult to extend without significant increase in cost of ownership or decrease in throughput. New inspection techniques that are accurate, precise, rapid and provide large amounts of data are essential for providing device manufacturers the insight into efficiently resolving manufacturing issues during development and high-volume production alike.
Products
We currently offer two different series of 1X lithography systems for use in the semiconductor fabrication process: the 1000 series, which addresses the markets for HBLED, semiconductor fabrication and nanotechnology applications; and the AP series, which is designed to meet the requirements of the advanced packaging market. These steppers currently offer minimum feature size capabilities ranging from 2.0 microns to 0.75 microns.
The 1000 series systems are small field systems available with gh-line, i-line and broadband ghi-line illumination options. We offer the Sapphire 100C and Sapphire 100E for HBLED applications and the Star 100 for semiconductor and nanotechnology applications. These 1000 series platform systems are typically used in the manufacture of HBLEDs, power devices, ASICs, analog devices and compound semiconductors as well as a number of nanotechnology applications.
Nanotechnology manufacturing combines electronics with mechanics in small devices. We have defined a nanotechnology device as a device that has at least one dimension in the XYZ direction less than 0.1 microns. Examples include accelerometers used to activate air bags in automobiles and membrane pressure sensors used in industrial control systems. These micro-machined devices are manufactured on silicon substrates using photolithography techniques similar to those used for manufacturing semiconductors.
Our Sapphire 100C and Sapphire 100E systems are configurable with customized options designed specifically for high volume HBLED manufacturing applications. The Sapphire 100C and Sapphire 100E are also based on the 1000 Series platform, with additional features developed specifically for HBLED lithography applications. HBLED manufacturing requires special substrate handling capabilities for the small diameter sapphire and silicon carbide substrates used to manufacture the LED devices for display backlighting and general lighting applications. For HBLED applications, we believe our Sapphire 100C and our Sapphire 100E steppers offer depth of focus, productivity and yield improvement advantages over competitive product offerings.
For the advanced packaging market, we offer our AP series built on the Unity Platform®. These advanced packaging systems were developed for high volume flip-chip, wafer-level and 3-D packaging applications. They provide broadband or 
 6

selective exposure (gh, i, or ghi-line), and are used in conjunction with downstream processes to produce a pattern of bumps, or metal connections, on the bond pads of the die for flip chip devices. Using flip chip interconnect may result in reduced signal inductance, reduced power/ground inductance, die shrink advantages and reduced package footprint.
The AP series, consisting of the AP300W, AP300 and AP200, is built on our Unity Platform and features a customer-configurable design that supports flexible manufacturing requirements as well as tool extendibility for multiple device generations. Designed specifically for advanced packaging applications, the AP systems integrate the processing advantages associated with our advanced packaging lithography equipment with the productivity benefits of our Unity Platform. We believe that this family of lithography systems support a lower cost-of-ownership strategy due to significant throughput enhancements, higher reliability, and superior alignment and illumination systems.
We offer a family of advanced laser-based thermal annealing tools built on our Unity Platform. In addition to our flagship model, the LSA101, which enables junction activation and other advanced front-end annealing processes for the 45nm node and below, we have introduced a novel dual beam technology extending the system's capabilities to lower processing temperatures (LSA101LP). The addition of the LP dual beam is targeted to enable MOL applications such as silicide formation. The LSA201 is our latest LSA product offering, which enables full-wafer ambient control processing targeted for sub-20nm nodes. The LSA201's simple and robust design includes our patented micro-chamber design for achieving ambient control in a scanning system. The LSA201 platform can also be configured with the dual beam laser mentioned above-named the LSA201LP. As devices scale below 20nm, we believe the ambient control capability enables new applications such as high-k anneal and film property modification. 
In 2012, we introduced our new in-line wafer inspection system, the Superfast 3G, which provides the flexibility to address a wide range of applications including improved overlay control and enhanced yield. In 2015, we released our next generation version, the Superfast 4G+. At advanced technology nodes, variations in stress and distortion on a wafer can have a significant impact on device performance and yield. Based on CGS technology, we believe that our Superfast system provides the industry’s highest wafer resolution for the targeted applications and measures over 3 million points of data per 300mm wafer. The Superfast system is unique in that it collects data from the whole wafer simultaneously, providing significantly higher data density without the need for targets or pads. The system’s high data density enables a wide range of applications from one measurement, as within-die, die-to-die and wafer-to-wafer process variations can be characterized quickly and comprehensively. Utilizing the Superfast system provides other key advantages as well. First, data is obtained within each die at the location of the devices (not the location of a test target) and within-die variations can be mapped via approximately 10,000 data points. Second, data acquisition is inherently faster using rapid image capture of the whole wafer with a camera. Third, data is obtained to within 2mm of the wafer edge, providing a means to characterize issues with edge-die, which dominate yield loss at leading edge nodes.
In addition to selling new systems, we sell upgrades to systems in our installed base.    
Research, Development and Engineering
The semiconductor and nanotechnology industries are subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements. We believe that continued and timely development and introduction of new and enhanced systems to serve these markets is essential for us to maintain our competitive position. We have made and continue to make substantial investments in the research and development of our core optical technology, which we believe is critical to our future financial results. We intend to continue to develop our technology and to develop innovative lower cost of ownership products and product features to meet customer demands. Current engineering projects include continued research and development and process insertion for our laser thermal processing technologies, continued development of our 1X stepper products ongoing evolution of our inspection technologies, as well as other new products. Other research and development efforts are currently focused on: performance enhancement and development of new features for existing systems, both for inclusion as a standard component in our systems and to meet special customer order requirements; increased productivity; reliability improvements; and manufacturing cost reductions. These research and development efforts are principally undertaken, by our research, development and engineering organizations and costs are generally expensed as incurred. Other operating groups within Ultratech support our research, development and engineering efforts, and the associated costs are expensed as incurred.
We work with many customers to jointly develop technology required to manufacture advanced devices or to lower the customer’s cost of ownership. We also have a worldwide engineering support organization including reticle engineering, photo processing capability and applications support.
 7

We have historically devoted a significant portion of our financial resources to research and development programs and expect to continue to allocate significant resources to these efforts in the future. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 80 full-time employees engaged in research, development and engineering. For 2016, 2015 and 2014, total research, development and engineering expenses were approximately $35.2 million, $32.9 million and $33.6 million, respectively, and represented 18%, 22% and 22% of our net sales, respectively.
Sales and Service
We market and sell our products in North America, Europe and Asia principally through our direct sales organization. We also have service personnel based throughout the United States, Europe, Japan and the rest of Asia. We believe that as semiconductor and nanotechnology device manufacturers produce increasingly complex devices, they will require an increased level of support. Global support capability as well as product reliability, performance, yield, cost, uptime and mean time between failures are increasingly important factors by which customers evaluate potential suppliers of photolithography equipment. We believe that the strength of our worldwide service and support organization is an important factor in our ability to sell our systems, maintain customer loyalty and reduce the maintenance costs of our systems. In addition, we believe that working with our suppliers and customers is necessary to ensure that our systems are cost effective, technically advanced and designed to satisfy customer requirements.
We support our customers with field service, applications, technical support service engineers and training programs. We provide our customers with comprehensive support and service before, during and after delivery of our systems. To support the sales process and to enhance customer relationships, we work closely with prospective customers to develop hardware, applications, test specifications and benchmarks, and often design customized applications to enable prospective customers to evaluate our equipment for their specific needs. Prior to shipment, our support personnel typically assist the customer on-site preparation and inspection, and provide customers with training at our facilities or at the customer’s location. We currently offer our customers various courses of instruction on our systems, including instructions in system hardware and related applications tools for optimizing our systems to fit a customer’s particular needs. Our customer training program also includes instructions in the maintenance of our systems. Our field support personnel work with the customer to install the system and demonstrate system readiness. Technical support is also available via telephone 24 hours a day, seven days a week at our San Jose, California and Singapore locations and through our on-site personnel.
In general, we warrant our new systems against defects in design, materials and workmanship for one year. We offer our customers additional support after the warranty period for a fee in the form of service contracts for specified time periods. Service contracts include various options such as priority response, planned preventive maintenance, scheduled one-on-one training, daily on-site support, and monthly system and performance analysis.
Manufacturing
Until the third quarter of 2010, we performed all of our manufacturing activities (final assembly, system testing and certain subassembly) in clean room environments totaling approximately 25,000 square feet located in San Jose, California. Performing manufacturing operations in California exposes us to a higher risk of natural disasters, including earthquakes. In addition, California has previously experienced power shortages which have interrupted our operations. Such shortages could occur in the future and could again interrupt our operations resulting in product shipment delays, increased costs and other problems, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, customer relationships and results of operations.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010, we started a manufacturing operation in Singapore for the production of our lithography and inspection products. This facility consists of approximately 9,000 square feet of additional clean-room production space for the manufacturing of our advanced packaging Unity AP products, HBLED, Sapphire and Superfast inspection product platforms. 
Our manufacturing activities consist of assembling and testing components and subassemblies, which are then integrated into finished systems. We rely on a limited number of outside suppliers and subcontractors to manufacture certain components and subassemblies. We order one of the most critical components of our technology, the glass for our 1X lenses, from external suppliers. We design the 1X lenses and provide the lens specifications and the glass to external suppliers, who then machine the lens elements. We then assemble and test the optical 1X lenses. We have recorded the critical parameters of each of our optical lenses sold since 1988, and we believe that such information enables us to supply lenses to our customers that match the characteristics of our customers’ existing lenses.
We procure some of our other critical systems’ components, subassemblies and services from single outside suppliers or from a limited group of outside suppliers in order to ensure overall quality and timeliness of delivery. Many of these 
 8

components and subassemblies have significant production lead times. To date, we have been able to obtain adequate services and supplies of components and subassemblies for our systems in a timely manner. We are actively engaged with a number of our Asia-based suppliers to provide high precision parts and major opto-mechanical and electro-mechanical sub-assemblies and modules for our lithography products both in Singapore and San Jose. However, disruption or termination of certain of these sources could result in a significant adverse impact on our ability to manufacture our systems. This, in turn, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our reliance on a sole or a limited group of suppliers and our reliance on subcontractors exposes us to several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components due to the suppliers’ failure or inability to provide such components in a timely manner, or at all, to our standards of quality, and reduced control over pricing and timely delivery of components. Manufacture of certain of these components and subassemblies is an extremely complex process, and long lead-times are required. Any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally could delay our ability to ship our products, which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We maintain a company-wide quality and environmental program. Our San Jose operations achieved ISO 9001:1994 certification in 1996 and ISO 14001:1996 certification in March 2001. Our San Jose ISO 9001 certification was upgraded to the ISO 9001:2000 standard in January 2002, and to the ISO 9001:2008 standard in June 2010. Our San Jose ISO 14001 certification was upgraded to the ISO 14001:2004 standard in June 2006. Our ISO 9001 and 14001 certifications were expanded to our Singapore operation in August 2011. All certifications have been maintained uninterrupted through the date of this report.
Competition
The capital equipment industry in which we operate is intensely competitive. A substantial investment is required to install and integrate capital equipment into a semiconductor, semiconductor packaging or nanotechnology device production line. We believe that once a device manufacturer or packaging subcontractor has selected a particular supplier’s capital equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for the specific production line application and, to the extent possible, subsequent generations of similar products. Accordingly, it is difficult to achieve significant sales to a particular customer once another supplier’s capital equipment has been selected as they are relying on reduced cost of ownership solutions and a decision by a customer to change solutions could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results.

Advanced Packaging and HBLED Lithography

We experience competition in the advanced packaging lithography market from various reduction steppers and proximity and projection aligner companies such as Canon Incorporated, Nikon Corporation (“Nikon”), Suss Microtec AG (“Suss Microtec”), Rudolph Technologies, Inc. (“Rudolph”), Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment Co., Ltd (“SMEE”), ORC Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Ushio and from third party re-sale of used projection systems. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved price and performance characteristics. This could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our steppers in our served markets, and thereby materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Enhancements to, or future generations of, competing products may be developed that offer superior cost of ownership and technical performance features. We believe that to be competitive, we will require significant financial resources to continue to invest in new product development, to invest in new features and enhancements to existing products, to introduce new generation stepper systems in our served markets on a timely basis, and to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide. In marketing our products, we may also face competition from suppliers employing other technologies. In addition, increased competitive pressure has led to intensified price-based competition in certain of our markets, resulting in lower prices and margins. Should these competitive trends continue, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.
Our primary competition in the HBLED lithography market comes from contact, proximity and projection aligners offered by companies such as Suss Microtec, Ushio and EV Group, by stepper companies such as SMEE, as well as by third party sales of used reduction steppers including Nikon and ASML. Although contact, proximity aligners, and used reduction steppers generally have lower purchase prices than new 1X steppers, 1X steppers offer lower operating costs and favorable total cost of ownership in most applications. We believe that most device and HBLED manufacturers choose 1X steppers for the yield improvement and lower modification costs offered by the use of non-contact projection lithography.
Laser Thermal Processing

 9

With respect to our laser annealing technologies, marketed under the LSA product name, our primary competition comes from companies such as SCREEN Semiconductor Solutions Co., Ltd., Applied Materials, Inc. (“Applied Materials”) and Mattson Technology. Many of these companies also offer products utilizing RTP, which is the dominant manufacturing technology for devices above 65nm. The dopant diffusion in the lateral dimension resulting from the time scales associated with RTP limits the scaling of transistors to advanced technology nodes. Shorter annealing times result in shallower and more abrupt junctions and faster transistors. We believe that RTP manufacturers recognize the need to reduce thermal budgets and are working toward this goal. Several companies offer annealing tools that incorporate flash lamp anneal (“FLA”) technology, a potential advanced annealing solution, in order to reduce annealing times and increase anneal temperatures. This technique, which employs flash lamps, has shown improvements over RTP in junction depth and sheet resistance, but we believe FLA suffers from pattern-related non-uniformities and could require additional, costly processes to equalize the reflectivity of different areas within the chip or wafer. Our proprietary laser thermal processing solution has been specifically developed to provide junction annealing on near-instantaneous timescales, while achieving high activation levels, and doing so very uniformly across the chip and within the wafer due to our unique long wavelength technology. LSA, our first implementation of laser thermal processing, activates dopants in the microsecond-to-millisecond time frame without melting. Our research indicates that, at temperatures just below the melting point of silicon time durations in the microsecond to millisecond range are required to achieve full activation, with minimal dopant diffusion.

In July 2000, we licensed certain rights to our then existing laser thermal processing technology, with reservations, to a competing manufacturer of semiconductor equipment. This company and others currently offer laser annealing tools to the semiconductor industry that compete with our offerings.
Inspection
Competition for the Superfast inspection systems comes from a wide range of companies, including large companies such as KLA-Tencor, as well as numerous smaller companies developing and manufacturing inspection equipment such as Nanometrics, Rudolph, Frontier Semiconductor (FSM) and Nova Measuring Instruments. Similarly, there is an extremely wide range of technologies and approaches used by the competitors. Each individual technology will have advantages for certain specific inspection applications. In general, these competitors offer systems that inspect and measure at one location on the wafer, or one data point, at a time. This can limit overall data density to only a few hundred data points per wafer, as well as limit throughput. In addition, these competitive systems often require dedicated targets, pads or other special features in order to make a measurement, making them less flexible in production environments.

Although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other measures, we believe that our success will depend more upon the innovation, technological expertise and marketing abilities of our employees. Nevertheless, we have a policy of seeking patents when appropriate on inventions resulting from our ongoing research and development and manufacturing activities. Our intellectual property portfolio contains 1,248 patents and patent applications. We have patent expiration dates ranging from April 2017 to June 2035. In addition, we also have various registered trademarks and copyright registrations covering mainly applications used in the operation of our systems. We also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. We may not be able to protect our technology adequately and competitors may be able to develop similar technology independently. Our pending patent applications may not be issued or U.S. or foreign intellectual property laws may not protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement. Such litigation has resulted in, and in the future could result in, substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of the outcome of the litigation. Patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and the rights granted thereunder may not provide competitive advantages to us. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar technology or products, or, if patents are issued to us, design around the patents issued to us. Invalidation of our patents related to those technologies, or the expiration of patents covering our key technologies, could allow our competitors to more effectively compete against us, which could result in less revenue for us.
Environmental Regulations
We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances. We believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such regulations and that we have obtained all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in substantial fines being imposed 
 10

on us, suspension of production, and alteration of the manufacturing process or cessation of operations. In order to comply with such regulations, we may be required to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur substantial expenses. Any failure by us to control the use, disposal or storage of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous or toxic substances could subject us to significant liabilities.
Customers, Applications and Markets
We sell our systems to semiconductor, advanced packaging, HBLED, MEMS and various other nanotechnology manufacturers located throughout North America, Europe and Asia. We sell our ALD systems to universities and research institutes throughout the world. Semiconductor manufacturers have purchased the 1000 Series steppers, the AP series of steppers, the NanoTech steppers, the LSA systems or the Superfast systems for the fabrication and/or packaging of microprocessors, applications processors, microcontrollers, DRAMs, ASICs and a host of other devices. Such systems could be used in mix-and-match applications with other production tools, such as for replacements of contact proximity printers for flip chip applications, and for high volume capacity production.
On a market application basis, sales to the semiconductor industry, primarily for advanced packaging and laser thermal processing applications, accounted for approximately 93% of systems revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 84% and 81% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately 7%, 16% and 19%, respectively, of our systems revenue was derived from sales to nanotechnology manufacturers, including LED and MEMS manufacturers. Our future results of operations and financial position would be materially adversely impacted by a downturn in any of these industries, or by loss of market share in any of these industries.
International sales accounted for approximately 87%, 81% and 68% of total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with Asia representing 79%, 70% and 56% of total net sales for those same years and Europe representing 8%, 11% and 12% of total net sales for those same years, respectively. 
Sales of our systems depend, in significant part, upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase manufacturing capacity or to restructure current manufacturing facilities, either of which typically involves a significant commitment of capital. Many of our customers in the past have cancelled or postponed the development of new manufacturing facilities and have substantially reduced their capital equipment budgets. In view of the significant investment involved in a system purchase, we have experienced and may continue to experience delays following initial qualification of our systems as a result of delays in a customer’s approval process. Additionally, we are presently receiving orders for some systems that have lengthy delivery schedules, which may be due to longer production lead times or a result of customers’ capacity scheduling requirements. For these and other reasons, our systems typically have a lengthy sales cycle during which we may expend substantial funds and management effort in securing a sale. Lengthy sales cycles subject us to a number of significant risks, including inventory obsolescence and fluctuations in operating results, over which we have little or no control. In order to maintain or exceed our present level of net sales, we are dependent upon obtaining orders for systems that will ship and be accepted in the current period. We may not be able to obtain those orders.
Backlog
We schedule production of our systems based upon order backlog, informal customer commitments and general economic forecasts for our targeted markets. We include in our backlog all accepted customer orders for our systems with assigned shipment dates within one year, as well as all orders for service, spare parts and upgrades, in each case, that management believes to be firm. However, all orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalties. Because of changes in system delivery schedules, cancellations of orders and potential delays in system shipments, our backlog at any particular date may not necessarily be representative of actual sales for any succeeding period. As of December 31, 2016, our backlog was approximately $77.2 million, including $1.9 million of products shipped but not yet installed. As of December 31, 2015, our backlog was approximately $67.6 million, including $1.3 million of products shipped but not yet installed. Cancellation, deferrals or rescheduling of orders by these customers would have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations.
Employees
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 312 full-time employees, including 80 engaged in research, development and engineering, 31 in sales and marketing, 96 in customer service and support, 61 in manufacturing and 44 in general administration and finance. We believe our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have, however, entered 
 11

into employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.

ITEM IA. | RISK FACTORS

In addition to risks described in the foregoing discussions under “Business,” including but not limited to those under “Products,” “Research, Development and Engineering,” “Sales and Service,” “Manufacturing,” “Competition,” “Intellectual Property Rights,” “Environmental Regulations,” “Customers, Applications and Markets,” “Backlog,” and “Employees,” the following risks apply to our business and us:
The semiconductor industry historically has been highly cyclical and has experienced periods of oversupply and technology changes, which have in turn affected the market for semiconductor equipment such as ours and which can adversely affect our results of operations during such periods.
Our business depends in significant part upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors, advanced packaging semiconductors and nanotechnology components which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for such devices and products utilizing such devices. The semiconductor industry historically has been highly cyclical and has experienced recurring periods of oversupply and technology changes. This has, from time to time, resulted in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment and pricing pressure, including on the systems manufactured and marketed by us, and uncertainty among our customers. We believe that markets for new generations of semiconductors, semiconductor packaging and inspection will also be subject to similar fluctuations. Our business and operating results would be materially adversely affected by downturns or slowdowns in the semiconductor packaging market or by loss of market share. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve or maintain our current or prior level of sales. We attempt to mitigate the risk of cyclicality by participating in multiple markets including semiconductor, semiconductor packaging, semiconductor inspection and nanotechnology sectors as well as diversifying into new markets. We believe that diversifying into new markets such as laser-based annealing for implant activation, lithography steppers for 3-D packaging, HBLED, ALD and inspection can help mitigate the effects of this cyclicality in our industry. Despite such efforts, when one or more of such markets fails to become viable as we anticipate or experience an oversupply or downturn, our net sales and operating results are materially adversely affected. For example, we have experienced less revenue from laser processing as a result of the semiconductor logic foundries’ inability to effectively increase yields in 3-D FinFET devices to a level required to invest in their production ramp and unpredictability in other markets that we serve. Customers who manufacture both logic and memory devices are expected to focus their capital spending on the memory sector at this time. We believe that as a result of cyclicality and of other factors affecting our foundry customers, such as shifting customer demand, lower capacity utilization rates and changing product designs, we have and we will continue to experience reduced sales, the push out of orders to us and uncertainty in our business.
Our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict.
Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. We manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed. As a result, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue or a change in margins or product mix can have a significant impact on our operating results in any particular quarter. Forecast uncertainty also makes it difficult for us to manage inventory levels. Factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:

• | market conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industries;

 12


• | failure of suppliers to perform in a manner consistent with our expectations;


• | customer cancellations or push-outs or delays in orders, shipments, installations and/or system acceptances;


• | competitive factors, including customers selecting competitors’ products, the introduction of new products by our competitors or any failure of our products to gain or maintain market acceptance;


• | changes in selling prices and product mix;


• | manufacturing difficulties or delays; and


• | product performance issues.

We are dependent on our key personnel, especially Mr. Zafiropoulo, our Chief Executive Officer, and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected if we were to lose our key employees.
Our future operating results depend, in significant part, upon the continued contributions of key personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace. We have entered into employment agreements only with our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and our employees are employed “at will.” The agreements with our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer contain vesting acceleration and severance payment provisions that could result in significant costs or charges to us should the employee be terminated without cause, die or become disabled. We do not maintain any life insurance on any of our key employees. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our future operating results depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified management, manufacturing, technical, sales and support personnel for our operations. There are only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire such personnel over time. At times, competition for such personnel has been intense, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where we maintain our headquarters and principal operations, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. The failure to attract or retain such persons would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
There are risks and uncertainties associated with the Merger with Veeco.
The Merger, whether or not consummated, may result in a loss of our key personnel and may disrupt our sales and marketing or other key business activities, including our relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our financial performance. Our business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Merger, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and, following the completion of the Merger, those of the combined company. Additionally, we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial financial advisory, legal, and other professional fees and expenses in connection with the Merger, which we must pay regardless of whether the Merger is completed. These payments will negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
Parties with which we do business may be uncertain as to the effects on them from the Merger and the related transactions, including their current or future business relationships with us or the combined company.  These relationships may be subject to disruption, as customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we have business relationships may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us, or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us or the combined company.  These disruptions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position or those of the combined company following the completion of the Merger. The risk, and adverse effect, of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.    

The closing of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement by an affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, (with respect to which the U.S. Federal Trade Commission granted early termination on February 17, 2017); the absence of any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment issued by any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger. In addition, it is a condition to closing of the Merger that the Company and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, have at least $180 million of cash on hand held in the United States. These conditions are described in more detail in the Merger Agreement, which has been filed as Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 3, 2017. There is no assurance that all of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement will be satisfied or waived to the extent permitted by applicable law or that the Merger will occur when or as expected. If the Merger is not completed, the 
 13

share price of our common stock could decline, for reasons including the loss of the premium over the pre-announcement market price of our common stock that was to be paid upon consummation of the Merger.

 Under certain circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement, upon termination of the Merger Agreement by us or Veeco, we may be required to pay to Veeco a termination fee of $26.5 million, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
Some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and increased competition could adversely impact sales of our products and our gross margins.
We are a comparatively small company in the highly competitive semiconductor equipment industry where we face competition from a number of companies, many of which are larger and have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing, research and development, marketing and customer support resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of new products that are competitive with our products, which could negatively impact sales of our systems. Moreover, there has been merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors. These transactions may result in our competitors accumulating an increased amount of resources allowing them to bring to market a portfolio of products and achieve a competitive “product grouping strategy” advantage over us. As a result, there is no assurance that we will continue to achieve market share at a desirable gross margin.
We operate in a highly competitive industry in which customers are required to invest substantial resources in each product, which makes it difficult to achieve significant sales to a particular customer once another vendor’s equipment has been purchased by that customer.
The capital equipment industry in which we operate is intensely competitive. A substantial investment is required to install and integrate capital equipment into a semiconductor, semiconductor inspection, semiconductor packaging or nanotechnology device production line. Advanced technologies have also tended to become more capital intensive. 
We believe that once a device manufacturer or packaging subcontractor has selected a particular supplier’s capital equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for the specific production line application and, to the extent possible, subsequent generations of similar products. Accordingly, it is difficult to achieve significant sales to a particular customer once another supplier’s capital equipment has been selected.

We experience competition in advanced packaging from various proximity aligner and stepper companies such as Canon Incorporated, Nikon Corporation, ORC Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Rudolph, SMEE, Suss Microtec, Ushio as well as from the secondary market from used projection and reduction stepper systems. In nanotechnology, we experience competition from contact, proximity and projection aligner companies, such as Nikon Engineering, SMEE, Suss Microtec and Ushio as well as other third party stepper suppliers. We expect our competitors in the lithography arena to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved price and performance characteristics. This could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our steppers in our served markets, and thereby materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Enhancements to, or future generations of, competing products may be developed that offer superior cost of ownership and technical performance features.
With respect to our laser annealing technologies, marketed under the LSA101 and LSA201 product names, our primary millisecond anneal competition comes from companies such as SCREEN Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Applied Materials and Mattson Technology, Inc. Some of these companies offer products utilizing RTP, which is the current prevailing manufacturing technology. RTP does not prevent semiconductor device manufacturers from scaling the lateral dimensions of their transistors to obtain improved performance, but diffusion resulting from the time scales associated with RTP limits the vertical dimension of the junctions. Faster annealing times result in shallower and more abrupt junctions and faster transistors. We believe that RTP manufacturers and semiconductor companies recognize the need to reduce thermal cycle times and are working toward this goal. In July 2000, we licensed certain rights to our then existing laser thermal processing technology, with reservations, to a competing manufacturer of semiconductor equipment. We presently anticipate that this company and others intend to offer laser annealing tools to the semiconductor industry that will compete with our offerings.
Another potential advanced annealing solution utilizes flash lamp annealing technology, or “FLA.” Several companies have published papers on annealing tools that incorporate flash lamp technology in order to reduce annealing times and increase annealing temperatures. Developers of FLA technology claim to have overcome annealing difficulties at the advanced nodes. This technique, which employs flash lamps, has shown improvements over RTP in junction depth and sheet resistance, but we believe FLA suffers from pattern-related non-uniformities and could require additional, costly processes to equalize the reflectivity of different areas within the chip or wafer. Our proprietary laser thermal processing solution has been specifically 
 14

developed to provide junction annealing on near-instantaneous time-scales, while achieving high activation levels. Laser thermal annealing, our first implementation of laser thermal processing, activates dopants in the microsecond-to-millisecond time frame without melting. Our research indicates that, at temperatures just below the melting point of silicon, time durations in the microsecond to millisecond range, are required to achieve full activation, and minimal dopant diffusion.
Additionally, competition to our laser thermal processing products may come from other laser annealing tools, including those presently being used by the flat panel display industry to re-crystallize silicon. Manufacturers of these tools may try to extend the use of their technologies to semiconductor device applications.
In the market for inspection systems, competition for inspection systems comes from a wide range of companies, including large companies such as KLA-Tencor, Nanometrics, Rudolph, and numerous smaller companies developing and manufacturing inspection equipment.
We believe that in order to be competitive, we will need to continue to invest significant financial resources in new product development, new features and enhancements to existing products, the introduction of new stepper systems in our served markets on a timely basis, and maintaining customer service and support centers worldwide. In marketing our products, we may also face competition from vendors employing other technologies. In addition, increased competitive pressure has led to intensified price-based competition in certain of our markets, resulting in lower prices and margins. Should these competitive trends continue, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.
Our sales cycle is typically lengthy and involves a significant commitment of capital by our customers, which has subjected us, and is likely to continue to subject us, to delays in system acceptances of our products and other risks, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations by, among other things, delaying recognition of revenue with respect to those orders and resulting in increased installation, qualification and similar costs.
Sales of our systems depend, in significant part, upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase manufacturing capacity, replace older equipment or to restructure current manufacturing facilities, any of which typically involves a significant commitment of capital. Many of our customers in the past have canceled or postponed the development of new manufacturing facilities and have substantially reduced their capital equipment budgets. Many of our largest customers currently face uncertainty in the markets they serve, resulting in delays in placing new orders, the push out of previous orders to us and uncertainty in our business. 
In view of the significant investment involved in a system purchase, we have experienced and may continue to experience unexpected delays following initial qualification of our systems as a result of delays in a customer’s approval process. Additionally, we are presently receiving orders for systems that have lengthy delivery schedules, which may be due to longer production lead times or a result of customers’ capacity scheduling requirements. For these and other reasons, our systems typically have a lengthy sales cycle during which we may expend substantial funds and management effort in securing a sale. Lengthy sales cycles subject us to a number of significant risks, including inventory obsolescence and fluctuations in operating results, over which we have little or no control. In order to maintain or exceed our present level of net sales, we are dependent upon obtaining orders for systems that will ship and be accepted in the current period. We may not be able to obtain those orders. Other important factors that could cause demand for our products to fluctuate include:

• | competitive pressures, including pricing pressures, from companies that have competing products;


• | our customers’ or prospective customers’ perception of one or more of our board members;


• | changes in customer product needs or product preferences; and


• | strategic actions taken by our competitors.

Our stock price has experienced significant volatility in the past and we expect this to continue in the future as a result of many factors, some of which could be unrelated to our operating performance, and such volatility can have a major impact on the number of shares subject to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units that are included in calculating our earnings per share.
We believe that factors such as announcements of developments related to our business, fluctuations in our operating results, a shortfall in revenue or earnings, changes in our or analysts’ expectations, general conditions in the semiconductor and nanotechnology industries or the worldwide or regional economies, sales of our securities into the marketplace, our share repurchase program, an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, announcements of technological innovations or new products or enhancements by us or our competitors, developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially. 
 15

The market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect it to continue to experience significant fluctuations in the future, including fluctuations that may be unrelated to our performance.
As of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding options to purchase and outstanding restricted stock units for a total of 3.0 million shares of our common stock. Among other determinants, the market price of our stock has a major impact on the number of shares subject to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units that are included in the weighted-average shares used in determining our net income per share. During periods of extreme volatility, the impact of higher stock prices can have a materially dilutive effect on our net income per share. Additionally, shares subject to outstanding options and restricted stock units are excluded from the calculation of net income per share when we have a net loss or when the exercise price and the average unrecognized compensation cost of the stock option or restricted stock unit is greater than the average market price of our common stock, as the impact of the stock options or restricted stock units would be anti-dilutive.
Our previously announced share repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.
Repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness. Furthermore, the program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time and any suspension or discontinuation could cause the market price of our stock to decline.
We sell our products primarily to a limited number of customers and to customers in a limited number of industries, which subjects us to increased risks related to the business performance of our customers, and therefore their need for our products, and the business cycles of the markets into which we sell.
Historically, we have sold a substantial portion of our systems to a limited number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (“TSMC”), United Microelectronics Corporation, Powertech Technology, Inc. and Semiconductor Manufacturing North China (Beijing) Corporation (“SMNC”) accounted for 30%, 13%, 13% and 11% of our total systems sales, respectively. For the year ended, December 31, 2015, Siliconware Precision Industries Co. Ltd. (“SPIL”), TSMC and Intel Corporation (“Intel”) accounted for 21%, 13% and 10% of our system sales, respectively. We expect that sales to a relatively few customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future and believe that our financial results depend in significant part upon the success of these major customers and our ability to meet their future capital equipment needs. Although the composition of the group comprising our largest customers may vary from period to period, the loss of a significant customer or any reduction or delay in orders by a significant customer, including reductions or delays due to market, economic or competitive conditions in the semiconductor, semiconductor packaging, semiconductor inspection or nanotechnology industries or in the industries that manufacture products utilizing integrated circuits, thin film heads or other nanotechnology components, would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to maintain or increase our sales in the future depends, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from new customers as well as the financial condition and success of our existing customers, the semiconductor and nanotechnology industries and the economy in general.
In addition to the business risks associated with dependence on a few major customers, these significant customer concentrations have in the past resulted in significant concentrations of accounts receivable. These significant and concentrated receivables expose us to additional risks, including the risk of default by one or more customers representing a significant portion of our total receivables. If we were required to take additional accounts receivable reserves, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.
On a market application basis, sales to the semiconductor industry, primarily for advanced packaging applications and laser thermal processing applications, accounted for 93% of our systems revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 84% for the year ended December 31 2015. We sold $11.6 million of systems to nanotechnology manufacturers, including micro systems, thin film head, ALD and optical device manufacturers for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $18.2 million in sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Systems revenue from the nanotechnology sector accounted for 7% of systems revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 16% revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our future operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely impacted by a downturn in any of these industries, or by loss of market share in any of these industries. A growing percentage of our backlog 
 16

of system orders is comprised of laser thermal processing tools. As our laser thermal processing tools are used for the continuation of reduced device geometries and customers seldom provide us with their future technical requirements, these tools may not meet all customers’ requirements upon initial delivery and installation at the customer’s facility. As a result, system acceptance of the tool could be delayed while we perform testing and attempt to meet their requirements, or the order could be cancelled if we are unable to meet those requirements. Should significant demand not materialize, due to technical, production, market or other factors, our business, financial position and results of operations would be materially adversely impacted.
We rely on a limited number of outside suppliers and subcontractors to manufacture certain components and subassemblies, and on single or a limited group of outside suppliers for certain materials for our products, which could result in a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components due to quality problems, the suppliers’ failure or inability to provide such components in a timely manner, or at all, and reduced control over pricing and timely delivery of components and materials, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations.
Our manufacturing activities consist of assembling and testing components and subassemblies, which are then integrated into finished systems. We rely on a limited number of outside suppliers and subcontractors to manufacture certain components and subassemblies. We order one of the most critical components of our technology, the glass for our 1X lenses, from external suppliers. We design the 1X lenses and provide the lens specifications and the glass to other suppliers, who then grind and polish the lens elements. We then assemble and test the optical 1X lenses.
We procure some of our other critical systems’ components, subassemblies and services from single outside suppliers or a limited group of outside suppliers in order to ensure overall quality and timeliness of delivery. Many of these components and subassemblies have significant production lead times. To date, we have been able to obtain adequate services and supplies of components and subassemblies for our systems in a timely manner. However, disruption or termination of certain of these sources could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to manufacture our systems. In addition, our failure to timely use components in our manufacturing processes due to delays or cancellation of orders or quality problems requiring us to return components may lead to write downs of inventory. A disruption in supply or inventory window would, in turn, cause us to miss or delay shipments and would increase costs causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our reliance on a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers and our reliance on subcontractors involve several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components due to the suppliers’ failure or inability to provide such components in a timely manner, to our quality standards, or at all, and reduced control over pricing and timely delivery of components. Manufacture of certain of these components and subassemblies is an extremely complex process, and long lead-times are required. Any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally could delay our ability to ship our products, which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our industry is subject to rapid technological change and product innovation, which could result in our technologies and products being replaced by those of our competitors, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.
The semiconductor and nanotechnology manufacturing industries are subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements. Our ability to be competitive in these and other markets will depend, in part, upon our ability to develop new and enhanced systems and related applications, and to introduce these systems and related applications at competitive prices and on a timely and cost-effective basis to enable customers to integrate them into their operations either prior to or as they begin volume product manufacturing. We will also be required to enhance the performance of our existing systems and related applications. Our success in developing new and enhanced systems and related applications depends upon a variety of factors, including product selection, timely and efficient completion of product design, timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, product performance in the field and effective sales and marketing. Product failures may result in customer dissatisfaction, high service and support costs, rework and increased inventory. Because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales, new product decisions must anticipate both future customer requirements and the technology that will be available to meet those requirements. We may not be successful in selecting, developing, manufacturing or marketing new products and related applications or enhancing our existing products and related applications. Any such failure would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we have in the past and may in the future make substantial investments in new products before we know whether they are technically feasible or commercially viable, and as a result may incur significant product development expenses that do not result in new products or revenues.
 17

Because of the large number of components in our systems, significant delays can occur between a system’s introduction and our commencement of volume production of such systems. We have experienced delays from time to time in the introduction of, and technical and manufacturing difficulties with, certain of our systems and enhancements and related application tools features and options, and may experience delays and technical and manufacturing difficulties in future introductions or volume production of new systems or enhancements and related application tools features and options.
We may encounter additional technical, manufacturing or other difficulties that could further delay future introductions or volume production of systems or enhancements. Our inability to complete the development or meet the technical specifications of any of our systems or enhancements and related applications, or our inability to manufacture and ship these systems or enhancements and related tools in volume and in time to meet the requirements for manufacturing the future generation of semiconductor or nanotechnology devices would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may incur substantial unanticipated costs to ensure the functionality and reliability of our products early in the products’ life cycles. If new products have reliability or quality problems, reduced orders or higher manufacturing costs, delays in system acceptance, revenue recognition and collecting accounts receivable and additional service and warranty expenses may result. Any of such events may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We currently spend, and expect to continue to spend, significant resources to develop, introduce and commercialize our offered products and future generations of, and enhancements to these products. We may not be successful in the timely introduction of these products which may cause sales of these products to decrease or not increase as expected.
Currently, we are devoting significant resources to the development, introduction and commercialization of our laser thermal processing systems, and other products, and future generations of, and enhancements to, those products. We intend to continue to develop these products and technologies, and will continue to incur significant operating expenses in the areas of research, development and engineering, manufacturing and general and administrative costs in order to develop, produce and support these new products and enhancements. There can be no assurance that our expenditures to develop these products will result in improved sales or that markets for these products will become viable. Additionally, gross profit margins and inventory levels may be further adversely impacted in the future by costs associated with the initial production of new products. Introduction of new products generally involves higher installation costs and product performance uncertainties that could delay system acceptance of our systems, resulting in a delay in recognizing revenue associated with those systems and a reduction in gross margins. These costs include, but are not limited to, additional manufacturing overhead, additional inventory write-downs, costs of demonstration systems and facilities and costs associated with the establishment of additional after-sales support organizations. Additionally, operating expenses may increase, relative to sales, as a result of adding additional marketing and administrative personnel, among other costs, to support our new products. If we are unable to achieve significantly increased net sales or if our sales fall below expectations, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.
Our ability to commercialize our laser thermal processing technologies depends on our ability to demonstrate a manufacturing-worthy tool. We do not presently have in-house capability to fabricate devices. As a result, we must rely on partnering with semiconductor companies to develop the anneal process. The development of new process technologies is largely dependent upon our ability to interest potential customers in working on developing a process and providing timely and detailed feedback for system development. Our ability to deliver timely solutions is also limited by our customers understanding and communication of the future anneal requirements. 
Changes in financial accounting standards or policies in the past have affected, and in the future may affect, our reported results of operations.
We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions which are completed before a change is announced.
Accounting policies affecting many other aspects of our business, including rules relating to revenue recognition, off-balance sheet transactions, employee stock options and other equity awards, restructuring, asset disposals and asset retirement obligations, derivative and other financial instruments are regularly under review and subject to revision. Changes to those rules or the questioning of how we interpret or implement those rules may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business. In addition, our preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of those assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the recorded amounts of expenses during the reporting 
 18

period. A change in the facts and circumstances surrounding those estimates could result in a change to our estimates and could impact our future operating results.
Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health issues, political instability, wars, and other military action, as well as terrorist attacks and threats and government responses thereto, especially if any such actions were directed at us or our facilities or customers.
Public health issues, political instability, natural disasters, terrorist attacks in the United States and elsewhere, and government responses thereto, may disrupt our operations or those of our customers and suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers. In addition, such events could disrupt the semiconductor market, resulting in the cancellation or delay of product orders. Significant public health issues could cause damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties that may have a significant negative impact on the global economy, us and our customers or suppliers. Should such incidents increase or other public health issues arise, we could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions and disruptions in the operations of our customers or suppliers. Similarly, political instability could affect the ability of our suppliers to provide the materials needed in our operations or the cost of acquiring such materials. Any public health issues, political instability, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, or the ongoing war on terrorism or other wars could increase volatility in the United States and world financial markets which may depress the price of our common stock and may limit the capital resources available to us or our customers or suppliers, which could result in decreased orders from customers, less favorable financing terms from suppliers, and scarcity or increased costs of materials and components of our products. Additionally, if any of these events were to directly affect or be specifically directed at us, or occur in a country where we or our suppliers or our customers operate, our ability to conduct our business could be significantly disrupted. Any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results, revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility of the market price of our common stock.
We currently perform a significant amount of our manufacturing activities in cleanroom environments in San Jose, California, an area known for seismic activity. Performing manufacturing operations in California exposes us to a higher risk of natural disasters, including earthquakes. In addition, in the past California has experienced power shortages, which have interrupted our operations. Such shortages could occur in the future. Further, our suppliers and/or customers may operate in areas subject to natural disasters, the occurrence of which could affect their ability to continue to do business with us as expected or at all. An earthquake, other natural disaster, power shortage or other similar events could interrupt or otherwise limit our operations or those of our suppliers or customers resulting in product shipment delays, supply problems, cancellations or deferrals of product orders, increased costs and other problems, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, customer relationships and results of operations.
We continue to expand our manufacturing and service operations in Singapore and customer support operations in other parts of the world, which will continue to result in exposure to risks inherent in doing business outside the United States, any of which risks could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.
Foreign operations subject us to risks related to the political, economic, legal and other conditions of foreign jurisdictions. These risks include risks related to:

• | foreign exchange rate fluctuations;


• | the need to comply with foreign government laws and regulations, including the imposition of regulatory requirements, tariffs, and import and export restrictions;


• | general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;


• | the need for effective management of dispersed operations far from our headquarters in California;


• | the potential for strain on management resources;


• | difficulty in hiring and retaining local personnel for the successful operation of our business in each location;


• | the need to effectively manage personnel in different languages and under different cultural and legal expectations and requirements in certain locations;


• | meeting growth objectives and employment projections;


• | potentially less protection of intellectual property under the laws of foreign jurisdictions in certain locations; and


• | public safety or health concerns or natural disasters in foreign countries.

 19

These risks could, among other things, result in product shipment delays, increased costs, unexpected shutdowns or other business disruptions, or loss of benefits expected to be achieved by conducting operations in affected jurisdictions. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
A substantial portion of our sales are outside of the United States, which subjects us to risks related to customer service, installation, foreign economic and political stability, uncertain regulatory and tax rules, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, all of which make it more difficult to operate our business.
International sales accounted for approximately 87% of total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 81% for the year ended December 31, 2015. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of total net sales. Although we generally transact our international sales in U.S. dollars, international sales expose us to a number of additional risk factors, including fluctuations in the value of local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which, in turn, impact the relative cost of ownership of our products and may further impact the purchasing ability of our international customers. We have direct sales operations in Japan and orders are often denominated in Japanese yen. This may subject us to a higher degree of risk from currency fluctuations. We attempt to mitigate this exposure through foreign currency hedging. We are also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of semiconductors and nanotechnology products. We cannot predict whether the United States or any other country will implement changes to quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products. These factors, or the adoption of restrictive policies, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, by having a significant portion of our sales occur internationally, we are continually exposed to political and economic instability; difficulties in accounts receivable collections; reduced protection of intellectual property; natural disasters; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations; and potentially adverse tax consequences.
To better align with the increasingly international nature of our business, we transitioned certain manufacturing processes to Singapore, thereby bringing these activities closer to our Asia-based customers. This movement is somewhat recent and our experience in international manufacturing operations is not as extensive as in the U.S. If we are unable to continue to successfully operate the site to efficiently manufacture systems, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.
If we acquire companies, products, or technologies, we may face risks associated with those acquisitions.
We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, personnel and products of the acquired companies; the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience; and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company. In the event we acquire product lines, technologies or businesses which do not complement our business, or which otherwise do not enhance our sales or operating results, we may incur substantial write-offs and higher recurring operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may, in the future, pursue additional acquisitions of complementary product lines, technologies or businesses. Future acquisitions may require use of substantial amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses and impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In the event that any such acquisition does occur, there can be no assurance as to the effect thereof on our business or operating results.
Changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations.
A number of factors may negatively impact our future effective tax rates including, but not limited to:


• | the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;


• | changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;


• | increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes;


• | changes in available tax credits;


• | changes in stock-based compensation; and


• | changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the United States or other countries in which we operate.

 20

We are eligible for tax incentives that provide that certain income earned in Singapore would be subject to a tax holiday and/or reduced tax rates for a limited period of time under the laws of Singapore. Our ability to realize benefits from these initiatives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met, the incentives are substantially modified, or if we incur losses for which we cannot take a deduction.

We may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights or we could be found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, either of which could weaken our competitive position and adversely affect our results of operations.
Although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other measures, we believe that our success will depend more upon the innovation, technological expertise and marketing abilities of our employees. Nevertheless, we have a policy of seeking patents when appropriate on inventions resulting from our ongoing research and development and manufacturing activities. Our intellectual property portfolio has 1,248 patents and patent applications with expiration dates ranging from April 2017 to June 2035. In addition, we have various registered trademarks and copyright registrations covering mainly applications used in the operation of our systems. We also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. We may not be able to protect our technology adequately and competitors may be able to develop similar technology independently. Our pending patent applications may not be issued or U.S. or foreign intellectual property laws may not protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement. Such litigation has resulted in, and in the future could result in, substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of the outcome of the litigation. Patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and the rights granted thereunder may not provide competitive advantages to us. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar technology or products, or, if patents are issued to us, design around the patents issued to us. Invalidation of our patents related to those technologies, or the expiration of patents covering our key technologies, could allow our competitors to more effectively compete against us, which could result in less revenue for us.
We have from time to time been notified of claims that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties. We believe that the outcome of these matters will not be material to our business, results of operations or financial condition. Infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims may be asserted in the future and such assertions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of the outcome of any litigation. With respect to any such future claims, we may seek to obtain a license under the third party’s intellectual property rights. However, a license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. We could decide, in the alternative, to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be expensive and time consuming and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of the outcome of any litigation.
We use hazardous substances in the operation of our business, and any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations or to appropriately control the use, disposal or storage of such substances could subject us to significant liabilities.
We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to environment protection and workplace safety, including the use, storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances. The failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in substantial fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, alteration of the manufacturing process or cessation of operations. Such regulations could require us to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur substantial expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure by us to comply with these regulations, including any failure to control the use, disposal or storage of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous or toxic substances, could subject us to significant liabilities.
Our investment portfolio may suffer losses from changes in market interest rates and changes in market conditions, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
As of December 31, 2016, we had $267.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We maintain an investment portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in commercial paper and U.S. government-backed securities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, and market and interest rate risks. Substantially all of these securities are subject to interest rate and credit risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one or more of the issuers’ credit ratings is reduced. As a result of any of the foregoing, we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments, which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and 
 21

credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes.
Our restructuring activities may not achieve the results we expect and could change, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
In 2015, we implemented restructuring activities to reduce expenses, which included a reduction in our workforce. There can be no assurance that our restructuring activities will produce the cost savings we anticipate in the expected timeframe or that the cumulative restructuring charge will not have to increase in order to achieve our cost savings targets. Any delay or failure to achieve the expected cost savings and any increase in our anticipated cumulative restructuring charge would likely cause our future earnings to be lower than anticipated.
Our equity incentive plans, certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and certain aspects of Delaware law may discourage third parties from pursuing a change of control transaction with us.
Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, equity incentive plans, licensing agreements, Bylaws and Delaware law may discourage certain transactions involving a change in control of our company. In addition to the foregoing, the shareholdings of our officers, directors and persons or entities that may be deemed affiliates and the ability of the Board of Directors to issue “blank check” preferred stock without further stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or inhibiting us from experiencing a change in control and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of holders of our common stock.
We are subject to laws, regulations and similar requirements, changes to which may adversely affect our business and operations.
We are subject to laws, regulations and similar requirements that affect our business and operations, including, but not limited to, the areas of commerce, import and export control, intellectual property, income and other taxes, anti-trust, anti-corruption, labor, environmental, health and safety. Our compliance in these areas may be costly, especially in areas where there are inconsistencies between the various jurisdictions in which we operate. While we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with various laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Any such violation or alleged violation could materially and adversely affect our business. Any changes or potential changes to laws, regulations or similar requirements, or our ability to respond to these changes, may significantly increase our costs to maintain compliance or result in our decision to limit our business, products or jurisdictions in which we operate, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operations.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes provisions regarding certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These provisions require companies to undertake due diligence procedures and reports on the use of conflict minerals in its products, including products manufactured by third parties. Compliance with these provisions will cause us to incur costs to certify that our supply chain is conflict free and we may face difficulties in complying with the law if our suppliers are unwilling or unable to verify the source of their materials. Our ability to source parts containing these metals and minerals may be adversely impacted. In addition, our customers may require that we provide them with a certification and our inability to do so may disqualify us as a supplier.
We hold cash and cash equivalents at various foreign subsidiaries that may not be readily available to meet domestic cash requirements.
Our various foreign subsidiaries hold cash and cash equivalents and as we intend to reinvest certain foreign earnings indefinitely, these balances held outside the United States may not be readily available to meet our domestic cash requirements. We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, purchases of property and equipment, and potentially for future acquisitions. If we are unable to meet our domestic cash requirements using domestic cash flows from operations, or domestic cash and cash equivalents, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that we have designated as permanently reinvested. We may also be required to repatriate cash held outside the United States to meet the closing condition of having not less than $180 million of cash on hand in the United States at the time of the closing of the Merger. The repatriation of earnings may require us to record additional income tax expense and remit additional taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
