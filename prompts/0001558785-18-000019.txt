Item 1.    Business
Overview
CVR Refining, LP and, unless the context otherwise requires, its subsidiaries ("CVR Refining," the "Partnership," "we," "us," or "our") is an independent downstream energy limited partnership with refining and related logistics assets that operates in the mid-continent region. Our common units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "CVRR."
We are a petroleum refiner and own two of only seven refineries in Group 3 of the PADD II region of the United States. We own and operate a complex full coking medium-sour crude oil refinery in Coffeyville, Kansas with a rated capacity of 115,000 bpcd and a complex crude oil refinery in Wynnewood, Oklahoma with a rated capacity of 70,000 bpcd capable of processing 20,000 bpcd of light sour crude oil (within its rated capacity of 70,000 bpcd). The combined crude capacity represents approximately 23% of the region's refining capacity. In addition, we also control and operate supporting logistics assets including (i) approximately 570 miles of active owned, leased and joint venture pipelines, (ii) approximately 130 crude oil transports, (iii) a network of strategically located crude oil gathering tank farms, (iv) approximately 6.4 million barrels of owned and leased crude oil storage, and (v) over 4.6 million barrels of combined refined products and feedstocks storage capacity. The strategic location of our refineries, combined with our supporting logistics assets, provide us with a significant crude oil cost advantage relative to our competitors. Furthermore, our Coffeyville refinery located in southeast Kansas and the Wynnewood refinery located 65 miles south of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, are approximately 100 miles and 130 miles, respectively, from the crude oil hub at Cushing, Oklahoma ("Cushing"), and have access to inland domestic and Canadian crude oils that are priced based on the price of WTI. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the crude oil consumed at the refineries was price advantaged to WTI. 
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into a joint venture, Midway Pipeline LLC ("Midway"), with a subsidiary of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. ("Plains"), which acquired the approximately 100-mile, 16-inch pipeline that connects our Coffeyville refinery to the Cushing oil hub, and we separately acquired from Plains the approximately 100-mile, 8- and 10-inch pipeline system connecting our Wynnewood refinery to Cushing. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 6 ("Equity Method Investments") of this Report for a discussion of the joint venture transaction.
Our refineries' complexity allows us to optimize the yields (the percentage of refined product that is produced from crude oil and other feedstocks) of higher value transportation fuels (gasoline and diesel). Complexity is a measure of a refinery's ability to process lower quality crude oil and feedstocks in an economic manner. Our two refineries' capacity weighted average complexity is 13.0. As a result of key investments in our refining assets and the addition of process units to comply with gasoline quality regulations, both of the refinery's complexities have increased. Our Coffeyville refinery's complexity score is 13.3, and our Wynnewood refinery's complexity score is 12.6. Our high complexity provides us the flexibility to increase our refining margin over comparable refiners with lower complexities. We have achieved significant increases in our refinery crude throughput rates over historical levels. As a result of the increasing complexities, we are capable of processing a variety of crudes, including WTS, WTI, sweet and sour Canadian, and locally gathered crudes. 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Coffeyville refinery's product yield included gasoline (50%), diesel fuel (primarily ultra-low sulfur diesel ("ULSD")) (42%), and pet coke and other refined products such as natural gas liquids ("NGLs") (propane and butane), slurry, sulfur and gas oil (8%). Our Wynnewood refinery's product yield included gasoline (51%), diesel fuel (primarily ULSD) (38%), asphalt (5%), jet fuel (4%) and other products (2%) (slurry, sulfur and gas oil, and specialty products such as propylene and solvents).
Our crude oil gathering system capacity is over 80,000 bpd currently. The gathering system allows us to gather crude oil that is purchased from independent crude oil producers in Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Missouri, Colorado and Texas, which serves our two refineries. During 2017, we gathered approximately 86,000 bpd of price-advantaged crudes from our gathering area. The system has field offices in Bartlesville and Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, Plainville and Winfield, Kansas and Denver, Colorado. Gathered crude oil provides an attractive and competitive base supply of crude oil for the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries. In aggregate, these crudes have been sourced at a discount to WTI because of our proximity to the sources of crude oil, existing logistics infrastructure and quality differences. We also have 35,000 bpd of contracted capacity on the Keystone and Spearhead pipelines that allow us to supply price-advantaged Canadian crude to our refineries. We also have contracted capacity on the Pony Express and White Cliffs pipelines, which both became in-service during 2015. Both the Pony Express and White Cliffs pipelines originate in Colorado and extend to Cushing. 
5

In addition to our gathering system, we own (i) a 170,000 bpd pipeline system that transports crude oil from our Broome Station facility to our Coffeyville refinery, (ii) approximately 1.5 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity that supports the gathering system and our Coffeyville refinery, (iii) approximately 0.9 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity at our Wynnewood refinery and (iv) approximately 1.5 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity in Cushing. We also lease additional crude oil storage capacity of approximately 2.3 million barrels in Cushing and 0.2 million barrels in Duncan, Oklahoma. The Duncan storage supports our Wynnewood refinery while the Cushing storage supports both our Wynnewood and Coffeyville refineries. 
For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we generated net sales of $5.7 billion, $4.4 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, and operating income of $203.8 million, $77.8 million and $361.7 million, respectively.
Our History
We were formed by CVR Energy in September 2012 in order to own and operate petroleum and auxiliary businesses as a limited partnership. On January 23, 2013, we completed our initial public offering of 24,000,000 common units to the public priced at $25.00 per unit, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $600.0 million. Of the common units issued, 4,000,000 units were purchased by an affiliate of Icahn Enterprises L.P. ("IEP"). Additionally, on January 30, 2013, the underwriters closed their option to purchase an additional 3,600,000 common units at a price of $25.00 per unit, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $90.0 million. The common units, which are listed on the NYSE, began trading on January 17, 2013 under the symbol "CVRR." 
As of December 31, 2017, public security holders held approximately 34% of all outstanding limited partner interests (including common units owned by affiliates of IEP, representing approximately 3.9% of all outstanding limited partner interests), and CVR Refining Holdings, LLC ("CVR Refining Holdings") held approximately 66% of all outstanding limited partner interests. In addition, CVR Refining Holdings owns 100% of the Partnership’s general partner, CVR Refining GP, which holds a non-economic general partner interest.

Crude and Feedstock Supply
Our Coffeyville refinery has the capability to process blends of a variety of crude oil ranging from heavy sour to light sweet crude oil. Currently, our Coffeyville refinery crude oil slate consists of a blend of mid-continent domestic grades, various Canadian medium and heavy sours, and North Dakota Bakken and other similarly sourced crudes. While crude oil has constituted over 90% of our Coffeyville refinery's total throughput over the last five years, other feedstock inputs include normal butane, natural gasoline, alkylation feeds, naphtha, gas oil and vacuum tower bottoms.
Our Wynnewood refinery has the capability to process blends of a variety of crude oil ranging from medium sour to light sweet crude oil, although isobutane, gasoline components, and normal butane are also typically used. Historically most of the Wynnewood refinery's crude oil has been acquired domestically, mainly from Texas and Oklahoma, but it can also access and process various light and medium Canadian grades.
Crude oil is supplied to our refineries through our wholly-owned gathering system and by owned, leased and joint venture pipelines. We have continued to increase the number of barrels of crude oil supplied through our crude oil gathering system in 2017 and it now has the capacity of supplying over 80,000 bpd of crude oil to our refineries. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the gathering system supplied approximately 44% and 49% of the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries' crude oil demand, respectively. Locally produced crude oils are delivered to the refineries at a discount to WTI, and although sometimes slightly heavier and more sour, offer good economics to the refineries. These crude oils are light and sweet enough to allow us to blend higher percentages of lower cost crude oils such as heavy sour Canadian crude oil while maintaining our target medium sour blend with an API gravity of between 28 and 36 degrees and between 0.9% and 1.2% sulfur. Crude oils sourced outside of our proprietary gathering system are delivered to Cushing by various pipelines, including the Keystone and Spearhead pipelines, and subsequently to our Broome Station facility via the Midway joint venture pipeline. Our current contracted capacity includes the Pony Express and White Cliffs pipelines, respectively. From the Broome Station facility, crude oil is delivered to our Coffeyville refinery via our own 170,000 bpd pipeline system. Crude oils are delivered to the Wynnewood refinery through third-party pipelines, the pipeline we acquired from Plains and, beginning in April 2017, through the VPP joint venture pipeline, and received into storage tanks at terminals located on or near the refinery.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Coffeyville refinery's crude oil supply blend was comprised of approximately 92% light sweet crude oil and 8% heavy sour crude oil. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Wynnewood refinery's crude oil supply blend was comprised entirely of light sweet crude oil. The light sweet crude oil supply blend includes our locally gathered crude oil.
The Coffeyville refinery is connected to the mid-continent natural gas liquids commercial hub of Conway, Kansas by the inbound Enterprise Pipeline Blue Line. Natural gas liquids feedstock supplies such as butanes and natural gasoline are sourced and delivered directly into the refinery. In addition, Coffeyville's proximity to Conway provides access to the natural gas liquid and liquid petroleum gas fractionation and storage capabilities as well as the commercial markets available at Conway.
Crude Oil Supply Agreement
Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 12 ("Commitments and Contingencies") of this Report for information on the crude oil supply agreement.
Refining Process
Coffeyville Refinery. Our Coffeyville refinery is a 115,000 bpcd rated capacity facility with operations including fractionation, catalytic cracking, hydrotreating, reforming, coking, isomerization, alkylation, sulfur recovery and propane and butane recovery. Our Coffeyville refinery benefits from significant refining unit redundancies, which include two crude oil distillation and vacuum towers, three sulfur recovery units and four hydrotreating units. These redundancies allow us to continue to receive and process crude oil even if one tower requires unplanned maintenance without having to shut down the entire refinery in the case of a major unit turnaround. In addition, our Coffeyville refinery has a redundant supply of hydrogen pursuant to our feedstock and shared services agreement with CVR Partners. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our Coffeyville refinery processed approximately 132,000 bpd and 9,000 bpd of crude oil and feedstocks and blendstocks, respectively. 
8

Wynnewood Refinery. Our Wynnewood refinery is a 70,000 bpcd rated capacity facility with operations including fractionation, cracking, hydrotreating, hydrocracking, reforming, solvent deasphalting, alkylation, sulfur recovery and propane and butane recovery. Similar to our Coffeyville refinery, our Wynnewood refinery benefits from unit redundancies, including two crude oil distillation and vacuum towers and four hydrotreating units. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our Wynnewood refinery processed approximately 73,000 bpd and 3,000 bpd of crude oil and feedstocks and blendstocks, respectively. These throughput rates for 2017 reflect the first phase of the major scheduled turnaround completed in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Marketing and Distribution
We focus our Coffeyville petroleum product marketing efforts in the central mid-continent area, because of its relative proximity to the refinery and pipeline access. Coffeyville also has access to the Rocky Mountain area. Coffeyville engages in rack marketing, which is the supply of product through tanker trucks and railcars directly to customers located in close geographic proximity to the refinery and to customers at throughput terminals on the refined products distribution systems of Magellan and NuStar. Coffeyville also makes bulk sales (sales into third-party pipelines) into the mid-continent markets and other destinations utilizing the product pipeline networks owned by Magellan, Enterprise and NuStar. The outbound Enterprise Pipeline Red Line provides Coffeyville with access to the NuStar Refined Products Pipeline system. This allows gasoline and ULSD product sales from Kansas up into North Dakota.
Our Wynnewood refinery ships its finished product via pipeline, railcar, and truck. It focuses its efforts in the southern portion of the Magellan system which covers all of Oklahoma, parts of Arkansas as well as eastern Missouri, and all other Magellan terminals. The pipeline system is also able to flow in the opposite direction, providing access to Texas markets as well as some adjoining states with pipeline connections. Wynnewood also sells jet fuel to the U.S. Department of Defense via its segregated truck rack and can offer asphalts, solvents and other specialty products via both truck and rail.
Customers
Customers for our refined petroleum products primarily include retailers, railroads and farm cooperatives and other refiners/marketers in Group 3 of the PADD II region because of their relative proximity to our refineries and pipeline access. We sell bulk products to long-standing customers at spot market prices based on a Group 3 basis differential to prices quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX"), which are reported by industry market-related indices such as Platts and Oil Price Information Service.
We also have a rack marketing business supplying product through tanker trucks directly to customers located in proximity to our Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries, as well as to customers located at throughput terminals on refined products distribution systems run by Magellan and NuStar. Rack sales are at posted prices that are influenced by competitor pricing and Group 3 spot market differentials. Additionally, our Wynnewood refinery supplies jet fuel to the U.S. Department of Defense. In addition, our Coffeyville refinery sells hydrogen and a by-product of its refining operations, such as petroleum coke, to an affiliate, CVR Partners, pursuant to separate multi-year agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, one customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 19% of our net sales while approximately 52% of our net sales were made to our ten largest customers. While we do have a high concentration of customers, we do not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and the ability to make cash distributions. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Our business depends on significant customers and the loss of several significant customers may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.
Competition
We compete primarily on the basis of price, reliability of supply, availability of multiple grades of products and location. The principal competitive factors affecting our refining operations are cost of crude oil and other feedstock costs, refinery complexity, refinery efficiency, refinery product mix and product distribution and transportation costs. The location of our refineries provides us with a reliable supply of crude oil and a transportation cost advantage over our competitors. We primarily compete against five refineries operated in the mid-continent region. In addition to these refineries, we compete against trading companies, as well as other refineries located outside the region that are linked to the mid-continent market through an extensive product pipeline system. These competitors include refineries located near the Gulf Coast and the Texas panhandle region. Our competition also includes branded, integrated and independent oil refining companies, such as Phillips 66, HollyFrontier Corporation, CHS Inc., Valero Energy Corporation and Flint Hills Resources.
9

Seasonality
Our business experiences seasonal effects as demand for gasoline products is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and road construction work. Demand for diesel fuel is higher during the planting and harvesting seasons. As a result, our results of operations for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower compared to our results for the second and third calendar quarters. In addition, unseasonably cool weather in the summer months and/or unseasonably warm weather in the winter months in the markets in which we sell our petroleum products can impact the demand for gasoline and diesel fuel. The demand for asphalt is also seasonal and is generally higher during the months of March through October.
Environmental Matters
Our businesses are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations governing the emission and release of hazardous substances into the environment, the treatment and discharge of waste water, the storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum products, and the characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels. These laws and regulations, their underlying regulatory requirements and the enforcement thereof impact our business and operations by imposing:

• | restrictions on operations or the need to install enhanced or additional controls;


• | the need to obtain and comply with permits, licenses and authorizations;


• | liability for the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at current and former facilities (if any) and for off-site waste disposal locations; and


• | specifications for the products marketed by us, primarily gasoline and diesel fuel.

Our operations require numerous permits, licenses and authorizations. Failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions or a revocation of our permits. In addition, the laws and regulations to which we are subject are often evolving and many of them have become more stringent or have become subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement by federal or state agencies. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs.
The principal environmental risks associated with our businesses are outlined below, with additional details included in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and Part II, Item 8, Note 12 ("Commitments and Contingencies") of this Report.
The Federal Clean Air Act
The federal Clean Air Act and its implementing regulations, as well as the corresponding state laws and regulations that regulate emissions of pollutants into the air, affect our operations both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts may occur through the federal Clean Air Act's permitting requirements and/or emission control requirements relating to specific air pollutants, as well as the requirement to maintain a risk management program to help prevent accidental releases of certain regulated substances. The federal Clean Air Act indirectly affects our operations by extensively regulating the air emissions of sulfur dioxide ("SO2"), volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides and other substances, including those emitted by mobile sources, which are direct or indirect users of our products.
Some or all of the standards promulgated pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act, or any future promulgations of standards, may require the installation of controls or changes to our operations in order to comply. If new controls or changes to operations are needed, the costs could be material. These new requirements, other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act, or other presently existing or future environmental regulations, could cause us to expend substantial resources to comply and/or permit our facilities to produce products that meet applicable requirements.
10

The regulation of air emissions under the federal Clean Air Act requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits and incur capital expenditures for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at our petroleum operations when regulations change or we add new equipment or modify our existing equipment. Various regulations specific to our operations have been implemented, such as National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAP"), New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") and New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("PSD"). 
On September 12, 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") published in the Federal Register final revisions to its NSPS for process heaters and flares at petroleum refineries. The EPA originally issued final standards in June 2008, but the portions of the rule relating to process heaters and flares were stayed pending reconsideration of certain provisions. The final standards regulate emissions of nitrogen oxide from process heaters and emissions of SO2 from flares, as well as require certain work practice and monitoring standards for flares. We do not believe that the costs of complying with the rule are material.
On December 1, 2015, the EPA published in the Federal Register the petroleum refining sector risk rule. The rule places additional emission control requirements and work practice standards on FCCUs, storage tanks, flares, coking units and other equipment at petroleum refineries. We do not believe that the costs of complying with the rule are material.
Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 12 ("Commitments and Contingencies") of this Report for further discussion of recent environmental matters related to the Clean Air Act including the "Flood, Crude Oil Discharge and Insurance" and certain "Environmental, Health and Safety ("EHS") Matters."
The Federal Clean Water Act
The federal Clean Water Act ("CWA") and its implementing regulations, as well as the corresponding state laws and regulations that regulate the discharge of pollutants into the water, affect our operations. Direct impacts occur through the CWA's permitting requirements, which establish discharge limitations based on technology standards, water quality standards, and restrictions on the total maximum daily load of pollutants that may be released to a particular water body based on its use. In addition, water resources are becoming and in the future may become scarcer, and many refiners, including CRRM and Wynnewood Refining Company, LLC ("WRC"), are subject to restrictions on their ability to use water in the event of low availability conditions. Both CRRM and WRC have contracts in place to receive water during certain water shortage conditions, but these conditions could change over time if water becomes scarce.
Release Reporting
The release of hazardous substances or extremely hazardous substances into the environment is subject to release reporting requirements under federal and state environmental laws. Our facilities periodically experience releases of hazardous and extremely hazardous substances. Our refineries periodically have excess emission events from flaring and other planned and unplanned start up, shutdown and malfunction events. From time to time, the EPA has conducted inspections and issued information requests to us with respect to our compliance with reporting requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. If we fail to timely or properly report a release, or if the release violates the law or our permits, it could cause us to become the subject of a governmental enforcement action or third-party claims. Government enforcement or third-party claims relating to releases of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances could result in significant expenditures and liability.
Fuel Regulations
Tier 2, Low Sulfur Fuels.  In February 2000, the EPA promulgated the Tier 2 Motor Vehicle Emission Standards Final Rule for all passenger vehicles, establishing standards for sulfur content in gasoline that were required to be met by 2006. In addition, in January 2001, the EPA promulgated its on-road diesel regulations, which required a 97% reduction in the sulfur content of diesel fuel sold for highway use by June 1, 2006, with full compliance by January 1, 2010. Our refineries are in compliance with the EPA's low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel standards.
Tier 3.  In April 2014, the EPA promulgated the Tier 3 Motor Vehicle Emission and Fuel Standards, which will require that gasoline contain no more than ten parts per million of sulfur on an annual average basis. Refineries were required to be in compliance with the more stringent emission standards as of January 1, 2017; however, compliance with the rule has been extended until January 1, 2020 for approved small volume refineries and small refiners. In June 2016, because it exceeded the EPA’s specified throughput limit for a “small volume refinery,” the Wynnewood refinery became disqualified as a “small volume refinery.” Therefore, the Wynnewood refinery’s compliance deadline was accelerated to December 21, 2018. It is not anticipated that the refineries will require additional controls or capital expenditures to meet the anticipated new standard. 
11

Mobile Source Air Toxic II Emissions 
In 2007, the EPA promulgated the Mobile Source Air Toxic II ("MSAT II") rule that required the reduction of benzene in gasoline by 2011. The MSAT II projects for CRRM and WRC were completed within the compliance deadline of November 1, 2014. Our refineries are in compliance with the EPA's MSAT II rule.
Renewable Fuel Standards 
Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, If sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase or if we have to pay a significantly higher price for RINs, or if we are otherwise unable to meet the EPA's RFS mandates, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, and Part II, Item 8, Note 12 ("Commitments and Contingencies"), "Environmental, Health and Safety ("EHS") Matters" of this Report for further discussion of the "Renewable Fuel Standards."
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Climate change laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, of this Report for further discussion of the Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") Emissions regulations. 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA")
Our operations are subject to the RCRA requirements for the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. When feasible, RCRA-regulated materials are recycled instead of being disposed of on-site or off-site. RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides governing current waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal practices, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks containing regulated substances. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 12 ("Commitments and Contingencies"), "Environmental, Health and Safety ("EHS") Matters" for further discussion of "RCRA Compliance Matters."
Waste Management.  There are two closed hazardous waste units at the Coffeyville refinery and fourteen other solid waste management units in the process of being closed pending state agency approval. There is one closed hazardous waste unit and one active hazardous waste storage tank at the Wynnewood refinery. In addition, one closed interim status hazardous waste land farm located at the now-closed Phillipsburg terminal is under long-term post closure care.
Impacts of Past Manufacturing.  In March 2004, CRRM and Coffeyville Resources Terminal, LLC ("CRT") entered into a Consent Decree ("2004 Consent Decree") with the EPA and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (the "KDHE") which required us to assume two RCRA corrective action orders issued to Farmland, the prior owner of the Coffeyville refinery. We are subject to a 1994 EPA administrative order related to investigation of possible past releases of hazardous materials to the environment at the Coffeyville refinery. In accordance with the order, we have documented existing soil and groundwater conditions, which required investigation and interim remediation projects. In June 2017, the Coffeyville refinery submitted an amended post-closure permit application to KDHE to complete closure of former hazardous waste management units at the Coffeyville refinery and to perform corrective action at the site. The now-closed Phillipsburg terminal is subject to a 1996 EPA administrative order related to investigation of releases of hazardous materials to the environment at the Phillipsburg terminal, which operated as a refinery until 1991. The Phillipsburg terminal continues to implement interim measures to address the investigation’s findings. Further remediation, if ordered necessary by the EPA or the state, will be based on the results of the investigation. The Wynnewood refinery operates under a RCRA permit. A RCRA facility investigation has been completed in accordance with the terms of the permit. Based on the facility investigation and other available information, the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality ("ODEQ") and WRC have entered into a consent order requiring further investigations of groundwater conditions and enhancements of existing remediation systems. The Wynnewood refinery has completed the groundwater investigation and ODEQ has approved our corrective action recommendations.
12

The anticipated investigation and remediation costs through 2021 were estimated, as of December 31, 2017, to be as follows:

Facility | SiteInvestigationCosts | | CapitalCosts | | Total Operation &MaintenanceCostsThrough 2021 | | TotalEstimatedCostsThrough 2021
 | (in millions) 
Coffeyville Refinery | $ | 0.1 | | | $ | — | | $ | — | $ | 0.1
Phillipsburg Terminal | 0.3 | | | — | | | — | | 0.3
Wynnewood Refinery | — | | | 2.7 | | | 0.9 | | 3.6
Total Estimated Costs | $ | 0.4 | | | $ | 2.7 | | $ | 0.9 | $ | 4.0

These estimates are based on current information and could increase or decrease as additional information becomes available through our ongoing remediation and investigation activities. At this point, we have estimated that, over ten years starting in 2018, we will spend approximately $7.2 million to remedy impacts from past manufacturing activity at the Coffeyville refinery and to address existing soil and groundwater contamination at the now-closed Phillipsburg terminal and at the Wynnewood refinery. It is possible that additional costs will be required after this ten year period. We spent approximately $2.0 million in 2017 associated with related remediation.
Financial Assurance
We are required under the 2004 Consent Decree to establish financial assurance to secure the projected clean-up costs posed by the Coffeyville and the now-closed Phillipsburg facilities in the event we fail to fulfill our clean-up obligations. In accordance with the 2004 Consent Decree as modified by a 2010 agreement between CRRM, CRT, the EPA and the KDHE, this financial assurance is currently provided by a bond in the amount of $3.0 million for clean-up obligations at the Phillipsburg terminal and a letter of credit in the amount of $0.3 million for estimated costs to close regulated hazardous waste management units at the Coffeyville refinery. Additional self-funded financial assurance of approximately $5.6 million and $2.5 million is required by our post-closure care obligations and the 2004 Consent Decree for clean-up costs at the Coffeyville refinery and Phillipsburg terminal, respectively. The $3.0 million bond amount is reduced each year based on actual expenditures for corrective actions and the letter of credit and the self-funded mechanisms are re-evaluated and adjusted on an annual basis. Current RCRA financial assurance requirements for the Wynnewood refinery total $0.2 million for hazardous waste storage tank closure and post-closure monitoring of a closed storm water retention pond.
Environmental Remediation
As is the case with all companies engaged in similar industries, we face potential exposure from future claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters, including soil and water contamination, personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by crude oil or hazardous substances that we manufactured, handled, used, stored, transported, spilled, disposed of or released. There is no assurance that we will not become involved in future proceedings related to our release of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances or crude oil or that, if we were held responsible for damages in any existing or future proceedings, such costs would be covered by insurance or would not be material. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 12 ("Commitments and Contingencies"), "Flood, Crude Oil Discharge and Insurance" of this Report for discussion of the environmental remediation associated with the discharge of crude oil on July 1, 2007 at the Coffeyville refinery. 
Environmental Insurance
We are covered by CVR Energy's site pollution legal liability insurance policy. The policy includes business interruption coverage. The policy insures any location owned, leased, rented or operated by CVR Refining, including the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries. The policy insures certain pollution conditions at or migrating from a covered location, certain waste transportation and disposal activities and business interruption.
In addition to the site pollution legal liability insurance policy, we benefit from umbrella and excess casualty insurance policies which include sudden and accidental pollution coverage maintained by CVR Energy. This insurance provides coverage due to named perils for claims involving pollutants where the discharge is sudden and accidental and first commences at a specific day and time during the policy period. 
13

The site pollution legal liability policy and the pollution coverage provided in the casualty insurance policies are subject to retentions and deductibles and contain discovery requirements, reporting requirements, exclusions, definitions, conditions and limitations that could apply to a particular pollution claim, and there can be no assurance such claim will be adequately insured for all potential damages.
Safety, Health and Security Matters
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. We also are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. 
We operate a comprehensive safety, health and security program, with participation by employees at all levels of the organization. We have developed comprehensive safety programs aimed at preventing OSHA recordable incidents. Despite our efforts to achieve excellence in our safety and health performance, there can be no assurances that there will not be accidents resulting in injuries or even fatalities. We routinely audit our programs and consider improvements in our management systems.
Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 12 ("Commitments and Contingencies"), "Wynnewood Refinery Incident" of this Report for further discussion of OSHA matters related to the Wynnewood refinery boiler explosion.
