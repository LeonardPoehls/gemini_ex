PSE's revenues and associated expenses are not generated evenly throughout the year, primarily due to seasonal weather patterns, varying wholesale prices for electricity and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to PSE, which make quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult. Weather conditions in PSE's service territory have an impact on customer energy usage, affecting PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses. While both PSE's electric and natural gas sales are generally greatest during winter months, variations in energy usage by customers occur from season to season and also month to month within a season, primarily as result of weather conditions. PSE normally experiences its highest retail energy sales, and subsequently often higher power costs, during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales and subsequently lower power costs in the third quarter of the year. While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms for electric and natural gas operations are expected to normalize the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income. Under the decoupling mechanism, the Washington Commission allows PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers. 
Capital Expenditures

Regulation and Rates
PSE is subject to the regulatory authority of: (i) the FERC with respect to the transmission of electricity, the sale of electricity at wholesale, accounting and certain other matters; and (ii) the Washington Commission as to retail rates, accounting, the issuance of securities and certain other matters.  PSE also must comply with mandatory electric system reliability standards developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the electric reliability organization certified by the FERC, whose standards are enforced by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) in PSE’s operating territory.
2013 Expedited Rate Filing, Decoupling and Centralia Decision 
PSE filed a settlement agreement with the Washington Commission on March 22, 2013. The agreement was intended to settle all issues regarding decoupling, a power purchase agreement with TransAlta Centralia and the Expedited Rate Filing (ERF) which includes the property tax tracker. The Washington Commission placed the ERF and decoupling filings under a common procedural schedule. 
On June 25, 2013, the Washington Commission issued final orders resolving the amended decoupling petition, the ERF filing and the Petition for Reconsideration (related to the TransAlta Centralia power purchase agreement). Order No. 7 in the ERF/decoupling proceeding approved PSE's ERF filing with a small change to its cost of capital from 7.80% to 7.77% to update long- term debt costs and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity (ROE) of 9.8%. This order also approved the property tax tracker discussed below and approved the amended decoupling and rate plan filing with the further condition that PSE and the customers will share 50.0% each in earnings in excess of the 7.77% authorized rate of return. In addition, the rate plan (K-Factor) increase allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs to subsequently increase by 3.0% for the electric customers and 2.2% for the natural gas customers on January 1 of each year, until the conclusion of PSE's next General Rate Case (GRC), which was to be filed before April 1, 2016 and was later extended to January 17, 2017, as discussed below. In the rate plan, increases are subject to a cap of 3.0% of the total revenue for customers. 
Rate mechanisms include: (i) trackers that typically track specific costs during the previous 12-month period and (ii) riders that project cost recovery during a forward looking 12-month period. Both allow recovery of expenditures without the lengthy process of a full GRC. 
The following table shows PSE’s rate filings and whether or not they are included in decoupling rates:

Rate Filings | Electric | Natural Gas
Baseline rates | Yes | Yes 
Annual rate plan increase | Yes | Yes

General Rate Case Filing 
On March 17, 2016, the Washington Commission approved a joint petition postponing the filing of PSE’s GRC until no later than January 17, 2017. As part of the petition, PSE agreed to update power costs on December 1, 2016 in conjunction with the Centralia PPA compliance filing. Additionally, PSE agreed to include in its GRC filing a plan for closure of coal fired steam electric generation facility in Colstrip, Montana (Colstrip) Units 1 and 2, of which PSE owns a 50% interest. Monthly allowed revenue per customer includes an automatic annual increase and will continue through December 2017 when new rates go into effect from PSE's 2017 GRC. 
10

On January 13, 2017, PSE filed its GRC with the Washington Commission which proposed a weighted cost of capital of 7.74%, or 6.69% after-tax, and a capital structure of 48.5% in common equity with a return on equity of 9.8%. The requested combined electric tariff changes would result in a net increase of $86.3 million, or 4.1%. The requested combined natural gas tariff changes would result in a net decrease of $22.3 million, or 2.4%. The filing was subsequently suspended, which means that the final rates granted in the proceeding will go into effect no later than December 13, 2017.
PSE’s GRC filing included the required plan for Colstrip Units 1 and 2 closures, see Item 3, "Legal Proceedings". Additionally, PSE’s filing contains requests for two new mechanisms to address regulatory lag. PSE has requested procedures for an ERF that can be used to update PSE’s delivery revenues on an expedited basis following a general rate case proceeding. PSE also requested approval to establish an electric CRM similar to its existing natural gas CRM which would allow PSE to obtain accelerated cost recovery on specified electric reliability projects.
Decoupling Filings
The Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers. This monthly adjustment mitigates the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer. As a result, these electric and natural gas revenues will be recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual consumption levels. The energy supply costs, which are part of the power cost adjustment (PCA) and purchased gas adjustment (PGA) mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling mechanism. The revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption. Following each calendar year, PSE will recover from, or refund to, customers the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and the corresponding actual revenue during the following May to April time period. The allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs will subsequently increase by 3.0% for the electric customers and 2.2% for the natural gas customers on January 1 of each year. The decoupling mechanism will end on December 31, 2017 unless the continuation of the requested mechanism is approved in PSE’s 2017 GRC which PSE filed on January 13, 2017. Decoupling over and under collections will still be collectible or refundable after December 31, 2017, even if the decoupling mechanism is not extended.
Electric Rate Filings
Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism
PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the “power cost baseline” level of power costs. The “power cost baseline” is set in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions.  Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached. 
The graduated scale that was applicable through December 31, 2016 was as follows:

Annual Power Cost Variability | Company’s Share | Customers' Share
+/- $20 million | 100% | —% 
+/- $20 million - $40 million | 50 | 50 
+/- $40 million - $120 million | 10 | 90 
+/- $120 + million | 5 | 95 

On August 7, 2015, the Washington Commission issued an order approving the settlement proposing changes to the PCA mechanism. The settlement agreement took effect January 1, 2017 and will apply the following graduated scale:

Annual Power Cost Variability | Company's Share | Customers’ Share
Over or Under Collection: | Over | Under | Over | Under
Over or Under Collected by up to $17 million | 100% | 100% | —% | —% 
Over or Under Collected by between $17 million - $40 million | 35 | 50 | 65 | 50 
Over or Under Collected beyond $40 + million | 10 | 10 | 90 | 90 

11

The settlement also resulted in the following changes to the PCA mechanism:

• | Reduction to the cumulative deferral trigger for surcharge or refund from $30.0 million to $20.0 million;


• | Removal of fixed production costs from the PCA mechanism and placing them in the decoupling mechanism, assuming the decoupling mechanism continues after its review in the 2017 GRC. If decoupling was not to continue, those fixed production costs would be treated the same as other non-PCA costs unless permission to treat them in another manner is obtained from the Washington Commission. These fixed production costs include: (i) return and depreciation/amortization on fixed production assets and regulatory assets and liabilities; (ii) return on, depreciation, transmission expense and revenues on specific transmission assets; and (iii) hydro, other production and other power related expenses and O&M costs; 


• | Suspension of the requirement that a GRC must be filed within three months after rates are approved in a Power Cost Only Rate Case (PCORC);


• | Agreement, for a five-year period, that PSE will not file a GRC or PCORC within six months of the date rates go into effect for a PCORC filing; and


• | Establishment of a five-year moratorium on changes to the PCA.

PSE had an annual PCA receivable during the year ended December 31, 2016, due to under recovering $1.0 million of power costs.  This compares to an annual PCA receivable of $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The change was driven by a decrease in actual costs. 
Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff
The Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff passes through to customers the benefits associated with realized treasury grants and PTCs. The filing results in a credit back to customers for pass-back of treasury grant amortization and pass-through of interest and any related true-ups. The filing is adjusted annually for new Federal benefits, actual versus forecast interest and to true-up for actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates.
Power Cost Only Rate Case 
A limited-scope proceeding was approved in 2002 by the Washington Commission to periodically reset power cost rates.  In addition to providing the opportunity to reset all power costs, the PCORC proceeding also provides for timely review of new resource acquisition costs and inclusion of such costs in rates at the time the new resource goes into service.  To achieve this objective, the Washington Commission has used an expedited six-month PCORC decision timeline rather than the statutory 11-month timeline for a GRC.
Electric Property Tax Tracker Mechanism
The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company. The mechanism was implemented in 2013 and removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs for recovery in an adjusting tariff rate. After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed. The tracker will be adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes and true-ups to the rate from the prior year.
Electric Conservation Rider
The electric conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation. Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January and to true-up for actual compared to forecast conservation expenditures from the prior year as well as actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates. 
Natural Gas Rate Filings
Purchased Gas Adjustment
PSE has a PGA mechanism that allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected natural gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest. PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances. A receivable or payable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an under recovery or over recovery, respectively, of natural gas cost through the PGA mechanism.
12

Cost Recovery Mechanism 
The purpose of the CRM is to recover capital costs related to projects included in PSE's pipe replacement program plan on file with the Washington Commission with the intended effect of enhancing the safety of the natural gas distribution system.
Natural Gas Property Tax Tracker Mechanism 
The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company. The mechanism was implemented in 2013 and removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs for recovery in an adjusting tariff rate. After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed. The tracker will be adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes.
Natural Gas Conservation Rider
The natural gas conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation. Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January and to true-up for actual versus forecast conservation expenditures from the prior year as well as actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates.

Electric Supply
At December 31, 2016, PSE’s electric power resources, which include company-owned or controlled resources as well as those under long-term contract, had a total capacity of approximately 4,844 megawatts (MW).  PSE’s historical peak load of approximately 4,912 MW occurred on December 10, 2009.  In order to meet an extreme winter peak load, PSE may supplement its electric power resources with winter-peaking call options and other instruments. When it is more economical for PSE to purchase power than to operate its own generation facilities, PSE will purchase spot market energy when sufficient transmission capacity is available.
The following table shows PSE’s electric energy supply resources and energy production for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

Columbia River Electric Energy Supply Contracts
During 2016, approximately 13.7% of PSE’s energy supply requirement was obtained through long-term contracts with three Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own and operate hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River (Mid-Columbia).  PSE agrees to pay a share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project in proportion to its share of projected output.  PSE’s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable.
As of December 31, 2016, PSE was entitled to purchase portions of the power output of the PUDs’ projects as set forth below:

 | | | Company’s AnnualPurchasable Amount(Approximate)
Project | ContractExpiration Year | LicenseExpiration Year | Percent ofOutput | MW Capacity
Chelan County PUD: | | | | 
Rock Island Project | 2031 | 2029 | 25.0 | % | 156

Wanapum Development | 2052 | 2052 | 0.6 | % | 9 
Total | | | | | 749

Other Electric Supply, Exchange and Transmission Contracts and Agreements
PSE purchases electric energy under long-term firm purchased power contracts with other utilities and marketers in the Western region.  PSE is generally not obligated to make payments under these contracts unless power is delivered.  PSE has seasonal energy and capacity exchange agreements with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) for 44 aMW of capacity which expires on July 1, 2017 with no provision to renew this agreement. PSE will procure more capacity from Mid-Columbia to recover for this loss of capacity, if needed. PSE also has an agreement with Pacific Gas & Electric Company for 300 MW of capacity which currently has no set expiration.
PSE began participating in the Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) operated by the California Independent System Operator on October 1, 2016. Participation is expected to reduce costs for PSE customers, enhance system reliability, integrate variable energy resources, and leverage geographic diversity of electricity demand and generation resources.
PSE has entered into multiple various-term transmission contracts with other utilities to integrate electric generation and contracted resources into PSE’s system.  These transmission contracts require PSE to pay for transmission service based on the contracted MW level of demand, regardless of actual use. Other transmission agreements provide actual capacity ownership or capacity ownership rights.  PSE’s annual charges under these agreements are also based on contracted MW volumes.  Capacity on these agreements that is not committed to serve PSE’s load is available for sale to third parties.  PSE also purchases short-term transmission services from a variety of providers, including the BPA.
In 2016, PSE had 4,646 MW and 695 MW of total transmission demand contracted with the BPA and other utilities, respectively.  PSE’s remaining transmission capacity needs are met via PSE owned transmission assets.
Natural Gas Supply for Electric Customers
PSE purchases natural gas supplies for its power portfolio to meet demand for its combustion turbine generators. Supplies range from long-term to daily agreements, as the demand for the turbines varies depending on market heat rates.  Purchases are made from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.  PSE also enters into financial hedges to manage the cost of natural gas.  PSE utilizes natural gas storage capacity and transportation that is dedicated to and paid for by the power portfolio to facilitate increased natural gas supply reliability and intra-day dispatch of PSE’s natural gas-fired generation resources.  During 2016, approximately 64.0% of natural gas purchased for the power portfolio originated in British Columbia, 20.0% in Alberta and 16.0% in the United States.  
18

Integrated Resource Plans, Resource Acquisition and Development
PSE is required by Washington Commission regulations to file an electric and natural gas integrated resource plan (IRP) every two years.  The 2015 IRP was filed on November 30, 2015 and identified the following capacity needs:

 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021
Projected MW shortfall/(surplus) | (28) | (43) | (44) | (71) | 275 

The expected capacity needs reflect the mix of energy efficiency programs deemed cost effective in the 2015 IRP. In 2015, PSE renewed all the Mid-Columbia transmission available for renewal during the year to meet peak capacity needs. 
PSE projects that beginning in 2021 its future energy needs will exceed current resources in its supply portfolio.  The IRP identifies declining regional surpluses, requiring replacement of supplies to meet projected demands.  Therefore, PSE’s IRP sets forth a multi-part strategy of implementing energy efficiency programs and pursuing additional renewable resources (primarily wind) and additional base load natural gas-fired generation to meet the growing needs of its customers.  If PSE cannot acquire needed energy supply resources at a reasonable cost, it may be required to purchase additional power in the wholesale market, subject to the sharing bands of the PCA mechanism, at a cost that could, in the absence of regulatory relief, increase its expenses and reduce earnings and cash flows. The IRP will be updated in 2017 and is expected to be filed July 15, 2017.

Natural Gas Supply for Natural Gas Customers
PSE purchases a portfolio of natural gas supplies ranging from long-term firm to daily from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada (British Columbia and Alberta).  PSE also enters into physical and financial hedges to manage volatility in the cost of natural gas.  All of PSE’s natural gas supply is ultimately transported through the facilities of Northwest Pipeline GP (NWP), the sole interstate pipeline delivering directly into PSE’s service territory.  Accordingly, delivery of natural gas supply to PSE’s natural gas system is dependent upon the reliable operations of NWP.

For base load, peak management and supply reliability purposes, PSE supplements its firm natural gas supply portfolio by purchasing natural gas in periods of lower demand, injecting it into underground storage facilities and withdrawing it during the peak winter heating season.  Underground storage facilities at Jackson Prairie in western Washington and at Clay Basin in Utah are used for this purpose.  Clay Basin withdrawals are used to supplement purchases from the U.S. Rocky Mountain supply region, while Jackson Prairie provides incremental peak-day resources utilizing firm storage redelivery transportation capacity.  Jackson Prairie is also used for daily balancing of load requirements on PSE’s natural gas system.  Peaking needs are also met by using PSE-owned natural gas held in PSE’s LNG peaking facility located within its distribution system in Gig Harbor, Washington; as well as interrupting service to customers on interruptible service rates, if necessary.
PSE expects to meet its firm peak-day requirements for residential, commercial and industrial markets through its firm natural gas purchase contracts, firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity and other firm peaking resources.  PSE believes it will be able to acquire incremental firm natural gas supply and capacity to meet anticipated growth in the requirements of its firm customers for the foreseeable future.
During 2016, approximately 56.0% of natural gas purchased by PSE for its natural gas customers originated in British Columbia, 21.0% originated in Alberta and 23.0% in the United States.  PSE’s firm natural gas supply portfolio has adequate flexibility in its transportation arrangements to enable it to achieve savings when there are regional price differentials between natural gas supply basins.  The geographic mix of suppliers and daily, monthly and annual take requirements permit some degree of flexibility in managing natural gas supplies during periods of lower demand to minimize costs.  Natural gas is marketed outside of PSE’s service territory (off-system sales) to optimize resources when on-system customer demand requirements permit and market economics are favorable; the resulting economics of these transactions are reflected in PSE’s natural gas customer tariff rates through the PGA mechanism.
21

Natural Gas Storage Capacity
PSE holds storage capacity in the Jackson Prairie and Clay Basin underground natural gas storage facilities adjacent to NWP’s pipeline to serve PSE’s natural gas customers.  The Jackson Prairie facility is operated and one-third owned by PSE and is used primarily for intermediate peaking purposes due to its ability to deliver a large volume of natural gas in a short time period.  Combined with capacity contracted from NWP’s one-third stake in Jackson Prairie, PSE holds firm withdrawal capacity in excess of 453,800 Dekatherm (Dth) per day, and over 9.8 million Dth of storage capacity at the Jackson Prairie facility. Of this total, PSE holds 397,100 Dth per day of the firm withdrawal capacity and over 9.2 million Dth of storage capacity designated to serve natural gas customers, which represents nearly 42% of PSE's expected near-term peak-day requirement. The location of the Jackson Prairie facility in PSE’s market area increases supply reliability and provides significant pipeline demand cost savings by reducing the amount of annual pipeline capacity required to meet peak-day natural gas requirements.   
Of the remaining Jackson Prairie storage capacity, 56,700 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 641,000 Dth of storage capacity is currently designated to PSE's power portfolio, increasing natural gas supply reliability and facilitating intra-day dispatch of PSE's natural gas-fired generation resources. In addition, PSE has temporarily released approximately 6,100 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 178,500 of Dth of storage capacity to a third party, in exchange for temporary firm pipeline capacity on a constrained portion of NWP's system.
The Clay Basin storage facility is a supply area storage facility that provides operational flexibility and price protection.  PSE holds over 12.9 million Dth of Clay Basin storage capacity and approximately 107,000 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity under two long-term contracts with remaining terms of one and three years and has rights to extend such agreements.  PSE has temporarily released a portion of its Clay Basin storage services to third parties, and its net storage capacity and maximum firm withdrawal capacity at Clay Basin is 8.9 million Dth and over 74,000 Dth per day, respectively.
LNG and Propane-Air Resources
LNG and propane-air resources provide firm natural gas supply on short notice for short periods of time.  Due to their typically high cost and slow cycle times, these resources are normally utilized as a last resort supply source in extreme peak-demand periods, typically during the coldest hours or days.
During 2014, PSE, working with NWP determined that the pipeline redelivery service to PSE from NWP’s Plymouth LNG facility could no longer be considered firm during peak conditions. As a result, PSE terminated the service agreement effective October 31, 2015 and removed the resource from its natural gas firm portfolio. In 2015, PSE and NWP negotiated a new contract for Plymouth LNG service for PSE’s generation fleet, which provides for LNG storage services of 241,700 Dth of PSE-owned natural gas at Plymouth, with a maximum daily deliverability of 70,500 Dth.  PSE will use the Plymouth contract as an alternate supply source for natural gas required to serve PSE’s generation fleet during peak periods on a daily or intra-day basis. In addition, PSE acquired 15,000 Dth/day of firm pipeline capacity for the generation fleet. The balance of the LNG capacity will be delivered using firm NWP pipeline transportation service previously acquired to serve PSE’s generation fleet.
PSE owns and operates the Swarr vaporized propane-air station located in Renton, Washington which includes storage capacity for approximately 1.5 million gallons of propane.  This vaporized propane-air injection facility delivers the thermal equivalent of 10,000 Dth of natural gas per day for up to 12 days directly into PSE’s distribution system, however, it is temporarily not in-service pending planned environmental, safety, efficiency and reliability upgrades.  PSE owns and operates an LNG peaking facility in Gig Harbor, Washington, with total capacity of 10,600 Dth, which is capable of delivering the equivalent of 2,500 Dth of natural gas per day. 
Puget LNG LLC
In August 2015, PSE filed a proposal with the Washington Commission to develop a LNG facility at the Port of Tacoma. The Tacoma LNG facility will provide peak-shaving services to PSE’s natural gas customers, and will provide LNG as fuel to transportation customers, particularly in the marine market. Following a mediation process and the filing of a settlement stipulation by PSE and all parties, the Washington Commission issued an order on October 31, 2016 that allowed PSE’s parent company, Puget Energy, to create a wholly-owned subsidiary, named Puget LNG LLC (Puget LNG).  Puget LNG, which was formed on November 29, 2016, will have the sole purpose of owning, developing and financing the non-regulated activity of the Tacoma LNG facility. Puget LNG has entered into one fuel supply agreement with a maritime customer, and is marketing the facility’s expected output to other potential customers. 
Currently under construction at the Port of Tacoma, the Tacoma LNG facility is expected to be operational in 2019. Pursuant to the Commission’s order, Puget LNG will be allocated 57% of the capital and operating costs of the Tacoma LNG facility and PSE will be allocated the remaining 43% of the capital and operating costs. The portion of the Tacoma LNG facility allocated to PSE will be subject to regulation by the Washington Commission. 
22

Natural Gas Transportation Capacity
PSE currently holds firm transportation capacity on pipelines owned by NWP, Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN), Nova Gas Transmission (NOVA), Foothills Pipe Lines (Foothills) and Spectra's Westcoast Energy (Westcoast).  GTN, NOVA, and Foothills are all TransCanada companies.  PSE pays fixed monthly demand charges for the right, but not the obligation, to transport specified quantities of natural gas from receipt points to delivery points on such pipelines each day for the term or terms of the applicable agreements.
PSE holds approximately 543,000 Dth per day of capacity for its natural gas customers on NWP that provides firm year-round delivery to PSE’s service territory.  In addition, PSE holds approximately 447,000 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored at Jackson Prairie.  PSE holds approximately 218,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity on NWP to supply natural gas to its electric generating facilities.  In addition PSE holds over 34,000 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored in Jackson Prairie for its electric generating facilities. PSE’s firm transportation capacity contracts with NWP have remaining terms ranging from two to 28 years.  However, PSE has either the unilateral right to extend the contracts under the contracts’ current terms or the right of first refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules.
PSE’s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on Westcoast’s pipeline is 132,000 Dth per day under various contracts, with remaining terms of two to four years.  PSE has other firm transportation capacity on Westcoast’s pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling 86,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of two to four years and an option for PSE to renew its rights under the Westcoast contract.  PSE has firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, each totaling approximately 80,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of two to seven years and an option for PSE to renew its rights on the capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines.  PSE has other firm transportation capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, which supplies the electric generating facilities, each totaling approximately 41,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of four to seven years. PSE’s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on the GTN pipeline, totaling over 77,000 Dth per day, has a remaining term of seven years and PSE has a first right-of-refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules. PSE has other firm transportation capacity on GTN pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling 41,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of four to seven years.
Capacity Release
The FERC regulates the release of firm pipeline and storage capacity for facilities which fall under its jurisdiction.  Capacity releases allow shippers to temporarily or permanently relinquish unutilized capacity to recover all or a portion of the cost of such capacity.  The FERC allows capacity to be released through several methods including open bidding and pre-arrangement.  PSE has acquired some firm pipeline and storage service through capacity release provisions to serve its growing service territory and electric generation portfolio.  PSE also mitigates a portion of the demand charges related to unutilized storage and pipeline capacity through capacity release.  Capacity release benefits derived from the natural gas customer portfolio are passed on to PSE’s natural gas customers through the PGA mechanism.
Energy Efficiency
PSE is required under Washington state law to pursue all available conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible. PSE offers programs designed to help new and existing residential, commercial and industrial customers use energy efficiently.  PSE uses a variety of mechanisms including cost-effective financial incentives, information and technical services to enable customers to make energy efficient choices with respect to building design, equipment and building systems, appliance purchases and operating practices.  PSE recovers the actual costs of its electric and natural gas energy efficiency programs through rider mechanisms.  However, the rider mechanisms do not provide assistance with gross margin erosion associated with reduced energy sales.  To address this issue, PSE received approval in 2013 from the Washington Commission for electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms, which mitigates gross margin erosion resulting from the Company's energy efficiency efforts.
Environment
PSE’s operations, including generation, transmission, distribution, service and storage facilities, are subject to environmental laws and regulations by federal, state and local authorities.  See below for the primary areas of environmental law that have the potential to most significantly impact PSE’s operations and costs.
Air and Climate Change Protection
PSE owns numerous thermal generation facilities, including natural gas plants and an ownership percentage of Colstrip.  All of these facilities are governed by the Clean Air Act (CAA), and all have CAA Title V operating permits, which must be renewed every five years.  This renewal process could result in additional costs to the plants. PSE continues to monitor the permit renewal process to determine the corresponding potential impact to the plants. These facilities also emit greenhouse gases (GHG), and 
23

thus are also subject to any current or future GHG or climate change legislation or regulation.  The Colstrip plant represents PSE’s most significant source of GHG emissions.
Species Protection
PSE owns hydroelectric plants, wind farms and numerous miles of above ground electric distribution and transmission lines which can be impacted by laws related to species protection.  A number of species of fish have been listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which influences hydroelectric operations, and may affect PSE operations, potentially representing cost exposure and operational constraints.  Similarly, there are a number of avian and terrestrial species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.  Designations of protected species under these two laws have the potential to influence operation of our wind farms and above ground transmission and distribution systems.
Remediation 
PSE and its predecessors are responsible for environmental remediation at various sites.  These include properties currently and formerly owned by PSE (or its predecessors), as well as third-party owned properties where hazardous substances were allegedly generated, transported or released.  The primary cleanup laws to which PSE is subject include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (federal) and, in Washington, the Model Toxics Control Act (state).  PSE is also subject to applicable remediation laws in the state of Montana for its ownership interest in Colstrip. These laws may hold liable any current or past owner or operator of a contaminated site, as well as any generator, transporter, arranger, or disposer of regulated substances.
Hazardous and Solid Waste and PCB Handling and Disposal
Related to certain operations, including power generation and transmission and distribution maintenance, PSE must handle and dispose of certain hazardous and solid wastes.  These actions are regulated by the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (federal), the Toxic Substances Control Act (federal) and hazardous or dangerous waste regulations (state) that impose complex requirements on handling and disposing of regulated substances.
Water Protection
PSE facilities that discharge wastewater or storm water or store bulk petroleum products are governed by the Clean Water Act (federal and state) which includes the Oil Pollution Act amendments.  This includes most generation facilities (and all of those with water discharges and some with bulk fuel storage), and many other facilities and construction projects depending on drainage, facility or construction activities, and chemical, petroleum and material storage.
Siting New Facilities
In siting new generation, transmission, distribution or other related facilities in Washington, PSE is subject to the State Environmental Policy Act, and may be subject to the federal National Environmental Policy Act, if there is a federal nexus, in addition to other possible local siting and zoning ordinances.  These requirements may potentially require mitigation of environmental impacts as well as other measures that can add significant cost to new facilities.
Recent and Future Environmental Law and Regulation
Recent and future environmental laws and regulations may be imposed at a federal, state or local level and may have a significant impact on the cost of PSE operations.  PSE monitors legislative and regulatory developments for environmental issues with the potential to alter the operation and cost of our generation plants, transmission and distribution system, and other assets.  Described below are the recent, pending and potential future environmental law and regulations with the most significant potential impacts to PSE’s operations and costs.
Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions
PSE recognizes the growing concern that increased atmospheric concentrations of GHG contribute to climate change.  PSE believes that climate change is an important issue that requires careful analysis and considered responses.  As climate policy continues to evolve at the state and federal levels, PSE remains involved in state, regional and federal policymaking activities. PSE will continue to monitor the development of any climate change or climate change related air emission reduction initiative at the state and western regional level.  PSE will also consider the known impact of any future legislation or new government regulation on the cost of generation in its IRP process.

PSE's Greenhouse Gas Emission Reporting
PSE is required to submit, on an annual basis, a report of its GHG emissions to the state of Washington including a report of emissions from all individual power plants emitting over 10,000 tons per year of GHGs and from certain natural gas distribution operations.  Emissions exceeding 25,000 tons per year of GHGs from these sources must also be reported to the environmental protection agency (EPA). Capital investments to monitor GHGs from the power plants and in the distribution system are not required at this time.  Since 2002, PSE has voluntarily undertaken an annual inventory of its GHG emissions associated with PSE’s total electric retail load served from a supply portfolio of owned and purchased resources.  
The most recent data indicate that PSE’s total GHG emissions (direct and indirect) from its electric supply portfolio in 2015 were 11.9 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.  Approximately 41.49% of PSE’s total GHG emissions (approximately 5.0 million tons) are associated with PSE’s ownership and contractual interests in Colstrip. While Colstrip remains a significant portion of PSE’s GHG emissions, Colstrip is an important part of the existing diversified portfolio PSE owns and/or operates for its customers.  Consequently, PSE’s overall emissions strategy demonstrates a concerted effort to manage customers’ needs with an appropriate balance of new renewable generation, existing generation owned and/or operated by PSE and significant energy efficiency efforts.
Federal Greenhouse Gas Rules
On August 3, 2015, the EPA announced a final rule regarding New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) for the control of carbon dioxide (CO2) from new power plants that burn fossil fuels under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act. The rule was published on October 23, 2015, and separates standards for new power plants fueled by natural gas and coal. New natural gas power plants can emit no more than 1,000 lbs. of CO2/megawatt hour (MWh) which is achievable with the latest combined cycle technology. New coal power plants can emit no more than 1,400 lbs. of CO2/MWh, which is less stringent than the draft rule. The standard for coal plants would not specifically require Carbon Dioxide Capture and Sequestration (CCS) but CCS was reaffirmed by the EPA as the “best system of emission reductions” (BSER). These 111(b) standards are implemented by the states, but states have limited flexibility to alter the standards set by the EPA. 
 The EPA announced the final rule for 111(d), the Clean Power Plan rule, on August 3, 2015 and published it on October 23, 2015. The rule included several changes from the draft rule. Specifically, the EPA excluded energy efficiency from one of four "building blocks" identified in the draft rule, leaving just three building blocks (i) increased efficiency for coal plants, (ii) greater utilization of natural gas plants and (iii) increased renewable sources. In the final rule, the EPA provided more flexibility in achieving interim goals by phasing in the reduction and giving states the option to set their own interim compliance glide path and pushing the start of compliance to 2022. The EPA also adjusted the 2012 baseline to address hydroelectricity variability and provided specific CO2 mass targets by year for each state. 
States have broad flexibility to pick a rate-based or mass-based approach and can design compliance options and decide how to allocate credits and whether to allow trading. The EPA also gave states the option of seeking additional time, if necessary, to formulate a state plan. States must submit something within one year but can request up to an additional two years for development of a state plan. Thus, states must submit a plan for implementing CO2 reductions to the EPA one to three years following issuance of the final rule. 
Washington Clean Air Rule
The Clean Air Rule (CAR) was adopted on September 15, 2016 in Washington State and attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from “covered entities” located within Washington State. Included under the new rule are large manufacturers, petroleum producers and natural gas utilities, including PSE. CAR sets a cap on emissions associated with covered entities, which decreases over time approximately 5% every three years. Entities must reduce their carbon emissions, or purchase emission reduction units (ERUs), as defined under the rule, from others. 
CAR covers natural gas distributors and subjects them to an emissions reduction pathway based on the indirect emissions of their customers. CAR regulates the emissions of natural gas utilities' 1.2 million customers across the state, adding to the cost of natural gas for homes and businesses, which may increase costs to PSE customers. 
On September 27, 2016, PSE, along with Avista Corporation, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation and NW Natural, filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington challenging CAR. On September 30, 2016, the four companies filed a similar challenge to CAR in Thurston County Superior Court. While awaiting the outcome of the pending litigation, the Company has undertaken steps to comply with the first compliance period of CAR, which began January 1, 2017.

Mercury Emissions
Mercury control equipment has been installed at Colstrip and has operated at a level that meets the current Montana requirement.  Compliance, based on a rolling 12-month average, was first confirmed in January 2011, and PSE continues to meet the requirement.
The EPA published the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) in February 2012. Generating units were given three years, until April 2015, to comply with MATS and could receive up to a 1-year extension from state permitting authorities if necessary for the installation of controls. Colstrip met the MATS limits for mercury and acid gases as of April 2016. 
Regional Haze Rule
On June 15, 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility rule to address regional haze or regionally-impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area.  The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units, including presumptive limits for sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxide controls for large units.  The final Federal Implementation Plan for Montana (FIP) for Regional Haze was issued in September 2012. There are no immediate requirements for Units 3 and 4, but Units 1 and 2 will need to upgrade pollution controls to meet new sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide limits. The Sierra Club filed an appeal of the FIP with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit) on November 15, 2012 and PPL Montana also filed an appeal as the Colstrip operator. 
The case was heard on May 15, 2014 in Seattle, Washington, and the final decision by the Ninth Circuit was issued June 9, 2015. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed the EPA’s first phase requirements for Colstrip and found that the EPA had not adequately justified the need for two of the control technologies and remanded these two issues back to the EPA. The EPA informally indicated that it will wait until the next Regional Haze planning period to reissue a FIP.
The ruling in no way affects the future planning periods for the Regional Haze program or the glide path for the Company. The current EPA assessment is that the state of Montana will require significant emission reductions to meet the natural visibility goal by 2064 which means additional emission reductions will be necessary in future 10-year planning periods, beginning in the 2018-2028 periods, and there is risk and uncertainty regarding potential costs.
In July 2016, the EPA proposed to delay new Regional Haze review from 2018 to 2021 and that proposal is currently awaiting approval, however the end date will remain 2028. In the meantime, Montana has indicated that they plan to work on and submit a State Implementation Plan for the second planning period.
Coal Combustion Residuals
On April 17, 2015, the EPA published a final rule, effective October 19, 2015, that regulates Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Subtitle D. The CCR rule addresses the risks from coal ash disposal, such as leaking of contaminants into ground water, blowing of contaminants into the air as dust, and the catastrophic failure of coal ash containment structures by establishing technical design, operation and maintenance, closure and post closure care requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments, and corrective action requirements for any related leakage. The rule also sets forth recordkeeping and reporting requirements including posting specific information related to CCR surface impoundments and landfills to publicly-accessible websites. The EPA published another rule, which became effective on October 4, 2016, extending certain compliance deadlines contained in the original CCR rule.
The initial rule was self-implementing to be enforced by citizen lawsuits rather than the EPA. On December 16, 2016, President Obama signed legislation amending RCRA to allow a state to take over the CCR program. Under the amendment, if a state does not seek approval of a permit program or if the EPA denies a state application, the EPA would be required to adopt a permit program in lieu of the current self-implementing rule, as long as Congress grants the funding for the EPA to do so. This would not eliminate the threat of citizen lawsuits but could provide more certainty regarding interpretations and ultimate compliance. If no permit program is in effect in a state, the CCR rule will remain self-implementing.
The CCR rule requires significant changes to the Company's Colstrip operations and those changes were reviewed by the Company and the plant operator in the second quarter of 2015. PSE had previously recognized a legal obligation under the EPA rules to dispose of coal ash material at Colstrip in 2003. Due to the CCR rule, additional disposal costs were added to the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (ARO).

PCB Handling and Disposal
In April 2010, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) soliciting information on a broad range of questions concerning inventory, management, use, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) containing equipment.  The EPA is using this ANPRM to seek data to better evaluate whether to initiate a rulemaking process geared toward a mandatory phase-out of all PCBs.
The rule was scheduled to be published in July 2015 but due to the number of comments received by the EPA, the rule has undergone multiple extensions and revisions. According to the EPA, the notice of proposed rulemaking is projected to be published in November 2017. At this point, PSE cannot determine what impacts this rulemaking will have on its operations, if any, but will continue to work closely with the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group (USWAG) and the American Gas Association (AGA) to monitor developments.
