 Insurance 
 Syntel serves the needs of global property and casualty insurers, insurance brokers, personal, commercial, life and retirement insurance service providers.

We focus on aspects of our clients systems and operations, such as policy administration, claims processing and compliance reporting. We also serve the growing trend among insurers to improve their sales and marketing processes by deepening direct customer relationships and strengthening interactions with networks of independent and captive insurance agents. This is often accomplished through the use of digital front-end technologies like web enablement, social media and mobility, and supported by modernization of applications, product implementations and infrastructure elements, along with cloud enablement. Additionally, many insurers seek to improve business effectiveness by reducing expense ratios. Syntel helps our customers achieve this by managed services and IT and process automation with our industry leading SyntBots® automation platform.

 We provide technology services and business consulting in a range of sub-sectors including industrial products, aerospace and automotive manufacturing, as well as to processors of raw materials and natural resources.

INDUSTRY 
 Digital technologies are becoming ubiquitous in our personal and professional lives. Every industry is facing disruption from Born Digital competitors who are leveraging technology to disrupt existing business models. 
 Global 2000 companies are facing the urgent need to evolve into digital enterprises. They must simultaneously address two challenges  to implement digital technology and business models to compete with disruptive competitors and modernize their technology infrastructure and systems to seamlessly integrate into the digital ecosystem. 
 Syntels message to its clients is Evolve the Core and Go Digital to achieve more. Syntel helps Global 2000 companies manage and modernize their existing IT systems and knowledge processes and delivers digital solutions to transform their business for the Digital Age. 
 

 | Core Services: Optimize the management of Run the Business services, through outsourcing of their information technology (IT) and business / knowledge processes. The primary driver for outsourcing is greater efficiency through standardized processes, reliability and scalability, resulting in lower total cost of ownership.

 | Digital Services: Invest in transformational Change the Business digital programs to drive new customer acquisition, revenue growth, speed to market and business agility.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Demand for core IT services is driven by companies seeking to outsource not just specific projects for the design, development and integration of new technology systems, but also ongoing management, maintenance and enhancement of existing technology systems and infrastructure. Traditional application and infrastructure management services have evolved into integrated IT Operations services (IT Ops) through the use of intelligent automation. Service providers best positioned to benefit from the demand for Core Services have access to a pool of skilled professionals, a proven ability to manage large-scale IT and KPO programs, robust methodologies for managing transition, projects and risk, low-cost offshore software development facilities, and operational scalability to meet customer growth requirements. Providers with strong expertise in automation solutions can create competitive advantage by providing greater efficiency and lower risk. 
 Digital Services include the implementation and management of new technology solutions in Big Data analytics, customer experience, process digitization and connected devices using Internet of Things (IoT). Demand for Digital Services is driven by skills in new and emerging technologies, an understanding of the complexities of a rapidly-changing technology landscape and knowledge of digital business models and their impact on different industries. Companies are increasingly adopting a Product Engineering approach for developing new applications, leveraging cloud based development platforms, Agile development methodology and integrated software development and testing (DevOps). 
 Demand for Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) services is driven by enterprises looking beyond IT outsourcing to drive cost efficiency by outsourcing business and knowledge processes. KPO services can deliver greater efficiency and improved service levels for the client. Companies are increasingly adopting automation technologies to drive greater efficiency levels in business process operations.     
 Global delivery of services is an integral element of the business strategy of any Global 2000 corporation. Services globalization enables companies to access a global pool of skilled talent and capabilities to drive greater competiveness. A well-executed global services model delivers higher quality, lower cost, faster turnaround, and responsive and customized service. 
 Syntels customer-centric approach delivers tangible value to clients through a flexible model that combines technology skills, intellectual property and business domain expertise to develop innovative solutions to solve unique business problems. Our organization is focused on and aligned to help customers strike the right balance between investing in new initiatives and optimizing and modernizing existing ones. Syntels Customer for Life philosophy emphasizes flexibility, customer responsiveness, value focus and a tradition of delivery excellence. 
 During 2017, the Company provided services to 136 customers, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. Syntel has been chosen as a preferred vendor by many of its customers and has been recognized for its quality and responsiveness. The Company seeks to develop long-term relationships with 
 
4 
 
 its customers in order to become a trusted business partner and expand its presence with current customers. Additionally, the Company believes that its domain expertise, breadth of services and strong alignment with client culture and business imperatives are important decision factors in Syntel being chosen as a preferred vendor. The Companys investment in developing the SyntBots intelligent automation platform enables it to deliver higher levels of efficiency and quality to client engagements. 
 The Company has an integrated sales and marketing approach that leverages a dedicated sales team to identify and acquire new accounts and work with engagement teams to expand and cross-sell within existing accounts. The sales and engagement teams efforts are complemented by teams who cover the analyst, advisory and product alliance channels. 
 The Company believes that human resources are its most valuable asset and invests significantly in programs to recruit, train and retain technology and operations professionals. The Company recruits through a global recruiting network and maintains a broad package of employee support programs. Syntel believes that its management structure and human resources organization is designed to maximize the Companys ability to efficiently expand its professional staff in response to customer needs.

 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE 
 Over the past 37 years, Syntel has been able to align its services, client value proposition and its business model to stay ahead of the curve and remain relevant and valuable to its clients. Syntels competitive advantage is underpinned by the following core competencies: 
 Customers for Life: The Company recognizes that its best source for new business opportunities comes from existing customers and believes that superior customer service is a differentiating factor  as evidenced by Syntels high rate of repeat business. At the beginning of a customer engagement, Syntels services are based on technical and domain expertise and experience. Over time, Syntel develops an in-depth knowledge of the customers business processes, applications, processes and industry, enabling Syntel to identify and implement new higher-value services for that customer. 
 Industry Domain: Syntels mission statement is We create new opportunities for our clients by harnessing our talent, passion and innovation. The Company is focused on developing a strong understanding of its clients businesses to drive new opportunities to improve their business performance. Syntel has developed methodologies, toolsets and proprietary knowledge applicable to specific industries. Syntel combines deep industry knowledge with an understanding of its clients needs and technologies to provide high-value, high-quality services that are 
 
5 
 
 strongly linked to their underlying business. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Companys percentage of revenue by industry segment was 45%, 18%, 18%, 15% and 4% for banking and financial services, retail, logistics and telecom, healthcare and life sciences, insurance and manufacturing, respectively. 
 Depth and Breadth of Technology Service Offerings: The Company provides a comprehensive range of technology services, including IT Ops (application and infrastructure management), Product Engineering (application development, and testing), Legacy Modernization (application modernization, data modernization and cloud migration) and Digital (customer experience, process digitization, data and insights and IoT). This broad technology expertise and experience enables the Company to partner closely with its customers to solve a wide variety of business problems through the power of technology. 
 Intellectual Property: Over its 37-year history, Syntel has developed proven methodologies and practices, innovative accelerators, tools and utilities, reusable software assets, and technical expertise for the development, management and transformation of its customers information systems and business processes. The Company believes this intellectual property enhances its ability to understand customer needs, design customized solutions and provide high quality services faster and cost-effectively. 
 The Company strives to continually enhance its knowledge base by creating competencies in emerging technical fields such as automation, artificial intelligence, Big Data analytics, cloud computing, mobile and embedded technologies, open source platforms, and social media. Syntels intelligent automation platform SyntBots® is gaining traction among clients and analysts. 
 Through these efforts, the Company delivers additional value to its clients, drives an expanded scope of work for existing customers, and creates greater efficiency in its own service delivery. 
 In order to protect the Companys intellectual property rights, the Company relies upon a combination of non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements as well as trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws. The Company enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, clients and potential clients, which limit access to and distribution of the Companys proprietary information. 
 Commitment to Client Success: Syntel aligns its objectives with those of its clients by committing to outcome-based delivery models such as fixed-price, fixed-time frame engagements. The Company also believes its ability to take ownership for its clients successes is an important competitive differentiator in the marketplace. The Company leverages its domain expertise, skilled technical resources and proprietary tools and methodologies to meet and exceed customer expectations on these engagements. 
 Global Delivery: Syntel performs its services on-site at customer locations, off-site at the Companys U.S. and European locations, and offshore at the Companys locations in Asia. By linking each of its service locations together through a dedicated data and voice network, Syntel provides a seamless service capability to its customers around the world, largely unconstrained by geographies, time zones and cultures. Syntels Global Delivery Model gives the Company the flexibility to deliver to each customer a unique mix of onsite, offsite, nearshore and offshore services to meet varying customer needs for direct interaction with Syntel personnel, access to technical and process expertise, resource availability and cost-effective delivery.

Measured by billable headcount, the percentage of services delivered from offshore centers was approximately 76% and 76% as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. 
 Selectively pursue partnership opportunities: The Company has entered into partnership alliances with numerous software product companies. These alliances combine the partners software capabilities with Syntels extensive implementation and delivery capabilities to drive value delivery to clients. Before entering into a partnership alliance, the Company considers a number of criteria, including: the technology employed, the industry served, the projected product lifecycle, the size of the potential market, the products integration requirements, and the reputation of the potential partner. 
 Attract and retain highly skilled professionals: The Company believes that employees are its most valuable asset, and that its success depends in large part upon the ability to attract, develop, motivate, retain and effectively utilize highly skilled professionals.

 Syntel aligns its service delivery model to every customer organizations IT strategy and preferred delivery model. For example, if the customers business requires fast delivery of a mission-critical application update, Syntel will combine on-site professionals with knowledge of the customers business processes and applications with its global infrastructure to deliver around-the-clock resources. If the customers primary goal is cost 
 
9 
 
 reduction, Syntel may increase the portion of work performed at its offshore Global Development Centers to significantly lower costs. The Company believes that its ability to provide flexible service delivery and access to resources permits responsiveness to customer needs and is an important factor that differentiates its services in the marketplace.
