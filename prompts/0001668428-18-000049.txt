Item 1. Business
Overview
FGL Holdings
FGL Holdings (the “Company”, formerly known as CF Corp.), a Cayman Islands exempted company, was originally incorporated in the Cayman Islands on February 26, 2016 as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. Prior to November 30, 2017, CF Corp. was a shell company with no operations. On November 30, 2017, CF Corp. consummated the acquisition of Fidelity & Guaranty Life, a Delaware corporation ("FGL") and its subsidiaries, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 24, 2017, as amended (the “Merger Agreement”). The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are referred to herein as the “Business Combination.” Prior to the Business Combination, approximately 80% of the outstanding shares of FGL’s common stock were owned indirectly by HRG Group, Inc.
In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, CF Corp. changed its name to “FGL Holdings” (the Company). Its trading symbols were historically quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbols “CFCOU,” “CFCO” and “CFCOW,” respectively. On December 1, 2017, the Company’s ordinary shares and warrants began trading on the NYSE under the symbols “FG” and “FG WS,” respectively. 
Upon the closing of the Business Combination, the Company paid $31.10, in cash, without interest, for each outstanding share of common stock of FGL (subject to certain exceptions), plus additional specified amounts in cash for outstanding equity incentives, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2 billion, plus the assumption of approximately $405 of existing FGL debt.
In addition, on the closing date of the Business Combination, FGL US Holdings Inc. (“FGLUS”), a Delaware corporation and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of (i) Front Street Re (Cayman) Ltd., an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability (“FSRC”) and (ii) Front Street Re Ltd., an exempted company incorporated in Bermuda with limited liability (“FSR” and, together with FSRC, the “FSR Companies”), from Front Street Re (Delaware) Ltd., a Delaware corporation (“FSRD”) and a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of HRG Group Inc. (“HRG”), for cash consideration of $65, subject to certain adjustments. 
In anticipation of the merger of the Company and FGL, a new Bermuda based reinsurance entity, F&G Re Ltd. (“F&G Re”) was formed. F&G Re and Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company (“FGLIC”) entered into a modified coinsurance treaty after the merger that effectively ceded 60% of FGLIC's inforce and new business to F&G Re, effective December 1, 2017. To capitalize F&G Re, FGLIC issued an extraordinary dividend of $665 to its non-insurance holding company parent, FGLH, who in turn issued a dividend to FGLUS, and FGLUS then used the funds to repay a short term loan from CF Bermuda Holdings Limited, a Bermuda exempted limited liability company and a wholly owned direct subsidiary of the Company (“CF Bermuda”). CF Bermuda then contributed the funds to F&G Re as a capital contribution. The $665 was primarily funded by a transfer of investments. In addition to the extraordinary dividend, F&G Re received a $85 capital dividend from its parent, CF Bermuda. 
Our Company
For more than 50 years, our Company has helped middle-income Americans prepare for retirement and for their loved ones' financial security. We partner with leading independent marketing organizations ("IMO") and their agents to serve the needs of the middle-income market and develop competitive products to align with their evolving needs. As of December 31, 2017 (Successor), we have 400,000 policyholders who count on the safety and protection features our fixed annuity and life insurance products provide. 
Through the efforts of our 304 employees, most of whom are located in Baltimore, MD and Des Moines, IA and through a network of 200 independent IMOs that in turn represent 36,000 independent agents. we offer various types of fixed annuities and life insurance products. Our fixed annuities serve as a retirement and savings tool for which our customers rely on principal protection and predictable income streams. In addition, our indexed universal life ("IUL") insurance products provide our customers with a complementary product that allows them to build on their savings and provide a payment to their designated beneficiaries upon the policyholder’s death. Our most popular products are fixed indexed annuities (“FIAs”) that tie contractual returns to specific market indices, such as the Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P") 500 Index. Our customers value our FIAs, which provide a 
7

portion of the gains of an underlying market index, while also providing principal protection. We believe this mix of “some upside but limited downside” fills the need for middle-income Americans who must save for retirement but who want to limit the risk of decline in their savings. 
In the Successor period from December 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, the Predecessor period from October 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017, and the Predecessor year ended September 30, 2017, FIAs generated approximately 75%, 71%, and 72% of our total sales, respectively. The remaining 25%, 29%, and 28% of sales, respectively, were primarily generated from fixed rate annuity sales during the periods. We invest the annuity premiums primarily in fixed income securities, options and futures that hedge our risk and replicate the market index returns to our policyholders. We invest predominantly in call options on the S&P 500 Index. The majority of our products contain provisions that permit us to adjust annually the formula by which we provide index credits in response to changing market conditions. In addition, our annuity contracts generally either cannot be surrendered or include surrender charges that discourage early redemptions. 
Our Strategy 
We seek to grow our business by pursuing a set of strategies aimed at delivering sustainable and profitable growth for shareholders; including: 

• | Protect Sales in Our Existing Market. We believe the demand for retirement and principal protection products in the IMO market will continue even under the Department of Labor "fiduciary" rule standards. Our focus will be on reconfiguring products and capabilities and partnering with the IMOs to continue to compete successfully and serve this important market's needs. 


• | Strengthen the Foundation. We will execute key initiatives that enhance our business capabilities and provide a platform for sustainable growth. 


• | Enhance the FGLH Experience. Building off the foundational initiatives, we continue efforts to create a more engaging, customer-focused experience through enhanced digital capabilities and improving the ease of doing business with us for our IMO partners, agents and customers. 


• | Leverage Product Capabilities for Additional Distribution. We capitalize on our manufacturing expertise and distribution partnerships to expand product reach. 


• | Bottom-line, Profit-oriented Objectives. We focus on initiatives to deliver target profits and avoid markets and products when industry pricing makes it difficult to achieve targeted profit margins.

Competition 
Our ability to compete is dependent upon many factors which include, among other things, our ability to develop competitive and profitable products, our ability to maintain stable relationships with our contracted IMOs, our ability to maintain low unit costs our ability to source and secure investments with attractive returns and risk profiles and our ability to maintain adequate financial strength ratings from rating agencies. Principal competitive factors for FIAs are initial crediting rates, reputation for renewal crediting action, product features, brand recognition, customer service, cost, distribution capabilities and financial strength ratings of the provider. Competition may affect, among other matters, both business growth and the pricing of our products and services. Principal competitive factors for IULs are based on service and distribution channel relationships, price, brand recognition, financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and financial stability.
For detailed information about revenues, operating income and total assets of our Company, see Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the financial statements beginning on page F-1 in this report.
Products 
Our experience designing and developing annuities and life insurance products will allow us to continue to introduce innovative products and solutions designed to meet customers’ changing needs. We work hand-in-hand with our distributors to devise the most suitable product solutions for the ever-changing market. We believe that, on a practical basis, we have a unique understanding of the safety, accumulation, protection, and income needs of middle-income Americans.

Annuity Products 
Through our insurance subsidiaries, we issue a broad portfolio of deferred annuities (fixed indexed and fixed rate annuities) and immediate annuities. A deferred annuity is a type of contract that accumulates value on a tax deferred basis and typically begins making specified periodic or lump sum payments a certain number of years after the contract has been issued. An immediate annuity is a type of contract that begins making specified payments within one annuity period (e.g., one month or one year) and typically pays principal and earnings in equal payments over some period of time. 
Deferred Annuities 
FIAs. Our FIAs allow contract owners the possibility of earning returns linked to the performance of a specified market index, predominantly the S&P 500 Index, while providing principal protection. The contracts include a provision for a minimum guaranteed surrender value calculated in accordance with applicable law. A market index tracks the performance of a specific group of stocks representing a particular segment of the market, or in some cases an entire market. For example, the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index is an index of 500 stocks intended to be representative of a broad segment of the market. All FIA products allow policyholders to allocate funds once a year among several different crediting strategies, including one or more index-based strategies and a traditional fixed rate strategy. High surrender charges apply for early withdrawal, typically for seven to fourteen years after purchase.
The contractholder account value of a FIA contract is equal to the sum of deposits paid, premium bonuses, if any, (described below), and index credits based on the change in the relevant market index, subject to a cap, spread and/or a participation rate less any fees for riders and less any withdrawals taken to-date. Caps (a maximum rate that may be credited) generally range from 2% to 6% when measured annually and 1% to 3% when measured monthly, spreads (a credited rate determined by deducting a specific rate from the index return), generally range from 1% to 6% when measured annually, and participation rates (a credited rate equal to a percentage of index return) generally range from 30% to 150% of the performance of the applicable market index. The cap, spread and participation rate can typically be reset annually and in some instances every two to five years. Certain riders provide a variety of benefits, such as the ability to increase their cap, lifetime income or additional liquidity for a set fee. As this fee is fixed, the contractholder may lose principal if the index credits received do not exceed the amount of such fee. 
Approximately 90%, 86%, and 88% of the FIA sales for the Successor period from December 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, the Predecessor period from October 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017, and the Predecessor year ended September 30, 2017, respectively, involved “premium bonuses” or vesting bonuses. Premium bonuses increase the initial annuity deposit by a specified rate of 2% to 4%. The vesting bonuses, which range from 1% to 9%, increase the initial annuity deposit liability but are subject to adjustment for unvested amounts in the event of surrender by the policyholder prior to the end of the vesting period. We made compensating adjustments in the commission paid to the agent or the surrender charges on the policy to offset the premium bonus. 
Approximately 85%, 88%, and 86% of our FIA contracts were issued with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) rider for the Successor period from December 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, the Predecessor period from October 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017, and the Predecessor year ended September 30, 2017, respectively. With this rider, a contract owner can elect to receive guaranteed payments for life from the FIA contract without requiring the owner to annuitize the FIA contract value. The amount of the living income benefit available is determined by the growth in the policy's benefit base value as defined in the FIA contract rider. Typically this accumulates for 10 years based on a guaranteed rate of 3% to 7%. Guaranteed withdrawal payments may be stopped and restarted at the election of the contract owner. Some of the FIA contract riders that we offer include an additional death benefit or an increase in benefit amounts under chronic health conditions. Rider fees range from 0% to 1%.

Fixed Rate Annuities. Fixed rate annuities include annual reset and multi-year rate guaranteed policies. Fixed rate annual reset annuities issued by us have an annual interest rate (the “crediting rate”) that is guaranteed for the first policy year. After the first policy year, we have the discretionary ability to change the crediting rate once annually to any rate at or above a guaranteed minimum rate. Multi-year guaranteed annuities are similar to fixed rate annual reset annuities except that the initial crediting rate is guaranteed for a specified number of years before it may be changed at our discretion. For the Successor period from December 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, the Predecessor period from October 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017, and the Predecessor year ended September 30, 2017, we sold $47, $114, and $546, respectively, of fixed rate multi-year guaranteed annuities. As of December 31, 2017 (Successor), crediting rates on outstanding (i) single-year guaranteed annuities generally ranged from 2% to 6% and (ii) multi-year guaranteed annuities ranged from 1% to 6%. The average crediting rate on all outstanding fixed rate annuities at December 31, 2017 (Successor) was 3%.
As of December 31, 2017 (Successor), the distribution of the fixed rate annuity account values by crediting rate was as follows: 

Crediting rate | 1% to 2% | | 2% to 3% | 3% to 4% | | 4% to 5% | 5% to 6% | | Total

2021 | 600 | 
2022 | 1,040 | 
Thereafter | 313 | 
Total | $ | 3,256

Withdrawal Options for Deferred Annuities. After the first year following the issuance of a deferred annuity policy, holders of deferred annuities are typically permitted penalty-free withdrawals up to 10% of the prior year’s value, subject to certain limitations. Withdrawals in excess of allowable penalty-free amounts are assessed a surrender charge if such withdrawals are made during the penalty period of the deferred annuity policy. The penalty period typically ranges from seven to fourteen years for FIAs and three to ten years for fixed rate annuities. This surrender charge initially ranges from 0% to 15% of the contract value for FIAs and 0% to 12% of the contract value for fixed rate annuities and generally decreases by approximately one to two percentage points per year during the penalty period. The average surrender charge is 8% for our FIAs and 6% for our fixed rate annuities as of December 31, 2017 (Successor). 
The following table summarizes our deferred annuity account values and surrender charge protection as of December 31, 2017 (Successor): 

 | Fixed and Fixed Index Annuities Account Value | | Percent of Total | | Weighted Average Surrender Charge
SURRENDER CHARGE EXPIRATION BY YEAR | | | | | 
Out of surrender charge | $ | 2,899 | | | 16% | | 0% | 
2018 | 1,250 | | | 7% | | 4% | 
2019 - 2020 | 1,913 | | | 11% | | 6% |

Thereafter | 7,007 | | | 39% | | 11% | 
Total | $ | 18,041 | | | 100% | | 7 | %

Subsequent to the penalty period, the policyholder may elect to take the proceeds of the surrender either in a single payment or in a series of payments over the life of the policyholder or for a fixed number of years (or a combination of these payment options). In addition to the foregoing withdrawal rights, policyholders may also elect to have additional withdrawal rights by purchasing a GMWB. 
Immediate Annuities 
We also sell single premium immediate annuities (or “SPIAs”), which provide a series of periodic payments for a fixed period of time or for the life of the policyholder, according to the policyholder’s choice at the time of issue. The amounts, frequency and length of time of the payments are fixed at the outset of the annuity contract. SPIAs are often purchased by persons at or near retirement age who desire a steady stream of payments over a future period of years.

Life Insurance 
We currently offer IUL insurance policies and have previously sold IUL, universal life, term and whole life insurance products. Holders of universal life insurance policies earn returns on their policies which are credited to the policyholder’s cash value account. The insurer periodically deducts its expenses and the cost of life insurance protection from the cash value account. The balance of the cash value account is credited interest at a fixed rate or returns based on the performance of a market index, or both, at the option of the policyholder, using a method similar to that described above for FIAs. 
Almost all of the life insurance policies in force, except for the return of premium benefits on term life insurance products, are subject to an arrangement with Wilton Reassurance Company (“Wilton Re”). See “Reinsurance-Wilton Re Transaction” within "Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies" to our audited consolidated financial statements.

Distribution 
The sale of our products typically occurs as part of a four-party, three stage sales process between FGLIC, an IMO, the agent and the customer. FGLIC designs, manufactures, issues, and services the product. The IMOs will typically sign contracts with multiple insurance carriers to provide their agents with a broad and competitive product portfolio. The IMO provides training and discusses product options with agents in preparation for meetings with clients. The IMO staff also provide assistance to the agent during the selling and application process. The agent may get customer leads from the IMOs. The agent conducts a fact find and present suitable product choices to the customers. We monitor the business issued by each distribution partner for pricing metrics, mortality, persistency, as well as market conduct and suitability. 
We offer our products through a network of approximately 200 IMOs, representing approximately 36,000 agents. We identify "Power Partners" as those we believe have the ability to generate significant production for the Company. We currently have 32 Power Partners, comprised of 21 annuity IMOs and 11 life insurance IMOs. During the Successor period from December 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, the Predecessor period from October 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017, and the Predecessor year ended September 30, 2017, these Power Partners accounted for approximately 95% of our annual sales volume. We believe that our relationships with these IMOs are strong. The average tenure of the top ten Power Partners is approximately 15 years. 
Our Power Partners play an important role in the development of our products by providing feedback integral to the development process and by securing “shelf space” for new products. Over the last ten years, the majority of our best-selling products have been developed with our Power Partners. We intend to continue to involve Power Partners in the development of our products in the future. 

The top five states for the distribution of FGLIC’s products in the Successor period from December 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, the Predecessor period from October 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017, and the Predecessor year ended September 30, 2017 were California, Florida, Michigan, Texas and New Jersey, which together accounted for 43% of FGLIC’s premiums. 
Investments 
We embrace a long-term conservative investment philosophy, investing nearly all the insurance premiums we receive in a wide range of fixed income interest-bearing securities. 
Upon the closing of the Business Combination, FGLIC entered into an investment management agreement (the “ FGLIC Investment Management Agreement”) with Blackstone ISG-I Advisors L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (“BISGA”), and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of The Blackstone Group L.P. (“Blackstone”). FGLIC appointed BISGA as investment manager ("Investment Manager") of FGLIC’s general account including the assets underlying the modified coinsurance agreement entered into with F&G Re (collectively, the “FGL Account”). BISGA has discretionary authority to manage the investment and reinvestment of the funds and assets of the FGL Account in accordance with the investment guidelines specified in the FGLIC Investment Management Agreement. Under the FGLIC Investment Management Agreement, it is expected that FGLIC will pay BISGA or its designee, from the assets of the FGL Account, the Management Fee which will equal 0.225% per annum during the first calendar year and 0.30% per annum thereafter. See "Note 14. Related Party Transactions" to the Company's consolidated financial statements for further details. Additionally, three subsidiaries of the Company in addition to FGLIC entered into Investment Management Agreements with BISGA on substantially the same terms as the FGLIC Investment Management Agreement (the “Additional Investment Management Agreements” and collectively with the FGLIC Investment Management Agreement, the “Investment Management Agreements”). 
BISGA manages the bulk of the investment portfolio. For certain asset classes, we utilize experienced third party companies. As of December 31, 2017 (Successor), 2% of our $22 billion fixed maturity investment portfolio was managed by FGL Holdings and 77% was managed by BISGA, with the remaining 21% balance managed by other third parties. Our investment strategy is designed to (i) achieve strong absolute returns, (ii) provide consistent yield and investment income, and (iii) preserve capital. We base all of our decisions on fundamental, bottom-up research, coupled with a top-down view that respects the cyclicality of certain asset classes. 
Upon the closing of the Business Combination, BISGA appointed MVB Management, a newly-formed entity owned by affiliates of the Company’s Co-Executive Chairmen, as Sub-Adviser of the FGL Account pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement (the “Sub-Advisory Agreement”). Under the Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Sub-Adviser 
13

will provide investment advisory services, portfolio review, and consultation with regard to the FGL Account (and the accounts of the other Company subsidiaries party to investment management agreements) and the asset classes and markets contemplated by the investment guidelines specified in the agreement, including such recommendations as the Investment Manager shall reasonably request. Payment or reimbursement of the subadvisory fee to the Sub-Adviser is solely the obligation of BISGA and is not an obligation of FGLIC or the Company. Subject to certain conditions, the Sub-Advisory Agreement cannot be terminated by BISGA unless FGLIC terminates the FGLIC Investment Management Agreement.
The types of assets in which we may invest are influenced by various state laws, which prescribe qualified investment assets applicable to insurance companies. Additionally, we define risk tolerance across a wide range of factors, including credit risk, liquidity risk, concentration (issuer and sector) risk, and caps on specific asset classes, which in turn establish conservative risk thresholds.
Our investment portfolio consists of high quality fixed maturities, including publicly issued and privately issued corporate bonds, municipal and other government bonds, asset-backed securities ("ABS"), residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS"), commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") and commercial mortgage loans ("CMLs"). We also maintain holdings in floating rate, and less rate-sensitive investments, including senior tranches of collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), non-agency RMBS, and various types of ABS. It is our expectation that our investment portfolio will broaden in scope and diversity to include other asset classes held by life and annuity insurance writers. We also have a small amount of equity holdings through our funding arrangement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. 
Portfolio Activity 
Over the last year, we continued to work with our internal asset management team and third party asset managers to broaden the portfolio’s exposure to include United States dollar ("USD") denominated emerging market bonds, highly rated preferred stocks and hybrids, and structured securities including ABS. 
As a result of these portfolio repositionings, we currently maintain: 

• | a well matched asset/liability profile (asset duration, including cash and cash equivalents, of 6.72 years vs. liability duration of 6.76 years); and


• | a large exposure to less rate-sensitive assets (16% of invested assets).

For further discussion of portfolio activity, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investment Portfolio”. 
Derivatives 
Our FIA contracts permit the holder to elect to receive a return based on an interest rate or the performance of a market index, most typically based on the S&P 500 Index. We purchase derivatives consisting predominantly of call options and, to a lesser degree, futures contracts on the equity indices underlying the applicable policy. These derivatives are used to fund the index credits due to policyholders under the FIA contracts based upon policyholders' contract elections. The majority of all such call options are one-year options purchased to match the funding requirements underlying the FIA contracts. On the anniversary dates of the FIA contracts, the market index used to compute the annual index credit under the FIA contract is reset. At such time, we purchase new one-, two-, three-, or five-year call options to fund the next index credit. We manage the cost of these purchases through the terms of our FIA contracts, which permit us to change caps or participation rates, subject to certain guaranteed minimums that must be maintained. The change in the fair value of the call options and futures contracts is generally designed to offset the equity market related change in the fair value of the FIA contract’s related reserve liability. The call options and futures contracts are marked to fair value with the change in fair value included as a component of "Net investment gains (losses)". The change in fair value of the call options and futures contracts includes the gains and losses recognized at the expiration of the instruments’ terms or upon early termination and the changes in fair value of open positions. 
Outsourcing 
We outsource the following functions to third-party service providers: 

• | new business administration (date entry and policy issue only);


• | service of existing policies;

14


• | underwriting administration of life insurance applications;


• | call centers;


• | information technology development and maintenance;


• | investment accounting and custody; and


• | hosting of financial systems.

We closely manage our outsourcing partners and integrate their services into our operations. We believe that outsourcing such functions allows us to focus capital and our employees on our core business operations and perform differentiating functions, such as investment, actuarial, product development and risk management functions. In addition, we believe an outsourcing model provides predictable pricing, service levels and volume capabilities and allows us to benefit from technological developments that enhance our customer self-service and sales processes. 
We outsource our new business and existing policy administration for annuity and life products to Transaction Applications Group, Inc. Under this arrangement, Transaction Applications Group, Inc. manages most of our call center and processing requirements. Our current agreement expires on December 31, 2021. Additionally, in August 2017, we partnered with Concentrix to administer a portion of our annuity new business processing and the servicing of these issued annuity contracts (administration and call center activities).
We have partnered with CRL-Plus (“CRL-Plus”) to implement our life insurance underwriting policies. Under the terms of the arrangement, CRL-Plus has assigned the Company a dedicated team of underwriters with appropriate professional designations and experience. Underwriting guidelines for each product are established by our Chief Underwriter in collaboration with our actuarial department. Our Chief Underwriter and actuarial department work closely with the applicable reinsurance company to establish or change guidelines. Adherence to underwriting guidelines is managed at a case level through monthly underwriting audits conducted by our Chief Underwriter as well as the CRL-Plus lead underwriter. Periodically, underwriting audits are conducted by our reinsurers. Our current agreement with CRL-Plus is reviewed annually. We believe that we have a good relationship with our principal outsource service providers. 
Ratings 
Our access to funding and our related cost of borrowing, the attractiveness of certain of our products to customers and requirements for derivatives collateral posting are affected by our credit ratings and insurance financial strength ratings, which are periodically reviewed by the rating agencies. Financial strength ratings and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products.
As of the date of this filing, A.M. Best Company ("A.M. Best"), Fitch Ratings ("Fitch"), Moody’s Investors Service ("Moody's") and S&P Global Ratings ("S&P") had issued credit ratings, financial strength ratings and/or outlook statements regarding us, as listed below. Following the completion of the merger with CF Corp., Fitch, Moody's and S&P initiated credit of financial strength ratings on FGL Holdings, CF Bermuda and F&G Re. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity’s ability to repay its indebtedness. Financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the ability of an insurance company to meet its financial obligations under an insurance policy and generally involve quantitative and qualitative evaluations by rating agencies of a company’s financial condition and operating performance. Generally, rating agencies base their financial strength ratings upon information furnished to them by the insurer and upon their own investigations, studies and assumptions. Financial strength ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders, agents and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors. Credit and financial strength ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization. 
In addition to the financial strength ratings, rating agencies use an “outlook statement” to indicate a medium or long term trend which, if continued, may lead to a rating change. A positive outlook indicates a rating may be raised and a negative outlook indicates a rating may be lowered. A stable outlook is assigned when ratings are not likely to be changed. A developing outlook is assigned when a rating may be raised, lowered, or affirmed. Outlooks should not be confused with expected stability of the issuer’s financial or economic performance. A rating may have a "stable" outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change, but a "stable" outlook does not preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time without notice.
15

The rating organizations may take various actions, positive or negative. Such actions are beyond the Company's control and the Company cannot predict what these actions may be and the timing thereof.

A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P review their ratings of insurance companies from time to time. There can be no assurance that any particular rating will continue for any given period of time or that it will not be changed or withdrawn entirely if, in their judgment, circumstances so warrant. While the degree to which ratings adjustments will affect sales and persistency is unknown, we believe if our ratings were to be negatively adjusted for any reason, we could experience a material decline in the sales of our products and the persistency of our existing business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.

Potential Impact of a Ratings Downgrade 
Under some International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ("ISDA") agreements, we have agreed to maintain certain financial strength ratings. A downgrade below these levels provides the counterparty under the agreement the right to terminate the open derivative contracts between the parties, at which time any amounts payable by us or the counterparty would be dependent on the market value of the underlying derivative contracts. Our current rating allows multiple counterparties the right to terminate ISDA agreements, at which time the counterparty would unwind existing positions for fair market value. No ISDA agreements have been terminated, although the counterparties have reserved the right to terminate the ISDA agreements at any time. As of December 31, 2017 (Successor), the amount due to the Company at risk for ISDA agreements which could be terminated based upon our current ratings was $492, which equals the fair value to us of the open over-the-counter call option positions. The fair value of the call options can never decrease below zero. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Credit Risk and Counterparty Risk”. 
In certain transactions, we and the counterparty have entered into a collateral support agreement requiring either party to post collateral when the net exposures exceed predetermined thresholds. These thresholds vary by counterparty and credit rating, however are generally zero. As of December 31, 2017 (Successor), September 30, 2017 (Predecessor) and 2016 (Predecessor), $467, $381 and $128, respectively, of collateral was posted by our counterparties. Accordingly, the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk that we would incur if parties to the call options failed completely to perform according to the terms of the contracts was $25, $32 and $148 at December 31, 2017 (Successor), September 30, 2017 (Predecessor) and 2016 (Predecessor), respectively. 
16

If the insurance subsidiaries held net short positions against a counterparty, and the subsidiaries’ financial strength ratings were below the levels required in the ISDA agreement with the counterparty, the counterparty would demand immediate further collateralization which could negatively impact overall liquidity. Based on the market value of our derivatives as of December 31, 2017 (Successor), September 30, 2017 (Predecessor) and 2016 (Predecessor), we hold no net short positions against a counterparty; therefore, there is currently no potential exposure for us to post collateral. 
A downgrade of the financial strength rating of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for us to market our products, as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings. A downgrade of the financial strength rating could also impact the Company's borrowing costs.
Risk Management 
Risk management is a critical part of our business. We seek to assess risk to our business through a formalized process involving (i) identifying short-term and long-term strategic and operational objectives, (ii) development of risk appetite statements that establish what the company is willing to accept in terms of risks to achieving its goals and objectives, (iii) identifying the levers that control the risk appetite of the company, (iv) establishing the overall limits of risk acceptable for a given risk driver, (v) establishing operational risk limits that are aligned with the tolerances, (vi) assigning risk limit quantification and mitigation responsibilities to individual team members within functional groups, (vii) analyzing the potential qualitative and quantitative impact of individual risks, including but not limited to stress and scenario testing covering over 8 economic and insurance related risks, (viii) mitigating risks by appropriate actions and (ix) identifying, documenting and communicating key business risks in a timely fashion. 
The responsibility for monitoring, evaluating and responding to risk is assigned first to our management and employees, second to those occupying specialist functions, such as legal compliance and risk teams, and third to those occupying supervisory functions, such as internal audit and the board of directors. 
In compliance with the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (ORSA), FGLIC submitted an ORSA report to the state regulators in November 2017 to provide risk management transparency and insight in the financial strength and long-term sustainability of the Companies. 
 Reinsurance 
We both cede reinsurance and assume reinsurance from other insurance companies. We use reinsurance to diversify risks, to manage loss exposures, to enhance our capital position, and to manage new business volume.
In instances where we are the ceding company, we pay a premium to a reinsurer in exchange for the reinsurer assuming a portion of our liabilities under the policies we issued and collect expense allowances in return for our administration of the ceded policies. Use of reinsurance does not discharge our liability as the ceding company because we remain directly liable to our policyholders and are required to pay the full amount of our policy obligations in the event that our reinsurers fail to satisfy their obligations. We collect reimbursement from our reinsurers when we pay claims on policies that are reinsured. In instances where we assume reinsurance from another insurance company, we accept, in exchange for a reinsurance premium, a portion of the liabilities of the other insurance company under the policies that the ceding company has issued to its policyholders. 
We monitor the credit risk related to the ability of our reinsurers to honor their obligations under various agreements. To minimize the risk of credit loss on such contracts, we generally diversify our exposures among many reinsurers and limit the amount of exposure to each based on financial strength ratings, which are reviewed at least quarterly. We are able to further manage risk via funds withheld arrangements.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of credit risk related to reinsurance agreements. A description of significant ceded reinsurance transactions appears below.
Wilton Re Transaction 
On January 26, 2011, FGL entered into an agreement (the “Commitment Agreement”) with Wilton Re U.S. Holdings, Inc. (“Wilton”), pursuant to which Wilton agreed to cause Wilton Re, its wholly-owned subsidiary, to enter into certain coinsurance arrangements with FGLIC following the closing of the FGLH acquisition. Pursuant to the Commitment Agreement, Wilton Re has reinsured a 100% quota share of certain of FGLIC’s policies that 
17

are subject to redundant reserves under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX, as well as another block of FGLIC’s in-force traditional, universal life and IUL insurance policies. 
Hannover Reinsurance Transaction
Effective January 1, 2017, the Company entered into a reinsurance agreement with Hannover Re, a third party reinsurer,  to reinsure an inforce block of its FIA and fixed deferred annuity contracts with  Guaranteed Minimum Withdraw Benefit (“GMWB”) and Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (“GMDB”) secondary guarantees.  In accordance with the terms of this agreement, the Company cedes 70% net retention of secondary guarantee payments in excess of account value for GMWB and GMDB guarantees. Effective July 1, 2017, the Company extended this agreement to include new business issued during 2017. 
Reserve Facilities and Intercompany Reinsurance
The CARVM Facility
Life insurance companies operating in the United States must calculate required reserves for life and annuity policies based on statutory principles. These methodologies are governed by “Regulation XXX” (applicable to term life insurance policies), “Guideline AXXX” (applicable to universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees) and the Commissioners Annuity Reserve Valuation Method, known as “CARVM” (applicable to annuities). Under Regulation XXX, Guideline AXXX and CARVM, insurers are required to establish statutory reserves for such policies that exceed economic reserves. The industry has reduced or eliminated redundancies thereby increasing capital using a variety of techniques including reserve facilities.
On October 5, 2012, FGLIC entered into a yearly renewable term indemnity reinsurance agreement with Raven Reinsurance Company ("Raven Re"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FGLIC (the “Raven Reinsurance Agreement”), pursuant to which FGLIC ceded a 100% quota share of its CARVM liability for annuity benefits where surrender charges are waived. To collateralize its obligations under the Raven Reinsurance Agreement, Raven Re entered into a reimbursement agreement with Nomura Bank International plc (“NBI”), an affiliate of Nomura Securities International, Inc., and FGL (the “Reimbursement Agreement”) whereby a subsidiary of NBI issued trust notes and NBI issued a $295 letter of credit that, in each case, were deposited into a reinsurance trust as collateral for Raven Re’s obligations under the Raven Reinsurance Agreement (the “NBI Facility”). Pursuant to the NBI Facility, FGLIC takes full credit on its statutory financial statements for the CARVM reserve ceded to Raven Re. The letter of credit facility automatically reduces each calendar quarter by $6. As of December 31, 2017 (Successor), there was $110 available under the letter of credit facility. Under the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement, in the event the letter of credit is drawn upon, Raven Re is required to repay the amounts utilized, and FGLH is obligated to repay the amounts utilized if Raven Re fails to make the required reimbursement. FGLH also is required to make capital contributions to Raven Re in the event that Raven Re’s statutory capital and surplus falls below certain defined levels. As of December 31, 2016 (Predecessor), Raven Re’s statutory capital and surplus was $24 in excess of the minimum level required under the Reimbursement Agreement. 
Effective April, 1 2017, FGLIC and Raven Re amended the reinsurance treaty and related trust and letter of credit agreements to extend the term of the letter of credit which would have matured on September 30, 2017 (Predecessor). The amendments added additional in-force business to the reinsurance treaty (fixed indexed annuities without a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider and multi-year guarantee annuities (“MYGA”) issued between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016). No initial ceding commission was paid or received by FGLIC or Raven Re in connection with the cession of additional in-force business. No assets were transferred to or from FGLIC or Raven Re in connection with the cession of additional in-force business. The amendments extended the letter of credit for an additional five year period and reduced the face amount of the letter of credit at April 1, 2017 from $183 to $115. The facility may terminate earlier in accordance with the Reimbursement Agreement.
The Front Street Reinsurance Transactions 
On December 31, 2012, following regulatory approval, FGLIC entered into a coinsurance agreement (the “Cayman Reinsurance Agreement”) with FSRC, at the time, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the Cayman Reinsurance Agreement, FSRC reinsured a 10% quota share percentage of certain FGLIC annuity liabilities of approximately $1 billion and the funds withheld assets are $1 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, FSRC paid an initial ceding allowance of $15 which was determined to be fair and reasonable according to an independent third-party actuarial firm. The coinsurance agreement is on a funds withheld basis, meaning that 
18

funds are withheld by FGLIC from the coinsurance premium owed to FSRC as collateral for FSRC’s payment obligations. Accordingly, the collateral assets remain under the ultimate ownership of FGLIC. See “Note 13. Reinsurance” to our audited consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2017 (Successor), ceded reserves are $1,035.
Effective September 17, 2014, FGLIC entered into a second reinsurance treaty with FSRC whereby FGLIC ceded 30% of any new business of its MYGA block of business on a funds withheld basis. This treaty was subsequently terminated as to new business effective April 30, 2015, but will remain in effect for policies ceded to FSRC with an effective date between September 17, 2014 and April 30, 2015.
As of December 31, 2017 (Successor), the reserves ceded as part of the reinsurance transactions are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Note 14. Related Party Transactions” to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements.
F&G Re Transaction
F&G Re is our licensed reinsurer registered in Bermuda and subject to the Bermuda Insurance Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. F&G Re and FGLIC entered into a modified coinsurance treaty that effectively ceded 60% of FGLIC's inforce to F&G Re and provides the ability to cede new business to F&G Re. To capitalize F&G Re, FGLIC issued an extraordinary dividend of $665 to its non-insurance holding company parent, FGLH, who in turn issued a dividend to FGLUS, and FGLUS then used the funds to repay a short term loan from CF Bermuda. CF Bermuda then contributed the funds to F&G Re as a capital contribution. The $665 was primarily funded by a transfer of investments. See “Note 14. Related Party Transactions” to the Company's audited Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to the extraordinary dividend, F&G Re received a $85 capital dividend from its parent, CF Bermuda. 
No policies issued by the Company have been reinsured with any foreign company, which is controlled, either directly or indirectly, by a party not primarily engaged in the business of insurance. 
The Company has not entered into any reinsurance agreements in which the reinsurer may unilaterally cancel any reinsurance for reasons other than non-payment of premiums or other similar credit issues. 
See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Credit Risk and Counterparty Risk”. 
Regulation 
Overview 
FGLIC, FGLICNY and Raven Re are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision in their domiciles, Iowa, New York and Vermont, respectively, and in each state in which they do business. FGLIC does business throughout the United States, except for New York. FGLICNY only does business in New York. Raven Re is a special purpose captive reinsurance company that only provides reinsurance to FGLIC under the CARVM Treaty. Following its redomestication from Maryland to Iowa, FGLIC’s principal insurance regulatory authority is the IID. State insurance departments throughout the United States also monitor FGLIC’s insurance operations as a licensed insurer. The New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) regulates the operations of FGLICNY, which is domiciled and licensed in New York. The purpose of these regulations is primarily to protect policyholders and beneficiaries and not general creditors and shareholders of those insurers. Many of the laws and regulations to which FGLIC and FGLICNY are subject are regularly re-examined and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect their operations. 
Generally, insurance products underwritten by and rates used by FGLIC and FGLICNY must be approved by the insurance regulators in each state in which they are sold. Those products are also substantially affected by federal and state tax laws. For example, changes in tax law could reduce or eliminate the tax-deferred accumulation of earnings on the deposits paid by the holders of annuities and life insurance products, which could make such products less attractive to potential purchasers. A shift away from life insurance and annuity products could reduce FGLIC’s and FGLICNY’s income from the sale of such products, as well as the assets upon which FGLIC and FGLICNY earn investment income. In addition, insurance products may also be subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"). 
19

State insurance authorities have broad administrative powers over FGLIC and FGLICNY with respect to all aspects of the insurance business including: 

• | licensing to transact business;


• | licensing agents;


• | prescribing which assets and liabilities are to be considered in determining statutory surplus;


• | regulating premium rates for certain insurance products;


• | approving policy forms and certain related materials;


• | determining whether a reasonable basis exists as to the suitability of the annuity purchase recommendations producers make;


• | regulating unfair trade and claims practices;


• | establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards;


• | regulating the amount of dividends that may be paid in any year;


• | regulating the availability of reinsurance or other substitute financing solutions, the terms thereof and the ability of an insurer to take credit on its financial statements for insurance ceded to reinsurers or other substitute financing solutions;


•


• | fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum accumulation or surrender values; and


• | regulating the type, amounts, and valuations of investments permitted, transactions with affiliates, and other matters.

Financial Regulation 
State insurance laws and regulations require FGLIC, FGLICNY and Raven Re to file reports, including financial statements, with state insurance departments in each state in which they do business, and their operations and accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time. FGLIC, FGLICNY and Raven Re prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments. 
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") has approved a series of statutory accounting principles and various model regulations that have been adopted, in some cases with certain modifications, by all state insurance departments. These statutory principles are subject to ongoing change and modification. Moreover, compliance with any particular regulator’s interpretation of a legal or accounting issue may not result in compliance with another regulator’s interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. Any particular regulator’s interpretation of a legal or accounting issue may change over time to FGLIC’s or FGLICNY’s detriment, or changes to the overall legal or market environment, even absent any change of interpretation by a particular regulator, may cause FGLIC and FGLICNY to change their views regarding the actions they need to take from a legal risk management perspective, which could necessitate changes to FGLIC’s or FGLICNY’s practices that may, in some cases, limit their ability to grow and improve profitability.
State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy and rate filings, market conduct and business practices of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. State insurance departments also have the authority to conduct examinations of non-domiciliary insurers that are licensed in their states. 
The Maryland Insurance Administration (“MIA”) completed a routine financial examination of FGLIC for the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, and found no material deficiencies and proposed no adjustments to the financial statements as filed. FGLIC has been informed that the IID will conduct a routine exam in 2018 for the 5 year period ending 2017. The NYDFS completed a routine financial examination of FGL NY for the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, and found no material deficiencies and proposed no adjustments to the financial statements as filed. The NYDFS is in the process of completing a routine financial examination of FGLICNY for the three-year periods ended December 31, 2012. The Vermont Department of Financial Regulation has completed a routine financial examination of Raven Re for the period from April 7, 2011 (commencement of 
20

business) through December 31, 2012. It found no material deficiencies and proposed no adjustments to the financial statements as filed. 
Dividend and Other Distribution Payment Limitations 
The Iowa insurance law and the New York insurance law regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid in any year by FGLIC and FGLICNY, respectively. Each year, FGLIC and FGLICNY may pay a certain limited amount of ordinary dividends or other distributions without being required to obtain the prior consent of the Iowa Insurance Commissioner (“Iowa Commissioner”) or the NYDFS, respectively. However, to pay any dividends or distributions (including the payment of any dividends or distributions for which prior consent is not required), FGLIC and FGLICNY must provide advance written notice to the Iowa Commissioner or the NYDFS, respectively. 
Pursuant to an order issued by the Iowa Commissioner on November 28, 2017 in connection with the approval of the Merger Agreement, FGLIC shall not pay any dividend or other distribution to shareholders prior to November 28, 2021 without the prior approval of the Iowa Commissioner. Additionally, F&G Re will not, for a period of three (3) years from November 28, 2017, declare, set aside or distribute any dividends or distributions other than solely (a) dividends or distributions that would be permitted in accordance with Section 521A.5(3) of the Iowa Code if F&G Re were a life insurance company domesticated in Iowa, upon prior written notice to the Iowa Commissioner, but limited only to the amount necessary to service interest payments on outstanding indebtedness and other obligations of CF Bermuda and FGLH, and (b) dividends or distributions upon written notice to, and with the prior written approval of, the Iowa Commissioner. 
Pursuant to Iowa insurance law, ordinary dividends are payments, together with all other such payments within the preceding twelve months, that do not exceed the greater of (i) 10% of FGLIC’s statutory surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31 of the preceding year; or (ii) the net gain from operations of FGLIC (excluding realized capital gains) for the 12-month period ending December 31 of the preceding year. 
Dividends in excess of FGLIC’s ordinary dividend capacity are referred to as extraordinary and require prior approval of the Iowa Commissioner. In deciding whether to approve a request to pay an extraordinary dividend, Iowa insurance law requires the Iowa Commissioner to consider the effect of the dividend payment on FGLIC’s surplus and financial condition generally and whether the payment of the dividend will cause FGLIC to fail to meet its required RBC ratio. Dividends may only be paid out of statutory earned surplus. 
In recent calendar years, the Company's insurance subsidiaries have had the dividend capacity and paid dividends to us as set forth in this table: 

 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 2013
FGLIC ordinary dividend capacity | $ | 132 | | | $ | 124 | | $ | 121 | $ | 124 | $ | 106
FGLIC ordinary dividends paid | 25 | | | — | | | — | | — | 40 | 
F&G Re dividend capacity | 201 | | | — | | | — | | — | — | 
FSRC dividend capacity | 66 | | | — | | | — | | — | — | 

Any payment of dividends by FGLIC is subject to the regulatory restrictions described above and the approval of such payment by the board of directors of FGLIC, which must consider various factors, including general economic and business conditions, tax considerations, FGLIC’s strategic plans, financial results and condition, FGLIC’s expansion plans, any contractual, legal or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends and its effect on RBC and such other factors the board of directors of FGLIC considers relevant. For example, payments of dividends could reduce FGLIC’s RBC and financial condition and lead to a reduction in FGLIC’s financial strength rating. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-A financial strength ratings downgrade, potential downgrade, or any other negative action by a rating agency could make our products less attractive and increase our cost of capital, and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations”. 
FGLICNY has historically not paid dividends. In 2012, FGLICNY paid a $4 dividend to FGLIC after a determination that, as a result of capital contributions by FGLIC, FGLICNY was overcapitalized. 
See "Item 1. Business-Bermuda Regulatory Framework-Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions" and "Item 1. Business-Cayman Islands Regulation" for further discussion on Bermuda and Cayman Island, respectively, dividend limitations that impact F&G Re and FSRC. 
21

 Surplus and Capital 
FGLIC and FGLICNY are subject to the supervision of the regulators in states where they are licensed to transact business. Regulators have discretionary authority in connection with the continuing licensing of these entities to limit or prohibit sales to policyholders if, in their judgment, the regulators determine that such entities have not maintained the minimum surplus or capital or that the further transaction of business will be hazardous to policyholders. 
Risk-Based Capital 
In order to enhance the regulation of insurers’ solvency, the NAIC adopted a model law to implement RBC requirements for life, health and property and casualty insurance companies. All states have adopted the NAIC’s model law or a substantially similar law. RBC is used to evaluate the adequacy of capital and surplus maintained by an insurance company in relation to risks associated with: (i) asset risk, (ii) insurance risk, (iii) interest rate risk, and (iv) business risk. In general, RBC is calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium and reserve items, taking into account the risk characteristics of the insurer. Within a given risk category, these factors are higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for items with lower underlying risk. The RBC formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. Insurers that have less statutory capital than the RBC calculation requires are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy. As of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the RBC ratios for FGLIC and FGLICNY each exceeded the minimum RBC requirements. 
It is desirable to maintain an RBC ratio in excess of the minimum requirements in order to maintain or improve our financial strength ratings. Our historical RBC ratios for FGLIC are presented in the table below. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-A financial strength ratings downgrade, potential downgrade, or any other negative action by a rating agency could make our product offerings less attractive and increase our cost of capital, and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations”. 

 | RBC Ratio 
As of: | | 
December 31, 2017 | 499 | %
December 31, 2016 | 412 | %
December 31, 2015 | 401 | %
December 31, 2014 | 388 | %
December 31, 2013 | 423 | %
December 31, 2012 | 406 | %

See "Item 1. Business-Bermuda Regulatory Framework-ECR and Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirements" for discussing on Bermuda regulatory requirements that impact F&G Re.
Insurance Regulatory Information System Tests 
The NAIC has developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System ("IRIS") to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of U.S. insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or action by insurance regulatory authorities. A ratio falling outside the prescribed “usual range” is not considered a failing result. Rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. In many cases, it is not unusual for financially sound companies to have one or more ratios that fall outside the usual range. Insurance companies generally submit data annually to the NAIC, which in turn analyzes the data using prescribed financial data ratios, each with defined “usual ranges”. Generally, regulators will begin to investigate or monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. IRIS consists of a statistical phase and an analytical phase whereby financial examiners review insurers’ annual statements and financial ratios. The statistical phase consists of 12 key financial ratios based on year-end data that are generated from the NAIC database annually; each ratio has a “usual range” of results. As of December 31, 2017 (Successor), FGLIC had two ratios outside the usual range.  FGLICNY and Raven Re each had four ratios outside the usual range.  The IRIS ratio for change in reserving for both FGLIC and FGLICNY was outside the usual range.  The IRIS ratio for change in premium for both FGLICNY 
22

and Raven Re was outside the usual range.  In addition, Raven Re’s IRIS ratio for adequacy of investment income also fell outside the usual range.
In all instances in prior years, regulators have been satisfied upon follow-up that no regulatory action was required. FGLIC, FGLICNY and Raven Re are not currently subject to regulatory restrictions based on these ratios. 
Insurance Reserves 
State insurance laws require insurers to analyze the adequacy of reserves. The respective appointed actuaries for FGLIC, FGLICNY and Raven Re must each submit an opinion on an annual basis that their respective reserves, when considered in light of the respective assets FGLIC, FGLICNY and Raven Re hold with respect to those reserves, make adequate provision for the contractual obligations and related expenses of FGLIC, FGLICNY and Raven Re. FGLIC, FGLICNY and Raven Re have filed all of the required opinions with the insurance departments in the states in which they do business. 
Credit for Reinsurance Regulation 
States regulate the extent to which insurers are permitted to take credit on their financial statements for the financial obligations that the insurers cede to reinsurers. Where an insurer cedes obligations to a reinsurer which is neither licensed nor accredited by the state insurance department, the ceding insurer is not permitted to take such financial statement credit unless the unlicensed or unaccredited reinsurer secures the liabilities it will owe under the reinsurance contract. Under the laws regulating credit for reinsurance issued by such unlicensed or unaccredited reinsurers, the permissible means of securing such liabilities are (i) the establishment of a trust account by the reinsurer to hold certain qualifying assets in a qualified U.S. financial institution, such as a member of the Federal Reserve, with the ceding insurer as the exclusive beneficiary of such trust account with the unconditional right to demand, without notice to the reinsurer, that the trustee pay over to it the assets in the trust account equal to the liabilities owed by the reinsurer; (ii) the posting of an unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit by a qualified U.S. financial institution in favor of the ceding company allowing the ceding company to draw upon the letter of credit up to the amount of the unpaid liabilities of the reinsurer and (iii) a “funds withheld” arrangement by which the ceding company withholds transfer to the reinsurer of the reserves which support the liabilities to be owed by the reinsurer, with the ceding insurer retaining title to and exclusive control over such reserves. In addition, on January 1, 2014, the NAIC Model Credit for Reinsurance Act became effective in Iowa, which adds the concept of “certified reinsurer”, whereby a ceding insurer may take financial statement credit for reinsurance provided by an unaccredited and unlicensed reinsurer which has been certified by the Iowa Commissioner. The Iowa Commissioner certifies reinsurers based on several factors, including their financial strength ratings, and imposes collateral requirements based on such factors. FGLIC and FGLICNY are subject to such credit for reinsurance rules in Iowa and New York, respectively, insofar as they enter into any reinsurance contracts with reinsurers which are neither licensed nor accredited in Iowa and New York, respectively. 
Insurance Holding Company Regulation 
As the parent company of FGLIC and the indirect parent company of FGLICNY, we and entities affiliated for purposes of insurance regulation are subject to the insurance holding company laws in Iowa and New York. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance department in the insurance company’s state of domicile and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system. Generally, all transactions between insurers and affiliates within the holding company system are subject to regulation and must be fair and reasonable, and may require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by its domiciliary insurance regulator. 
Most states, including Iowa and New York, have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change of control of an insurer or an insurer’s holding company. Such laws prevent any person from acquiring control, directly or indirectly, of FGL Holdings, CF Bermuda, F&G Re, FGLH, FGLIC or FGLICNY unless that person has filed a statement with specified information with the insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval. In addition, investors deemed to have a direct or indirect controlling interest are required to make regulatory filings and respond to regulatory inquiries. Under most states’ statutes, including those of Iowa and New York, acquiring 10% or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered a change of control, although such presumption may be rebutted. Accordingly, any person who acquires 10% or more of our voting securities or that of FGL Holdings, CF Bermuda, F&G Re, FGLH, FGLIC or FGLICNY without the prior approval of the insurance regulators of Iowa and New York will be in violation of 
23

those states’ laws and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the relevant insurance regulator or prohibiting the voting of those securities and to other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulator. 
Insurance Guaranty Association Assessments 
Each state has insurance guaranty association laws under which insurers doing business in the state may be assessed by state insurance guaranty associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Typically, states assess each member insurer in an amount related to the member insurer’s proportionate share of the business written by all member insurers in the state. Although no prediction can be made as to the amount and timing of any future assessments under these laws, FGLIC and FGLICNY have established reserves that they believe are adequate for assessments relating to insurance companies that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings. 
Market Conduct Regulation 
State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure to consumers, illustrations, advertising, sales and complaint process practices. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations. In addition, FGLIC and FGLICNY must file, and in many jurisdictions and for some lines of business obtain regulatory approval for, rates and forms relating to the insurance written in the jurisdictions in which they operate. FGLIC is currently the subject of four ongoing market conduct examinations in various states. Market conduct examinations can result in monetary fines or remediation and generally require FGLIC to devote significant resources to the management of such examinations. FGLIC does not believe that any of the current market conduct examinations it is subject to will result in any fines or remediation orders that will be material to its business. 
Regulation of Investments 
FGLIC and FGLICNY are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain asset categories, such as below investment grade fixed income securities, equity, real estate, other equity investments and derivatives. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as either non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring surplus or as not qualified as an asset held for reserve purposes and, in some instances, would require divestiture or replacement of such non-qualifying investments. We believe that the investment portfolios of FGLIC and FGLICNY as of December 31, 2017 (Successor) complied in all material respects with such regulations. 
Bermuda Regulation
F&G Re is a Bermuda exempted company incorporated under the Companies Act 1981, as amended (the “Companies Act”) and is registered as a Class C insurer under the Insurance Act 1978, as amended, and its related regulations (the “Insurance Act”). FSR is a Bermuda exempted company incorporated under the Companies Act and is registered as a Class C insurer under the Insurance Act. Each of F&G Re and FSR are regulated by the BMA. 
The Insurance Act provides that no person may carry on an insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer under the Insurance Act by the BMA. In deciding whether to grant registration, the BMA has broad discretion to act as it thinks fit in the public interest. The BMA is required by the Insurance Act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and, in particular, whether it has, or has available to it, adequate knowledge and expertise. The registration of an applicant as an insurer is subject to the insurer complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the BMA may impose at any time. The Insurance Act also grants to the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies.
The BMA has enacted various legislative and regulatory amendments to the Insurance Act to aid in Bermuda’s achievement of regulatory equivalence with that of the European Commission’s Solvency II framework in relation to commercial insurance entities. Bermuda has been awarded full equivalence for commercial insurers under Europe’s Solvency II regime applicable to insurance companies, which regime came into effect on January 1, 2016. The Insurance Amendment Act 2015 (No. 2) (“Act No. 2”) and the Insurance Amendment Act 2015 (No. 3) (“Act 
24

No. 3”) were proposed during 2015 as part of the BMA’s objective of receiving Solvency II equivalency. Act No. 2 and Act No. 3 were approved by the Bermuda Parliament with the majority of the changes becoming operative on January 1, 2016. Act No. 2 and Act No. 3 materially amend the Insurance Act including to: (i) require certain classes of insurers (including each of F&G Re and FSR) to maintain their head offices in Bermuda; (ii) require insurers to notify the BMA of any reduction or disposal of shares taking a shareholder controller below 10%, 20%, 33% or 50%; (iii) permit certain classes of insurers to submit condensed audited GAAP financial statements; and (iv) establish the minimum criteria of matters of material significance whereby the approved auditor is required to provide written notice to the BMA of those matters that would impact the BMA’s discharge of its functions under the Insurance Act. The Act No. 3 also materially amends the items and the content of the documents to be submitted as part of the required statutory financial returns for Class C insurers carrying on long-term business, pursuant to the Insurance Accounts Rules 2016. The Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Class C, Class D and Class E Solvency Requirement) Amendment Rules 2015 effective as of January 1, 2016 expands the prudential standards of the Insurance Act to generally include the requirement of insurers to meet regulatory capital and reporting requirements on a statutory economic capital and surplus basis. Further amendments to the Insurance Act provide that all insurers are now required to implement corporate governance policies and processes as the BMA considers appropriate given the nature, size, complexity and risk profile of the insurer and all insurers, on an annual basis, are now required to deliver a declaration to the BMA confirming whether or not they meet the minimum criteria for registration. The Insurance (Public Disclosure) Rules 2015 requires all Class C insurers to produce and publish a Financial Condition Report on their website, or provide a copy to the public on request if they do not have a website, as part of its annual Bermuda Capital and Solvency requirement. The Financial Condition Report provides particulars on the business performance, governance structure, risk profile, solvency valuation, and capital management of the insurer.
The Bermuda Insurance Code of Conduct (the “Bermuda Insurance Code”), which is a codification of best practices for insurers provided by the BMA, was also amended in 2015 and all insurers had to be in compliance by December 31, 2015. Substantive revisions to the Bermuda Insurance Code included a new requirement for the board of an insurer to ensure that its insurance manager is both fit and able to carry out its duties to ensure that the insurer operates in a prudent manner and a clarification that only limited purpose insurers will be allowed to outsource the CEO and senior executive roles to an insurance manager.
The BMA utilizes a risk-based approach when it comes to licensing and supervising insurance and reinsurance companies. As part of the BMA’s risk-based system, an assessment of the inherent risks within each particular class of insurer or reinsurer is used to determine the limitations and specific requirements that may be imposed. Thereafter the BMA keeps its analysis of relative risk within individual institutions under review on an ongoing basis, including through the scrutiny of audited financial statements, and, as appropriate, meeting with senior management during onsite visits.
Bermuda Regulatory Framework
The Insurance Act imposes on Bermuda insurance companies solvency and liquidity standards, as well as auditing and reporting requirements. Certain significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below.
Principal Representative, Head and Principal Office. Every registered insurer or reinsurer is required to maintain a principal office in Bermuda and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda, subject to certain prescribed requirements under the Insurance Act. Further, any registered insurer that is a Class C insurer or above is required to maintain a head office in Bermuda and direct and manage its insurance business from Bermuda. The 2015 amendments to the Insurance Act provided that in considering whether an insurer satisfies the requirements of having its head office in Bermuda, the BMA may consider (a) where the underwriting, risk management and operational decision making occurs; (b) whether the presence of senior executives who are responsible for, and involved in, the decision making are located in Bermuda; and (c) where meetings of the board of directors occur. The BMA will also consider (a) the location where management meets to effect policy decisions; (b) the residence of the officers, insurance managers or employees; and (c) the residence of one or more directors in Bermuda. Additionally, the BMA may look to the location of the insurance manager for determining whether a head office is in Bermuda.
For the purpose of the Insurance Act, each of F&G Re’s and FSR’s principal office is their respective executive offices at Sterling House, 16 Wesley Street, Hamilton HM CX, Bermuda. F&G Re has appointed and approved 
25

Marsh Management Services (Bermuda) Ltd. as its principal representative. FSR has appointed and approved Will Rinehimer as its principal representative. The principal representative has statutory reporting duties under the Insurance Act for certain reportable events, such as threatened insolvency or non-compliance with the Insurance Act or with a condition or restriction imposed on an insurer.
Approved Actuary. Generally, a Class C insurer is required to submit annually an opinion of its approved actuary with its financial statements and return in respect of the insurer’s economic balance sheet technical provisions and a certificate as to the amount of the insurer’s liabilities outstanding on account of its long-term business. However, an insurer may file an application under the Insurance Act to waive the aforementioned requirements. 
Annual Statutory Financial Statements and Return; Independent Approved Auditor. The Insurance Act generally requires all insurers to: (i) prepare annual statutory financial statements and returns; (ii) submit a declaration certifying compliance with the minimum criteria applicable to it including the minimum margin of solvency, enhanced capital requirements and any restrictions or conditions imposed on its license; and (iii) appoint an independent auditor who will annually audit and report on such financial statements and returns.
The independent auditor of the insurer must be approved by the BMA and may be the same person or firm that audits the insurer’s financial statements and reports for presentation to its shareholders. If the insurer fails to appoint an approved auditor or at any time fails to fill a vacancy for such auditor, the BMA may appoint an approved auditor for the insurer and shall fix the remuneration to be paid to the approved auditor. The approved auditor is required to issue written notice to the BMA of matters of material significance for the discharge of the BMA’s functions as established under the Insurance Act. An insurer may file an application under the Insurance Act to have the requirement to file audited statutory financial statements annually with the BMA waived. Each of F&G Re’s and FSR’s independent auditor has been approved by the BMA.
Minimum Solvency Margin. The Insurance Act provides that the value of the assets of an insurer must exceed the value of its liabilities by an amount greater than its prescribed minimum solvency margin.
The minimum solvency margin that must be maintained by a Class C insurer is the greater of: (i) $500,000; (ii) 1.5% of assets; and (iii) 25% of that insurer’s enhanced capital requirement (“ECR”). An insurer may file an application under the Insurance Act to waive the aforementioned requirements. 
ECR and Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirements (“BSCR”). Class C insurers are required to maintain available capital and surplus at a level equal to or in excess of the applicable ECR, which is established by reference to either the applicable BSCR model or an approved internal capital model. Furthermore, to enable the BMA to better assess the quality of the insurer’s capital resources, a Class C insurer is required to disclose the makeup of its capital in accordance with its 3-tiered capital system. An insurer may file an application under the Insurance Act to have the aforementioned ECR requirements waived.
Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions. In addition to the requirements under the Companies Act (as discussed below), the Insurance Act limits the maximum amount of annual dividends and distributions that may be paid or distributed by F&G Re and FSR without prior regulatory approval.
Each of F&G Re and FSR is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if it fails to meet its minimum solvency margin, or ECR, or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause such breach. Additionally, annual distributions that would result in a reduction of the insurer’s prior year-end balance of statutory capital and surplus by more than 25% also requires the prior approval of the BMA.
If F&G Re or FSR were to fail to meet its minimum solvency margin on the last day of any financial year, it would be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the BMA.
In addition, as Class C insurers, each of F&G Re and FSR must: (i) not make any payment from its long-term business fund for any purpose other than a purpose of the insurer’s long-term business, except in so far as such payment can be made out of any surplus certified by the insurer’s approved actuary to be available for distribution otherwise than to policyholders; and (ii) not declare or pay a dividend to any person other than a policyholder unless the value of the assets of its long-term business fund, as certified by the insurer’s approved 
26

actuary, exceeds the extent (as to certified) of the liabilities of the insurer’s long-term business. In the event a dividend complies with the above, each of F&G Re and FSR must ensure the amount of any such dividend does not exceed the aggregate of (i) that excess and (ii) any other funds properly available for the payment of dividend, being funds arising out of business of the insurer other than long-term business. 
The Companies Act also limits F&G Re’s and FSR’s ability to pay dividends and make distributions to its shareholders. Each of F&G Re and FSR is not permitted to declare or pay a dividend, or make a distribution out of its contributed surplus, if it is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or if the realizable value of its assets would be less than its liabilities.
Reduction of Capital.   Each of F&G Re and FSR may not reduce its total statutory capital by 15% or more, as set out in its previous year’s financial statements, unless it has received the prior approval of the BMA. Total statutory capital consists of the insurer’s paid in share capital, its contributed surplus (sometimes called additional paid in capital) and any other fixed capital designated by the BMA as statutory capital.
Cayman Islands Regulation
FSRC is licensed as a class B insurer only in the Cayman Islands by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (“CIMA”) and it does not intend to obtain a license in any other jurisdiction. The suspension or revocation of FSRC’s license to do business as a reinsurance company in the Cayman Islands for any reason would mean that it would not be able to enter into any new reinsurance contracts until the suspension ended or it became licensed in another jurisdiction. Any such suspension or revocation of its license would negatively impact its reputation in the reinsurance marketplace and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.
As a regulated insurance company, FSRC is subject to the supervision of CIMA and CIMA may at any time direct FSRC, in relation to a policy, a line of business or the entire business, to cease or refrain from committing an act or pursing a course of conduct and to perform such acts as in the opinion of CIMA are necessary to remedy or ameliorate the situation. 
The laws and regulations of the Cayman Islands require that, among other things, FSRC maintain minimum levels of statutory capital, surplus and liquidity, meet solvency standards, submit to periodic examinations of its financial condition and restrict payments of dividends and reductions of capital. Statutes, regulations and policies that FSRC is subject to may also restrict the ability of FSRC to write insurance and reinsurance policies, make certain investments and distribute funds. Any failure to meet the applicable requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements could subject it to further examination or corrective action by CIMA, including restrictions on dividend payments, limitations on our writing of additional business or engaging in finance activities, supervision or liquidation.
Privacy Regulation 
Our operations are subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations that require financial institutions and other businesses to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information, including health-related and customer information, and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information and their practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of such information. These laws and regulations require notice to affected individuals, law enforcement agencies, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain personal information, including social security numbers, and require holders of certain personal information to protect the security of the data. Our operations are also subject to certain federal regulations that require financial institutions and creditors to implement effective programs to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft. In addition, our ability to make telemarketing calls and to send unsolicited e-mail or fax messages to consumers and customers and our uses of certain personal information, including consumer report information, are regulated. Federal and state governments and regulatory bodies may be expected to consider additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of personal information. 
FIAs 
In recent years, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and state securities regulators have questioned whether FIAs, such as those sold by us, should be treated as securities under the federal and state securities laws rather than as insurance products exempted from such laws. Treatment of these products as securities 
27

would require additional registration and licensing of these products and the agents selling them, as well as cause us to seek additional marketing relationships for these products, any of which may impose significant restrictions on our ability to conduct operations as currently operated. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, annuities that meet specific requirements, including requirements relating to certain state suitability rules, are specifically exempted from being treated as securities by the SEC. We expect that the types of FIAs FGLIC and FGLICNY sell will meet these requirements and therefore are exempt from being treated as securities by the SEC and state securities regulators. However, there can be no assurance that federal or state securities laws or state insurance laws and regulations will not be amended or interpreted to impose further requirements on FIAs. 
The Dodd-Frank Act 
The Dodd-Frank Act makes sweeping changes to the regulation of financial services entities, products and markets. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are or may become applicable to us, our competitors or those entities with which we do business, including, but not limited to: 

• | the establishment of federal regulatory authority over derivatives;


• | the establishment of consolidated federal regulation and resolution authority over systemically important financial services firms;


• | the establishment of the Federal Insurance Office;


• | changes to the regulation of broker dealers and investment advisors;


• | changes to the regulation of reinsurance;


• | changes to regulations affecting the rights of shareholders;


• | the imposition of additional regulation over credit rating agencies;


•


• | the imposition of concentration limits on financial institutions that restrict the amount of credit that may be extended to a single person or entity; and


• | the clearing of derivative contracts.

Numerous provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require the adoption of implementing rules or regulations, some of which have been implemented. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislation or regulation applicable to the insurance industry, us, our competitors or those entities with which we do business. Legislative or regulatory requirements imposed by or promulgated in connection with the Dodd-Frank Act may impact us in many ways, including, but not limited to: 

• | placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competition or other financial services entities;


• | changing the competitive landscape of the financial services sector or the insurance industry;


• | making it more expensive for us to conduct our business;


• | requiring the reallocation of significant company resources to government affairs;


• | increasing our legal and compliance related activities and the costs associated therewith; or


• | otherwise having a material adverse effect on the overall business climate as well as our financial condition and results of operations.

Until various studies are completed and final regulations are promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on investments, investment activities and insurance and annuity products of FGLIC and FGLICNY remains unclear. 
ERISA 
We may offer certain insurance and annuity products to employee benefit plans governed by ERISA and/or the Code, including group annuity contracts designated to fund tax-qualified retirement plans. ERISA and the Code provide (among other requirements) standards of conduct for employee benefit plan fiduciaries, including investment managers and investment advisers with respect to the assets of such plans, and holds fiduciaries liable if they fail to satisfy fiduciary standards of conduct. 
In April 2016, the Department of Labor (“DOL”) issued the “fiduciary” rule which could have a material impact on the Company, its products, distribution, and business model. The rule provides that persons who render investment advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to an employer plan or individual retirement account 
28

(“IRA”) are fiduciaries of that plan or IRA. The rule expands the definition of fiduciary under ERISA to apply to insurance agents who advise and sell products to IRA owners. As a result, commissioned insurance agents selling the Company’s IRA products must qualify for a prohibited transaction exemption, either the newly introduced Best Interest Contract Exemption (BICE) or amended PTE 84-24. When fully implemented, BICE would apply to fixed indexed annuities and amended PTE 84-24 would apply to fixed rate annuities. The rule and exemptions have been the subject of much controversy and various actions have been taken by DOL to delay and reconsider aspects of the rule and exemptions. The rule took effect June 2016 and was scheduled to become applicable in April 2017 but the “applicability date" was delayed by DOL for 60 days from April 10, 2017 to June 9, 2017. DOL also acted to delay many aspects of the prohibited transaction exemption requirements during a transition period from June 9, 2017 to January 1, 2018 provided the agent (and if applicable, financial institution) comply with “impartial conduct standards.” The impartial conduct standards essentially require the sale to be in the “best interest” of the client, misleading statements not be made, and compensation be reasonable. More recently, DOL has extended the transition period to July 1, 2019. Industry continues its efforts to overturn the rule in court actions and Congress continues to consider related legislation but the success or failure of these efforts cannot be predicted. Assuming the rule is not overturned and the requirements of the exemptions were to be implemented fully, the impact on the financial services industry generally and on the Company and its business in particular is difficult to assess. We believe however it could have an adverse effect on sales of annuity products to IRA owners particularly in the independent agent distribution channel. A significant portion of our annuity sales are to IRAs. Compliance with the prohibited transaction exemptions when fully phased in would likely require additional supervision of agents, cause changes to compensation practices and product offerings, and increase litigation risk, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. FGLIC will continue to monitor developments closely and believes it is prepared to execute implementation plans as necessary to meet the rule and exemption requirements on the requisite applicability dates.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017 (Successor), the Company had 304 employees. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees. 
FGL Holdings Available Information

FSR Companies
FSRC is an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and subsidiary of FGL Holdings. FSR, a Bermuda company, was formed in March 2010 to act as a long-term reinsurer. FSRC was formed in the Cayman Islands and on October 24, 2012, received from the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority a license to carry on business as an Unrestricted Class “B” Insurer that permits FSRC to conduct offshore direct and reinsurance business. FSR and FSRC are parties to reinsurance transactions.
Strategy
The FSR Companies were formed with the intention of building a flexible and diversified portfolio of life and annuity reinsurance treaties. FSRC may also conduct hedging and other investment activities. FSR has not entered into any reinsurance agreements as of December 31, 2017.
Competition
The reinsurance industry is highly competitive. The FSR Companies compete with major reinsurers, most of which are well established and have significant operating histories, strong financial strength ratings and long-
29

standing client relationships. The FSR Companies’ competitors include Athene Life Re Ltd., Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited, Guggenheim Life and Annuity Company, Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated, Legal & General Reinsurance Company Ltd., and Resolution Life Holdings, Inc., as well as smaller companies and other niche reinsurers. The FSR Companies operate in a highly competitive industry, which could limit its abilities to gain or maintain its respective position in the industry and could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, the FSR Companies had one employee, which was not represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The FSR Companies believes that its overall relationship with its employee is good.
