2. Overview of Business
 
We develop, manufacture, distribute and market innovative, cost-effective and environmentally safe bio-technological products for agriculture. Our products are designed to enhance the quality of human life by increasing the value, quality and productivity of crops and decreasing the negative environmental impact of chemicals and other wastes.
Our Products
 
We have developed three bio-fertilizer products with bacillus species (“bacillus spp”) and/or photosynthetic bacteria as core ingredients. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we are currently generating revenues from two of our three bio-fertilizer products: 1) Biological Organic Fertilizer and 2) Compound Microbial Fertilizer. We expect to add one more bio-fertilizer product, 3) Bio-Water Soluble Fertilizer, to our revenue sources in 2018 and it is expecting to launch sometime in the third quarter of 2018.
 
Some of our products contain ingredients of both photosynthesis and bacillus bacteria. Bacillus spp is a species of bacteria that interacts with plants and promotes biological processes. It is highly effective for promoting plant growth, enhancing yield, improving quality and elevating resistances. Photosynthetic bacteria are a group of green and purple bacteria. Bacterial photosynthesis differs from green plant photosynthesis in that bacterial photosynthesis occurs in an anaerobic environment and does not produce oxygen. Photosynthetic bacteria can enhance the photosynthetic capacity of green plants by increasing the utilization of sunlight, which helps keep the photosynthetic process at a vigorous level, enhances the capacity of plants to transform inorganic materials to organic products, and boosts overall plant health and productivity.

Intellectual Property 
 
Our bacillus bacteria based fertilizers are protected by patents. In 2004, we acquired patent no. ZL 93101635.5 entitled “Highly Effective Composite Bacteria for Enhancing Yield and the Related Methodology for Manufacturing” from China Agricultural University (“CAU”) for the aggregate purchase of $480,411, consisting of $60,411 in cash and 5,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $84.00 per share (aggregate value of $420,000). Our photosynthetic bacteria based fertilizers are also protected by trade secret laws.
 
The patent acquired from CAU covers six different species of bacillus which have been tested as bio-fertilizers to enhance yield and plant health. The production methods of the six species are also patented. The patent has expired on February 19, 2013.There are no limitations under this agreement on our exclusive use of the patent. Pursuant to our agreement with CAU, the University agreed to provide research and technology support services at no additional cost to us in the event we decide to use the patent to produce commercial products. These research and technology support services include: (1) furnishing faculty or graduate-level researchers to help bacteria culturing, sampling, testing, trial production and production formula adjustment; (2) providing production technology and procedures to turn the products into powder form while keeping live required bacteria in the products; (3) establishing quality standards and quality control systems; (4) providing testing and research support for us to obtain necessary sale permits from the Chinese government; and (5) cooperation in developing derivative products.
 
On January 5, 2011, the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC (“Intellectual Property Office”) granted Kiwa two Certificates of Patent of Invention for (1) “A cucumber dedicated composite anti-continuous cropping effect probiotics and their specific strains with related application” with patent number of “ZL 2008 1 0144492.6”; and (2) “Cotton dedicated composite anti-continuous cropping effect probiotics and their special strains with related application” with patent number of “ZL 2008 1 0144491.1” These two patents have been developed by Kiwa-CAU R&D Center. These two patents will expire on August 5, 2028. These two patents can be used to develop specific environment-friendly bio-fertilizer.
 
We have obtained three fertilizer registration certificates from the Chinese government - two covering our bacillus bacteria fertilizer and one covering our photosynthetic bacteria fertilizer. The five registration certificates are: (1) Biological Organic Fertilizer Registration Certificate issued by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture; (2) Compound Microbial Fertilizer Registration Certificate issued by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture; (3) Compound Microbial Water Soluble Fertilizer Registration Certificate issued by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture. Protected by these three fertilizer registration certificates and five trademarks under the names of “KANGTAN” (Chinese translation name for Kiwa), “ZHIGUANGYOU,” “PUGUANGFU,” “JINWA” and “KANGGUAN,” we have developed three series of bio-fertilizer products with bacillus spp and/or photosynthetic bacteria as core ingredients. Valid period of fertilizer registration certificates is five years and may be extended for another five years upon application from the owner of fertilizer registration certificates. The Company has determined to re-apply the Fertilizer Registration Certificate issued by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture.

Our Competition
 
We compete primarily on the basis of quality, technological innovation and price. Some of our competitors have achieved greater market penetration but with less sophisticated technological innovation than our products as there were in the transition period from being the chemical bio-fertilizer producers to the organically bio-fertilizer producers. We believe that we have a better competitive advantage over them as we are the pioneer within our markets. Some of our competitors competed within our markets have lesser financial and other resources than us as they have established their companies a few years behind us. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits could be reduced.
Our main competitors include China Green Agriculture, Inc., Genliduo Biotechnology Ltd., Shenzhen Baitan Ecotypic Engineering Co. Ltd., Hunan Taigu Biotechnology Co. Ltd. and Shanxi A.K. Quantum Agricultural Technology Corporation.
 
Kiwa-CAU Research and Development Center
 
In July 2006, we established a new research center with China Agricultural University (“CAU”) which is known as Kiwa-CAU Bio-Tech Research & Development Center (the “Kiwa-CAU R&D Center”). Pursuant to an agreement between CAU and Kiwa Shandong dated November 14, 2006, Kiwa agreed to contribute RMB 1 million (approximately $160,000) each year to fund research at Kiwa-CAU R&D Center. The term of this agreement was ten years starting from July 1, 2006. Prof. Qi Wang, who became one of our directors in July 2007, has acted as the Director of Kiwa-CAU R&D Center since July 2006. Under the above agreement, the Kiwa-CAU R&D Center is responsible for fulfilling the overall research-and-development functions of Kiwa Shandong, including: (1) development of new technologies and new products (which will be shared by Kiwa and CAU); (2) subsequent perfection of existing product-related technologies; and (3) training quality-control personnel and technicians and technical support for marketing activities.
 
During fiscal 2014, Kiwa-CAU R&D Center had successfully isolated several strains of endophytic bacillus from plants. A number of strains had been observed to have the capability of boosting crop yield and dispelling chemical pesticide residual from soil. These strains could be used for developing not only new biological preparation but also environmental protection preparation. The Company terminated its cooperation with CAU when the agreement expired on July 1, 2016. All the liabilities owed to Kiwa-CAU R&D Center were assumed by the Transferee of Kiwa Shandong when the Company disposed Kiwa Shandong on Feb 11, 2017.
 
On November 5, 2015, the Company signed a strategic cooperation agreement (the “Agreement”) with China Academy of Agricultural Science (“CAAS”)’s Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning (“IARRP”) and Institute of Agricultural Economy & Development (“IAED”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will form a strategic partnership with the two institutes and establish an “International Cooperation Platform for Internet and Safe Agricultural Products”. To fund the cooperation platform’s R&D activities, the Company will provide RMB 1 million (approximately $160,000) per year to the Spatial Agriculture Planning Method & Applications Innovation Team that belongs to the Institute. The term of the Agreement is for three years beginning November 20, 2015. However, the Company is only liable for the annual funds to be provided to the extent of the contract obligations performed by CAAS IARRP and IAED, and the agreement is terminable before the three years’ commitment date based on negotiations of both parties. Prof. Yong Chang Wu, the authorized representative of IARRP, CAAS, is also one of the Company’s directors effective since November 20, 2015 until March 13, 2017.

On February 23, 2017, the Company agreed to a strategic relationship with ETS (Tianjin) Biological Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd. (“ETS”). The partnership will include the deployment and strategic use of ETS biotechnology to produce of bio-fertilizers for use in both China and internationally. Kiwa and ETS, together with the certain Chinese government departments, will work together to enhance China’s microbial fertilizer industry standards and China’s food safety industry chain standards. The parties will work together on the development of microbial technology and products in agriculture, environmental protection, soil management and other fields. Relying on the Chinese Academy of Sciences, ETS Environmental and Agricultural Microbial Technology Research Center and biotechnology project research results, Kiwa has introduced the ETS core technology to complete bio-fertilizer upgrading, transformation and to develop new product lines. In order to meet the growing global consumer demand to increase food supply and develop sustainable farming we are applying sustainable use of biotechnology and the use of biotechnology products to replace chemical products, which will strengthen environmental protection and promote international cooperation. As a result of strict management of many agricultural chemicals, such chemicals will continue to be abandoned, resulting is a growing demand for bio-fertilizers. It has been widely accepted that the application of ETS biotechnology facilitates agricultural sustainability and helps to protect the soil and improve grain output. The technology focuses on keeping soil healthy by restoring healthy microbes that are naturally present in healthy soils. As the technology gains worldwide recognition, it is imperative to popularize bio-fertilizer in developing countries to fulfill the needs of growing populations and promote environmentally friendly agriculture. Through the cooperation of Kiwa and ETS, the parties aim to enhance the usage of the bio-fertilizers in China. The cooperation will bring technological transformation and support for Kiwa to improve its existing manufacturing techniques. Kiwa and ETS will also collaborate to establish a comprehensive platform for producing, supplying, and marketing in China. Ultimately, Kiwa would look to introduce these products to the international market, including the United States.
