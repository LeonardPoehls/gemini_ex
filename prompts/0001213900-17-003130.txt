Item 1.    Business.General
 
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we use the terms "Carbon," "Company," "we," "our," and "us" to refer to Carbon Natural Gas Company and its subsidiaries. In the following discussion, we make statements that may be deemed "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). See "Forward-Looking Statements," below, for more details. We also use a number of terms used in the oil and gas industry. See "Glossary of Oil and Gas Terms" for the definition of certain terms.
 
Carbon Natural Gas Company is a Delaware corporation, originally formed in Indiana in 1959, which owns and operates oil and natural gas and oil interests in the Appalachian and Illinois Basins of the United States. It produces and sells oil, natural gas, natural gas condensate and natural gas liquids. Carbon’s acreage is held and its exploration and production activities are conducted indirectly through majority-owned subsidiaries. 
 

● | Nytis Exploration (USA) Inc. (“Nytis USA”) was organized as a Delaware corporation in 2004. Pursuant to the Merger, Nytis USA is owned 100% by Carbon. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In 2005 Nytis USA acquired oil and natural gas interests (owned by Addington Exploration, LLC (“Addington”)) located in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia. To acquire the Addington assets, Nytis USA formed (along with a different unaffiliated person) Nytis Exploration Company LLC (“Nytis LLC”). Nytis LLC is owned 98.1% by Nytis USA. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On January 31, 2011, Nytis USA entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with St. Lawrence Seaway Corporation (“SLSC”), which was closed on February 14, 2011. At that date, SLSC acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Nytis USA from the Nytis USA stockholders, and thereby became the indirect owner of all of Nytis USA’s equity interests in Nytis LLC. In exchange for the issuance by SLSC to the Nytis USA stockholders of 47,000,003 restricted shares of SLSC common stock (which then constituted 98.9% of SLSC’s issued and outstanding common stock), Nytis USA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of SLSC, and Nytis LLC became a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of SLSC (the “Merger”). The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were intended to be a “tax-free” reorganization under Sections 351 and/or 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Prior to the Merger closing, SLSC was a “shell company” (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)), with no operations and nominal cash assets. As a result of the Merger, SLSC exited shell company status as of February 17, 2011, when it filed a Form 8-K with complete “Form 10 Information” as required by Item 2.01(f) of Form 8-K. On May 2, 2011, SLSC’s name was changed to Carbon Natural Gas Company.

Strategy
 
Our strategy is to create shareholder value through consistent growth in cash flows, production and reserves through drilling on existing properties and the acquisition of complementary properties. We emphasize the development of the Company’s existing leasehold which consists primarily of low risk, repeatable resource plays. We invest significantly in technical staff and geological and engineering technology to enhance the value of our properties.
 
Principal strategy components:
 

● | Concentrate resources in core operating areas. Our focus on the Appalachian and Illinois Basins allows the Company to capitalize on its regional expertise to optimize drilling and completion techniques and to create production and reserve growth. Numerous objective reservoirs permit us to allocate capital among opportunities based on risked well economics, with a view to balancing the portfolio to achieve consistent and profitable growth in production and reserves. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Some of our proved reserves and resources are classified as unconventional, including fractured shale formations, tight gas sands, and coalbed methane. Our technical team has significant experience in drilling vertical, horizontal and directional wells, as well as fracture stimulation of unconventional formations. We utilize geological, drilling and completion technologies to enhance the predictability and repeatability of finding and recovering hydrocarbons in these unconventional plays. 


● | Oil development. The Company has, since 2011, focused on the drilling of its oil prospects and the Company expects to continue to allocate capital to oil drilling activities as economic conditions allow. During this time, we have enhanced our well performance, improved well drilling and completion performance, including reduced drilling days, increased horizontal lateral length, decreased cost per frac stage and reduced days from spud to first production. In addition we have established an infrastructure of oil and natural gas gathering and salt water handling and disposal facilities which will benefit the economics of future drilling. We continue to acquire leases and producing properties where we have identified additional potential to expand our oil development activities. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Gas development. Another area of focus of our drilling and completion activities is the development of a coalbed methane resource located in the Illinois Basin. The Company has approximately 62,000 net mineral acres in Indiana and Illinois which are prospective for the development of coalbed methane. The Company also owns an interest in related natural gas gathering and compression and salt water disposal facilities. Since 2006, we have conducted a drilling program in the Seelyville coal formation, including participating as a 50% joint venture partners in the drilling of 36 vertical and two horizontal wells. During 2015, the Company participated in the drilling of 25 stratigraphic wells to identify potential future horizontal locations in the Seelyville coal formation. If natural gas prices support further development of the resource, we may drill additional wells. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Acquisitions. Our strategy is to increase our reserves and operating cash flows through the acquisition of complementary properties. In October 2016, the Company completed an acquisition of approximately 2,300 natural gas wells located primarily in West Virginia. In February 2017, the Company through its ownership of Carbon California Company, LLC, completed acquisitions of oil and gas assets in the Ventura Basin of California. The Company will continue to focus on the acquisition of complementary properties. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proven executive management team with track record of value creation. Our management and technical personnel have extensive experience operating in the Appalachian and Illinois Basins. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Low-risk development drilling in established resource plays, and flexibility in deployment of exploration, development and infrastructure capital. The Company’s acreage positions provide multiple resource play opportunities. At an appropriate level of oil and natural gas prices, the Company has a multi-year drilling inventory of potential horizontal drilling locations on existing acreage. Carbon has drilled or participated in over 166 vertical or horizontal wells from January 2005 through December 31, 2016. Our leasehold position has been delineated largely through drilling done by us, as well as with other industry players. Our leasehold position is largely comprised of leases held-by-production or long-term leases, neither of which require any near term obligatory capital expenditures. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Low cost operation. Our geographic and operating focus and the shallow nature of our drilling activities and producing wells results in relatively low finding and development and lease operating costs. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maintain financial flexibility and conservative financial position. We typically use cash flow from operations and our bank credit facility with LegacyTexas Bank to fund drilling, completion and acquisition activities and in the past have accessed outside capital through the use of joint ventures or similar arrangements. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Control over operating decisions and capital program. At December 31, 2016, we operated approximately 96% of the wells in which we have a working interest. The high percentage of operated wells allows us to manage the timing of capital expenditures, lease operating expenses and the marketing of oil and natural gas production. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Manage commodity price exposure through an active hedging program. We maintain a hedging program designed to reduce exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. As of December 31, 2016, we have outstanding natural gas hedges of approximately 3.4 million MMBtu for 2017 at an average price of $3.30 per MMBtu, approximately 3.1 million MMBtu for 2018 at an average price of $3.01 per MMBtu and approximately 1.3 million MMBtu for 2019 at an average price of $2.85 per MMBtu. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we have outstanding oil hedges of 60,000 barrels for 2017 at an average price of $52.98 per barrel, 48,000 barrels for 2018 at an average price of $54.11 per barrel and 36,000 barrels for 2019 at an average price of $54.90 per barrel. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Manage midstream assets and secure firm takeaway capacity. We own natural gas gathering and compression facilities in the Appalachian and Illinois Basins. We believe that owning gathering and compression facilities allows us to decrease dependence on third parties, and to better manage the timing of our asset development and to receive higher netback pricing from the markets in which we sell our production. We have secured long-term firm takeaway capacity on various natural gas pipelines to accommodate the transportation and marketing of certain of our existing and expected production.

Acquisition and Divestiture Activities
 
We pursue acquisitions that meet our criteria for investment returns and are consistent with our low-risk development focus. Acquisitions in and around our existing core areas enable us to leverage our cost control abilities, technical expertise, and existing land and infrastructure positions. Our acquisition program has focused on acquisitions of properties that have development drilling opportunities and undeveloped acreage. We have also evaluated producing oil properties with field development potential in California. The following is a summary of our significant acquisitions and divestitures that influenced the last two years. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Recent Developments” for more information on our acquisitions and dispositions.
Acquisitions
 
In October 2016, Nytis LLC completed an acquisition (the “EXCO Acquisition”) consisting of producing natural gas wells and natural gas gathering facilities located primarily in West Virginia. The acquisition was pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement, effective October 1, 2016 (the “EXCO Purchase Agreement”), by and among EXCO Production Company (WV), LLC, BG Production Company (WV), LLC and EXCO Resources (PA) LLC (collectively, the “Sellers”) and Nytis LLC, as the buyer. The purchase price of the acquired assets pursuant to the EXCO Purchase Agreement was $9.0 million subject to customary closing adjustments plus certain assumed obligations.
 
The acquired assets significantly increased the natural gas production and reserves of the Company and are expected to increase cash flow, reduce general and administrative expenses (per unit of production) and provide an inventory of development projects. The acquired assets consisted of the following:
 

● | Approximately 2,300 natural gas wells and over 900 miles of associated natural gas gathering pipelines and compression facilities operated by the Company. As of December 31, 2016, these wells were producing approximately 9,000 net Mcfe per day (97% natural gas). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Average working and net revenue interest of the acquired wells of 94% and 79%, respectively. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Estimated proved developed producing reserves of approximately 46.4 Bcfe (97% natural gas). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Approximately 201,000 net acres of oil and natural gas mineral interests. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Divestitures
 
During December 2014, Nytis LLC together with Liberty Energy LLC (“Liberty”) (the “Sellers”) completed a preliminary closing in accordance with a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “PSA”) entered into during October 2014 for the sale of a portion of Nytis LLC’s interest in rights below the base of the Clinton Formation (the “Deep Rights”) underlying certain oil and gas leases located in Kentucky and West Virginia.
 
Pursuant to the PSA, the Sellers reserved (i) a minority working interest in the Deep Rights, (ii) an overriding royalty interest in certain of the Deep Rights and (iii) all rights from the surface to the base of the Clinton formation underlying the leases. In connection with the closing of this transaction, Nytis LLC received approximately $12.4 million in cash with the proceeds from the sale recorded as a reduction of the Company’s investment in its proved and unevaluated oil and natural gas properties.
 
In June 2015, the final closing was completed. In connection with the final closing, Nytis LLC received an additional $42,000 in cash.

Preparation of Reserves Estimates
 
Our proved oil and natural gas reserves estimates as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were based on the average fiscal-year prices for oil and natural gas (calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the month price for each month within the 12-month period ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively). Proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Proved undeveloped reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those locations on development spacing areas that are offsetting economic producers that are reasonably certain of economic production when drilled. Proved undeveloped reserves for other undrilled development spacing areas are claimed only where it can be demonstrated with reasonable certainty that there is continuity of economic production from the existing productive formation. Proved undeveloped reserves are included when they are scheduled to be drilled within five years.
 
SEC rules dictate the types of technologies that a company may use to establish reserve estimates including the extraction of non-traditional resources, such as natural gas extracted from shales as well as bitumen extracted from oil sands. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our estimated proved reserves.
 
Uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating subsurface accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and its interpretation. As a result, estimates by different engineers often vary, sometimes significantly. In addition, physical factors such as the results of drilling, testing, and production subsequent to the date of an estimate, as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices or development and production expenses, may require revision of such estimates. Accordingly, quantities of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered will vary from reserve estimates. See “Risk Factors,” for a description of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business and reserves.
 
Reserve estimates are based on production performance, data acquired remotely or in wells, and are guided by petrophysical, geologic, geophysical, and reservoir engineering models. Estimates of our proved reserves were based on deterministic methods. In the case of mature developed reserves, reserve estimates are determined by decline curve analysis and in the case of immature developed and undeveloped reserves, by analogy, using proximate or otherwise appropriate examples in addition to volumetric analysis. The technologies and economic data used in estimating our proved reserves include empirical evidence through drilling results and well performance, well logs and test data, geologic maps and available downhole and production data. Further, the internal review process of our wells and related reserve estimates includes but is not limited to the following:
 

● | A comparison is made and documented of actual data from our accounting system to the data utilized in the reserve database. Current production, revenue and expense information obtained from the Company’s accounting records are subject to external quarterly reviews, annual audits and additional internal controls over financial reporting. This process is designed to create assurance that production, revenues and expenses are accurately reflected in the reserve database. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A comparison is made and documented of land and lease records to ownership interest data in the reserve database. This process is designed to create assurance that the costs and revenues utilized in the reserves estimation match actual ownership interests. 
● | A comparison is made of property acquisitions, disposals, retirements or transfers to the property records maintained in the reserve database to verify that all are accounted for accurately. 
● | Natural gas pricing for the first flow day of every month is obtained from Platts Gas Daily. Oil pricing for the first flow day of every month is obtained from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. At the reporting date, 12-month average prices are determined. Regional variations in pricing and related deductions are similarly obtained and a 12-month average is calculated at year end. 

 
For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Carbon’s independent engineering firm, Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“CGA”) reviewed with Carbon technical personnel field performance and future development plans. Following these reviews, Carbon’s internal reserve database and supporting data was furnished to CGA in order for them to prepare their independent reserve estimates and final report. Access to the Company’s database containing reserve information is restricted to select individuals from our engineering department. CGA’s independent reserve estimates and final report is for the Company’s interest in the respective oil and gas properties and represents 100% of the total proved hydrocarbon reserves owned by the Company or 96% of the consolidated proved hydrocarbon reserves presented in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. CGA’s report does not include the hydrocarbon reserves owned by the non-controlling interests of the consolidated partnerships. The Company calculated the estimated reserves and related PV-10 of the non-controlling interests of the consolidated partnerships’ oil and gas properties by multiplying CG&A’s independent reserve estimates for such properties by the respective non-controlling interests in those properties.

Drilling Activities
 
Based on current and expected prices for oil and natural gas during 2016 and 2015, we reduced our drilling activity to manage and optimize the utilization of our capital resources. During 2016, our capital expenditures, other than for oil and natural gas property acquisitions, consisted principally of expanding our gathering facilities to provide greater flexibility in moving our natural gas to markets with more favorable pricing.
 
The following table summarizes the number of wells drilled for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Gross wells reflect the sum of all wells in which we own an interest. Net wells reflect the sum of our working interests in gross wells.

The Company
 
Marketing and Delivery Commitments
 
Our oil and natural gas production is generally sold on a month-to-month basis in the spot market, priced in reference to published indices. We believe that the loss of one or more of our purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our production, because any individual purchaser could be readily replaced by another purchaser, absent a broad market disruption. 
 
The Company has historically sold a portion of its gas through fixed price physical delivery contracts to effectively provide gas price hedges. 
 
The Company has entered into firm transportation contracts to ensure the transport of certain of its gas production to purchasers. Firm transportation volumes and related demand charges for the remaining term of these contracts at December 31, 2016 are summarized in the table below.
 

Period | Dekatherms per day | | Demand Charges | 
--------------------+--------------------+-------+----------------+--
Jan 2017 - Apr 2018 | | 5,530 | | $ | 0.20 - $0.65
May 2018 - Mar 2020 | | 3,230 | | $ | 0.20 - $0.62
Apr 2020 – May 2020 | | 2,150 | | $ | 0.20 
Jun 2020 – May 2036 | | 1,000 | | $ | 0.20 

Competition
 
We encounter competition in all aspects of our business, including acquisition of properties and oil and natural gas leases, marketing oil and natural gas, obtaining services and labor, and securing drilling rigs and other equipment and materials necessary for drilling and completing wells. Our ability to increase reserves in the future will depend on our ability to generate successful prospects on our existing properties, execute development drilling programs, and acquire additional producing properties and leases for future development and exploration. A number of the companies with which we compete with have larger staffs and greater financial and operational resources than we have. Because of the nature of our oil and natural gas assets and management’s experience in developing our reserves and acquiring properties, we believe that we effectively compete in our markets. See— Risk Factor “Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel.”
Regulation
 
Federal, state, and local agencies have extensive rules and regulations applicable to our oil and natural gas exploration, production and related operations. These laws and regulations may change in response to economic or political conditions. Matters subject to current governmental regulation and/or pending legislative or regulatory changes include the discharge or other release into the environment of wastes and other substances in connection with drilling and production activities (including fracture stimulation operations), bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling risks and well plugging and abandonment, reclamation or restoration costs, reports concerning our operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties, taxation, and the use of derivative hedging instruments. Failure to comply with laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions that could delay, limit, or prohibit certain of our operations. In the past, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production. In order to conserve supplies of oil and gas, oil and gas conservation commissions and other agencies may restrict the rates of flow of wells below actual production capacity, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and may impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. Further, a significant spill from one of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position, or financial condition. The laws regulate, among other things, the production, handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of oil and natural gas, by-products from each, and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with our operations. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations, such laws and regulations may be amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations.
 
Most states require drilling permits, drilling and operating bonds and the filing of various reports and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Many states also have statutes or regulations regarding conservation matters including rules governing the size of drilling and spacing units, the density of wells and the unitization of oil and natural gas properties. The federal and state regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increase our cost of doing business and affects our profitability.

Federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the prices received for natural gas production. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale or resale of natural gas in interstate commerce. In 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”), which amends the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”) to make it unlawful for any entity, including non-jurisdictional producers such as Carbon, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the FERC, or contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. EPAct 2005 also gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA up to $1,000,000 per day per violation. The anti-manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” natural gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. It therefore reflects a significant expansion of the FERC’s enforcement authority. We do not anticipate we will be affected any differently than other producers of natural gas in respect of EPAct 2005.
 
In 2007, the FERC issued rules requiring that any market participant, including a producer such as Carbon, that engages in physical sales for resale or purchases for resale of natural gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million MMBtus during a calendar year, must annually report such sales or purchases to the FERC, beginning on May 1, 2009. These rules are intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale natural gas markets and to assist the FERC in monitoring such markets and in detecting market manipulation. In 2008, the FERC issued its order on rehearing, which largely approved the existing rules, except the FERC exempted from the reporting requirement certain types of purchases and sales, including purchases and sales of unprocessed natural gas and bundled sales of natural gas made pursuant to state regulated retail tariffs. In addition, the FERC clarified that other end use purchases and sales are not exempt from the reporting requirements. The monitoring and reporting required by the rules have increased our administrative costs. Carbon does not anticipate it will be affected any differently than other producers of natural gas.
 
Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the FERC, and the courts. For instance, legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress to amend the federal Safe Drinking Water Act to subject hydraulic fracturing operations—an important process used in the completion of our oil and natural gas wells—to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. If adopted, this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation, and impose additional cost, on our operations. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposal, or any additional new legislative or regulatory proposal, may become effective. No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the federal government.
 
Our sales of oil and natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. Interstate transportation of oil and natural gas by pipelines is regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. Intrastate oil and natural gas pipeline transportation rates may also be subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. We do not believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will affect our operations in any way that is materially different that those of our competitors who are similarly situated.
 
Environmental
 
As an operator of oil and natural gas properties in the U.S., we are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection as well as the manner in which various substances, including wastes generated in connection with exploration, production, and transportation operations, are released into the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations can affect the location or size of wells and facilities, prohibit or limit the extent to which exploration and development may be allowed, and require proper closure of wells and restoration of properties when production ceases. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, imposition of remedial obligations, incurrence of capital or increased operating costs to comply with governmental standards, and even injunctions that limit or prohibit exploration and production activities or that constrain the disposal of substances generated by oil field operations.
 
The most significant of these environmental laws that may apply to our operations are as follows:
 

● | The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”) and comparable state statutes which impose liability on owners and operators of certain sites and on persons who dispose of or arrange for the disposal of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substances releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. Parties responsible for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances under CERCLA may by subject to liability for the cost of cleaning up those substances and for damages to natural resources; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), subjects owners and operators of facilities to strict and several liability for containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from oil spills, including the government’s response costs. Spills subject to the OPA may result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state statues which govern the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and analogous state laws that govern the discharge of pollutants, including natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters, including spills and leaks of hydrocarbons and produced water. In April 2015, the EPA proposed new CWA regulations that would prevent onshore unconventional oil and gas wells from discharging wastewater pollutants into public treatment facilities. In June 2015, the EPA adopted a new regulatory definition of “waters of the U.S.,” which governs which waters and wetlands are subject to the CWA. Implementation of the regulation has been stayed pending challenges to the regulation filed in federal court. Depending on whether and how the new definition is implemented, it could significantly expand the jurisdictional reach of the CWA in many states;

● | The Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and similar state and local requirements which govern the emission of pollutants into the air. Greenhouse gas record keeping and reporting requirements under the CAA took effect in 2011 and impose increased administrative and control costs. In August 2015, the EPA proposed new regulations under the CAA to reduce methane emissions from new and modified sources in the oil and gas sector. These regulations were finalized in May 2016.

We currently operate or lease, and have in the past operated or leased, a number of properties that have been subject to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties operated or leased by us or on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, these properties may have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to laws and regulations imposing joint and several liability and strict liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct that could require us to remove previously disposed wastes or remediate property contamination, or to perform well or pit closure or other actions of a remedial nature to prevent future contamination.
 
Oil and natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations. It is customary in our industry to recover oil and natural gas from these formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is the process of injecting substances such as water, sand, and other additives under pressure into subsurface formations to create or expand fractures, thus creating a passageway for the release of oil and natural gas.
 
Essentially all of our Appalachian Basin oil and natural gas reserves are subject to or have been subjected to hydraulic fracturing and we expect to continue to employ hydraulic fracturing extensively in future wells that we drill and complete. The reservoir rock in these areas, in general, has insufficient permeability to flow enough oil or natural gas to be economically viable without stimulation. The controlling regulatory agencies for well construction have standards that are designed specifically in anticipation of hydraulic fracturing. The cost of the stimulation process varies according to well location and reservoir.
 
We contract with established service companies to conduct our hydraulic fracturing. The personnel of these service companies are trained to handle potentially hazardous materials and possess emergency protocols and equipment to deal with potential spills and carry Material Safety Data Sheets for all chemicals. We require these service companies to carry insurance covering incidents that could occur in connection with their activities. In addition, these service companies are responsible for obtaining any regulatory permits necessary for them to perform their service in the relevant geographic location. We have not had any incidents, citations or lawsuits resulting from hydraulic fracture stimulation and we are not presently aware of any such matters.
 
In the well completion and production process, an accidental release could result in possible environmental damage. All wells have manifolds with escape lines to containment areas. High pressure valves for flow control are on the wellhead. Valves and piping are designed for higher pressures than are typically encountered. Piping is tested prior to any procedure and regular safety inspections and incident drill records are kept on those tests.
 
All fracturing is designed with the minimum water requirements necessary since there is a cost of accumulating, storing and disposing of the water recovered from fracturing. Water is drawn from nearby streams that are tributaries to the Ohio River and flow 365 days per year. Water recovered from the fracturing is injected into EPA or state approved water injection wells.
 
While hydraulic fracturing historically has been regulated by state and natural gas commissions, the practice has become increasingly controversial in certain parts of the country, resulting in increased scrutiny and regulation from federal agencies. For example the EPA has asserted that the SDWA applies to hydraulic fracturing involving diesel fuel and in February 2014 it issued final guidance on this subject. The guidance defines the term “diesel fuel”, describes the permitting requirements that apply under SDWA for the underground injection of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing and makes recommendations for permit writers. Although the guidance applies only in states where the EPA directly implements the Underground Injection Control Class II program, it could encourage state regulatory authorities to adopt permitting and other requirements for hydraulic fracturing. In April 2015, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule requiring federal pre-treatment standards for wastewater generated during the hydraulic fracturing process in shale and tight geologic formations (unconventional oil and gas resources). These rules were finalized in June 2016 and took effect in August 2016. Hydraulic fracturing requires the use of a significant volume of water with some resulting “flowback water” as well as “produced water.” The new pre-treatment rules require new and existing shale gas operations to pre-treat wastewater before transferring it to treatment facilities.

The EPA has conducted a nationwide study into the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water. The EPA issued its final report in December 2016 and concluded that several factors affect the frequency and severity of impacts to drinking water from fracking including water availability, injection of fracking fluids into groundwater resources or into failing wells, and discharge of inadequately treated waste water to surface water or unlined pits. The EPA has indicated that it desires to continue to study the matter. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of the Interior, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could result in further regulation of hydraulic fracturing.
 
From time to time, Congress has considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Many producing states have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.
 
Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows and could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform hydraulic fracturing 
 
We believe that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue toward stricter standards. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations in effect at the present time and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us, we cannot give any assurance that we will not be adversely affected in the future. We have established internal guidelines to be followed in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. Although we maintain pollution insurance against the costs of cleanup operations, public liability, and physical damage, there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, our workforce (including those employed by our subsidiary Nytis LLC) consisted of 55 employees, all of which are full-time employees. None of the members of our workforce are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe we have a good relationship with the members of our workforce.
Geographical Data
 
Carbon operates in one geographical area, the United States. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
Offices
 
Our executive offices are located at 1700 Broadway, Suite 1170, Denver, Colorado 80290. We maintain an office in Lexington, Kentucky from which we conduct our oil and gas operations.
Title to Properties
 
Title to our oil and gas properties is subject to royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working, and similar interests customary in the oil and gas industry. Under the terms of our bank credit facility, we have granted the lender a lien on a substantial majority of our properties. In addition, our properties may also be subject to liens incident to operating agreements, as well as other customary encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, and for current taxes not yet due. Our general practice is to conduct title examinations on material property acquisitions. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, a title examination and, if necessary, curative work is performed. The methods of title examination that we have adopted are reasonable in the opinion of management and are designed to ensure that production from our properties, if obtained, will be salable by us.
Glossary of Oil and Gas Terms
 
Many of the following terms are used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The definitions of proved developed reserves, proved reserves, and proved undeveloped reserves have been abbreviated from the applicable definitions contained in Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The entire definitions of those terms can be viewed on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.

Royalty | means an interest in an oil or natural gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage (or of the proceeds of the sale thereof), but generally does not require the owner to pay any portion of the costs of drilling or operating the wells on the leased acreage. Royalties may be either landowner’s royalties, which are reserved by the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is granted, or overriding royalties, which are usually reserved by an owner of the leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner. 
Standardized measure of present value of estimated future net revenues | means an estimate of the present value of the estimated future net revenues from proved oil or natural gas reserves at a date indicated after deducting estimated production and ad valorem taxes, future capital costs, operating expenses and income taxes computed by applying year end statutory tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already legislated. The estimated future net revenues are discounted at an annual rate of 10%, in accordance with the SEC’s practice, to determine their “present value.” The present value is shown to indicate the effect of time on the value of the revenue stream and should not be construed as being the fair market value of the properties. Estimates of future net revenues are made using oil and natural gas prices and operating costs at the estimation date and held constant for the life of the reserves.

Forward-looking statements are statements other than statements of historical or present facts, that address activities, events, outcomes, and other matters that Carbon plans, expects, intends, assumes, believes, budgets, predicts, forecasts, projects, estimates, or anticipates (and other similar expressions) will, should, or may occur in the future. Generally, the words "expects," "anticipates," "targets," "goals," "projects," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "may," "will," "could," "should," "future," "potential," "continue," variations of such words, and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions about future events and are based on currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events.
 These forward-looking statements appear in a number of places and include statements with respect to, among other things:

We believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, but we can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. We caution you that these forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions and are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration for and development, production, and sale of oil and natural gas. See "Competition" and "Regulation" above, as well as Part I, Item 1A—"Risk Factors," and Part II, Item 7—"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a description of various, but by no means all, factors that could materially affect our ability to achieve the anticipated results described in the forward-looking statements.
 
We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update this information to reflect events or circumstances after the filing of this report with the SEC, except as required by law. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and attributable to Carbon are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we may make or persons acting on our behalf may issue.
