ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Our Company
Manitowoc Foodservice, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2015 (the "Company," "MFS," "we," "our" or "us"), is one of the world's leading commercial foodservice equipment companies. We design, manufacture and supply best-in-class food and beverage equipment for the global commercial foodservice market, offering customers unparalleled operator and patron insights, collaborative kitchen solutions, culinary expertise and world-class implementation support and service. 
We intend to achieve sustainable growth globally and drive increased profitability by leveraging our position as a leading commercial foodservice equipment provider, while selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions and partnerships, growing our customer base, expanding the frontiers of foodservice innovation and continuing to attract and grow industry-leading talent. 
We are headquartered in New Port Richey, Florida, and operate 18 manufacturing facilities throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia. Our former parent, the Manitowoc Company, Inc ("MTW"), was founded in 1902 and began building commercial ice machines in 1966. Over time, we have become an industry-leading manufacturer of foodservice equipment. On February 6, 2017, we announced that we are rebranding the Company, our logo and our brand identity to Welbilt, Inc., effective March 6, 2017. The new name and brand represent a long-standing commitment to put customers’ needs first. This change is part of our strategic repositioning after we spun off from MTW on March 4, 2016.
Today, we sell through a global network of over 3,000 distributors and dealers in over 100 countries. The Company has approximately 5,500 employees and generated sales of $1.46 billion in 2016. Our portfolio of award-winning brands includes Cleveland™, Convotherm®, Delfield®, fitKitchenSM, Frymaster®, Garland®, Kolpak®, Lincoln™, Manitowoc® Ice, Merco®, Merrychef® and Multiplex®. All of our products are supported by KitchenCare®, our aftermarket parts and repair service business. 
Global Foodservice Market and Foodservice Equipment Industry 
The increasing demand for affordable dining is expected to continue on a global scale. Consumers in most markets are expected to gravitate towards more informal options, which is a trend seen among both high income consumers looking to save during a slow economic recovery, and lower income consumers looking for accessible entry points for "on the go" food consumption. For foodservice equipment operators in emerging markets, this offers enormous opportunity for innovation, particularly in terms of format, as new restaurant consumers look to experiment with a variety of brands and experiences. Quick-service restaurant ("QSR") chains, in particular, have proved successful at innovation in these markets.
Global and regional markets for food and foodservice are growing. The global foodservice industry was estimated at $2.6 trillion in 2016 according to Euromonitor, and is expected to increase at a compounded annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 5.9% to reach $3.3 trillion in 2020 as demonstrated in the graph below. Global expansion and long-term focus on new emerging markets with new equipment will be driven by chain restaurants in countries such as India, China, parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia in general. Increased government spending on infrastructure and investments in tourism will support this change.

The main drivers for steady growth on a global basis are:

• | Population and income growth, especially in emerging markets and less developed regions: Global population is expected to reach 9.7 billion people by 2050 and more than 11 billion people by 2100 according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Africa is expected to account for more than half of the world’s population growth, followed by India, Pakistan, Indonesia and the United States ("U.S."). Additionally, more hectic lifestyles with an eating culture changing to "on the go" and increasing demand for high-quality food prepared away from home in casual restaurants based on increasing disposable incomes is expected to lead to more and new offerings. Similar to the last five decades, the real (inflation-adjusted) growth rate in the U.S. is expected to be stable at about 2% on average according to the 2016 Restaurant Industry Forecast by the National Restaurant Association.


• | New dining / restaurant concepts and new markets for chain restaurants are increasing: Demand in the restaurant segment, one of our largest end markets, is driven by consumer disposable income, employment, investment in new establishments, and the underlying trend and demand for increased convenience. In large emerging markets with an increasing middle-class like China, Argentina, Brazil and Nigeria, tremendous opportunity exists to broaden the range of new restaurant concepts and chains.


• | Health and safety issues: Food safety and sanitation are a top priority first and foremost for end-consumers. Proper food handling, environmental sustainability and social responsibility, reduction of energy use as well as less waste from unused food and premature food spoilage have become more and more important. These issues are key drivers for the replacement and upgrade of existing equipment with our customers.

We believe that the size of the global foodservice equipment markets, including the hot side, cold side, beverage and aftermarket parts and services equates to approximately 1% of the foodservice market global revenue. The foodservice equipment market was valued at $27.7 billion in 2015 according to Future Market Insights. It is expected to expand at a CAGR of 5.1% from 2016-2024 and is expected to reach $42.9 billion by 2024. We believe the main growth will be in the hot side product categories of cooking and hold and serve with an expected CAGR for the 2016-2019 period of 4% to 5%, whereas the CAGR on the cold side and the aftermarket sales is expected to be around 3% to 4%. 
The U.S. foodservice market accounted for approximately 20.6%, or $543.1 billion, of the global food service market in 2016 based on Euromonitor studies. The market size is influenced by disposable income, increased employment, investment in new establishments and the underlying trend for increased convenience. According to Technomic, the foodservice industry in the U.S. is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 2% during the 2017-2022 period with some foodservice industry sectors, such as senior living or fast casual dining growing at a CAGR of 4-6% during the same time period. Sales for the U.S. and Canadian foodservice equipment and supplies market in 2015 was $11.4 billion, an increase of 27.3% compared to 2011 market sales according to a 2016 study performed by the North American Association of Foodservice Equipment Manufacturers ("NAFEM"). 
The Latin American foodservice industry is expected to show 6% year over year growth from 2016-2020. This is mainly driven by the growth in the categories of cafes/bars and home delivery according to Euromonitor International. Last year, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Mexico demonstrated the highest productivity among all Latin American economies, which is based on gross domestic income per hour worked, while other countries like Brazil, Colombia or Venezuela have the potential for significant future development.
Industrialization is a huge factor for the growth of the middle class in Asia Pacific ("APAC"), with the consequence of more disposable income for consumption. Foodservice sales are projected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 7.3% or $407.5 billion during the 2016-2020 period based on Euromonitor data. Higher demand for new hotels and resorts and population growth in India and other Asian markets is expected to contribute to the overall market demand for new foodservice products.
The foodservice industry market in Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") in 2016 was approximately $578.8 billion and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.8% during the 2016-2020 period according to Euromonitor. Growth in the largest and established EMEA countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and France will mainly be in replacement equipment and aftermarket parts. In Western Europe, consumers have become much more value-conscious, and increasingly look to modern chains and fine-dining concepts as the best way to spend their free time for food. On the other hand, emerging markets show a greater percentage of new equipment purchases in the Middle East (especially the Emirates), Eastern Europe and some African countries. Chain foodservice and QSR sales are up by 4% to 5% year over year in these emerging markets and are expected to grow at 5% in the coming years.

Product Innovation: Our Holistic Approach
We have a staff of in-house engineers and technicians on three continents, supplemented with external engineering resources, who collectively are responsible for improving existing products and developing new products. Our team of engineers focus on developing cost effective, innovative, high-performance, low-maintenance products that are intended to solve problems for our customers in differentiated ways and create brand loyalty among customers. They work closely with our culinary, manufacturing and marketing staff enabling us to identify changing end-user requirements, implement new technologies and effectively pursue product innovations. 
MFS strives to deliver products and solutions that enable our customers to provide fresh, new food experiences to consumers outside the home globally. Consumer demands are constantly changing, and a more health-conscious public is looking for fresh, natural alternatives to traditional out-of-home eating options. They increasingly care about how food is sourced, handled and prepared. MFS is focused on providing our customers with the equipment they need to build on the opportunities from these dynamic changes in the foodservice market.
Through innovation, we strive to simplify and improve the speed and flexibility of restaurant operations, improve the quality of the food, improve health and sanitation, and reduce the overall energy consumption and life cycle operating costs of the equipment. We believe that these benefits can also be enhanced by mobile connectivity and monitoring:

• | Mobile Connectivity and Monitoring: Integration of mobile devices in kitchens is increasing rapidly, and will extend the user interface beyond the traditional boundaries of the equipment. The combination of wearables and beacons can provide notification of key tasks and equipment situations requiring immediate attention even if the foodservice preparation crew is not looking at the appliance. Bluetooth allows for secure information exchange using cellular or network mobile devices to collect information on the equipment, view training or maintenance instructions, and update menus and equipment software. RFID tracking of food and holding trays helps ensure the right food in the right quantities is available when needed. Our KitchenConnect™ enabled products also include a system for equipment monitoring which collects data to reduce downtime, optimize energy use, and improve service response time.

-14-


• | Productivity, Speed and Flexibility: Kitchens that occupy less space, have higher output and are easier to operate are key to growth in the foodservice industry, particularly in urban locations. Greater speed and equipment flexibility also allow for higher productivity and a wider range of menu options. We are also expanding the use of impingement microwave ovens by adding steam and inverter control to the magnetron, which enables better control over moisture levels in the food and the microwave heating rate, and makes the oven much easier to clean with steam. Innovative control systems can improve information flow in the kitchen by letting operators know what and when to cook, and how to maintain and clean the equipment.


• | Energy Efficiency: We are focused on increasing the efficiency of individual components and reducing standby energy losses. An example of reducing standby energy loss is the use of induction heating for holding pans so that energy is only used when a thermal load is present. We are also leading in the area of high efficiency combustion systems with metal matrix burner technology. This technology reduces gas consumption and allows for variable firing rate. For cooling, natural refrigerants such as propane-based R-290 offer improved thermodynamic performance, and variable speed compressors and fans further increase overall cycle performance under partial load conditions.


• | Health and Sanitation: Manual sanitation of equipment in the restaurant has become a major challenge due to extended operating hours, the increasing pieces and complexity of equipment in kitchens, and competing demands from revenue producing tasks. For the cold product category, our HEPA filtration technology brings the cleanroom into the kitchen, controlling airborne contamination of ice machines. Electrically charged particles of water and UV light provide the basis for automated sterilization of food zones and contact surfaces in equipment. Compact steam generators are also being embedded in some of our equipment, providing a proven technology for cleaning cooking cavities in our ovens.

Our fitKitchenSM initiative strives to develop kitchen solutions that cover our entire product portfolio, including both existing products and the portfolio in the R&D stage. The primary objective of fitKitchenSM is to allow MFS to engage with current and potential customers in new, meaningful and more strategic ways. fitKitchenSM specializes in "right-sizing" operations, improving efficiencies and reducing a restaurant's equipment footprint. 
Our fitKitchenSM employees have operational backgrounds that include experience at casual dining, family dining, QSR chains, and independent restaurants. We provide culinary support for customers in expanding their menus and integrating new technology into their operations, as well as engineering support for the development of solutions, prototypes and testing of new technologies. MFS has a strong track record of working with customers to develop equipment platforms from scratch, taking into account freshness, flavor and speed of service, as well as constraints of building infrastructure, kitchen ventilation and HVAC systems. 
In 2016, we introduced 16 new products, 10 hot-side products and 6 cold-side and beverage products. In addition, we released 7 significant upgrades to our existing product platforms. Some of these new products include:

In the Americas, MFS has a broad portfolio of channel partners, covering all major foodservice market segments, including QSR's, fast casual restaurants, education, health care, business and industry, as well as the convenience and retail space. Our direct sales team is supplemented by a network of industry-leading rep groups, providing national coverage. Direct sales team, sales reps and distributors jointly serve over 900 equipment dealers with our full portfolio of hot and cold product category brands. A dedicated strategic account team with culinary support is focused on the major U.S.-based restaurant chains, where we have significant global market share. Our teams work closely with our customers’ menu and equipment development teams to assure alignment with their strategic plans. We also have distribution hubs in Canada, Mexico and Latin America. Our KitchenCare® business provides a range of after-market parts and services that manages a comprehensive factory-authorized service network, assuring proper installation, preventative maintenance, spare parts supply and maximum customer uptime on all MFS appliances.

US Channel Partners typically referred to as "General Market"

In EMEA, our distribution includes hubs in Herborn, Germany serving countries in central and eastern Europe, in Guildford, England serving countries in the United Kingdom and northern Europe, and in Barcelona, Spain serving countries in southern and western Europe. Each of these distribution centers operates a network of third party dealers chosen to satisfy the requirements of both chain customers and independent caterers in their respective territories. Outside these countries, MFS products and services are sold through non-exclusive third party distributors and service companies. In addition, our beverage customers receive specialist support from our beverage systems manufacturing facility in Halesowen, England.
In APAC, MFS has had a presence since the mid-1980s. As our chain customers expanded into the region, we first established distribution and service support, followed by building a sales force and our first manufacturing facility in China in 1992. Today, we operate four manufacturing facilities and five sales and service offices throughout the region. We access the market in APAC through our dedicated distribution and dealer channel partners, most of whom have been established in the market for decades and have been MFS partners for over 15 years. Our business in the region is expanding into a local customer base that is focused on western style menus and desires the appliances that will consistently deliver the quality expected from our top brands with the reliability and support for which we are known.

Financial Information About Business Segments
Our products are sold in more than 100 countries. We report our operating results through three reportable segments: Americas, EMEA and APAC. All three reportable segments offer a broad range of hot and cold category foodservice products and solutions for customers in various end markets. 
Our broad portfolio of foodservice equipment and services provides us with a balanced, diverse revenue base across geographies and foodservice product categories. Approximately 40-45% of our revenues are for cold category products, 35-40% are for hot category products and approximately 15-20% for aftermarket parts and services. Net sales by product class for the last three fiscal years is disclosed in Note 22, "Business Segments," to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, MFS generated revenue of $1,456.6 million and earnings from operations of $199.2 million. Based on sales by destination in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the majority of our revenue was derived from customers in the Americas at approximately 72%, with 17% from EMEA customers and 11% from APAC customers. 
The following table presents the relative percentages of net sales attributable to each reportable segment for each of the last three fiscal years. The total measure of profit and loss for each of the last three fiscal years as well as the total assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 attributable to each reportable segment are included in Note 22, "Business Segments" to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Seasonality
Typically, the first quarter of our fiscal year represents the least favorable period for our financial results. Our customers are primarily in the northern hemisphere, and the warmer summer weather generally leads to an increase in construction and remodeling within the foodservice industry, as well as in the use and replacement of ice machines. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 5,500 employees across all of our locations. In North America, we have in place seven labor agreements with five employee unions. We have one trade union in Europe and one trade union in China.
Raw Materials
We support our region-of-use production strategy with corresponding region-of-use supplier partners. The primary raw materials that we use are structural and rolled steel, aluminum, and copper. We also purchase electrical equipment and other semi- and fully-processed materials. We maintain inventories of steel and other purchased material. We have been successful in our goal to maintain alternative sources of raw materials and supplies, and therefore are not dependent on a single source for any particular raw material or supply.
