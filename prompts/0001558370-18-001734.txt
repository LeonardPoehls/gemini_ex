     Item 1.  Business
     Overview
     QCP is a publicly-traded Maryland corporation (NYSE: QCP) primarily engaged in the ownership and leasing of post‑acute/skilled nursing properties and memory care/assisted living properties. We were formed in 2016 to hold the HCR ManorCare, Inc. (“HCRMC”) portfolio (“HCRMC Properties”), 28 other healthcare related properties (“non‑HCRMC Properties,” and, collectively with the HCRMC Properties, the “Properties”), a deferred rent obligation (“DRO”) due from HCRMC under a master lease (the “Tranche B DRO”) and an equity method investment in HCRMC (together, the “QCP Business”) previously held by HCP, Inc. (“HCP”). Prior to the separation from HCP, which was completed on October 31, 2016, QCP was a wholly owned subsidiary of HCP. In connection with the separation, HCP transferred to certain subsidiaries of QCP the equity of entities that hold the QCP Business. Pursuant to the separation agreement, dated as of October 31, 2016, by and between HCP and QCP, HCP effected the separation by means of a pro rata distribution of substantially all of the outstanding shares of QCP common stock to HCP stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 24, 2016, the record date (the “Spin‑Off”). Upon completion of the HCRMC Transactions, the Tranche B DRO will be eliminated and any accrued but unpaid rent under the Master Lease released pursuant to the Master Lease Amendment (as defined below). See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Deferred Rent Obligation” for additional information regarding the Tranche B DRO.
     Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” and “the Company” refer to QCP on a consolidated basis after giving effect to the transfer of assets and liabilities from HCP as well as to the QCP Business prior to the date of the completion of the separation. QCP elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with its initial taxable year ended December 31, 2016. REITs are generally not liable for federal corporate income taxes as long as they continue to distribute not less than 100% of their REIT taxable income. We expect to terminate our REIT status in connection with the HCRMC Transactions.
     As of December 31, 2017, the Properties consisted of 257 post‑acute/skilled nursing properties, 61 memory care/assisted living properties, one surgical hospital and one medical office building, including 74 non-core properties actively being marketed for sale. The Properties are primarily located in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Florida and Michigan. As of December 31, 2017, 292 of the 320 properties were leased to HCRMC under a master lease agreement (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the “Master Lease”). The Master Lease properties are leased to HCRMC’s wholly owned subsidiary, HCR III Healthcare, LLC (“HCR III” or the “Lessee”). All of HCR III’s obligations under the Master Lease are guaranteed by HCRMC. The non‑HCRMC Properties are leased on a triple-net basis to other national and regional operators and other tenants unaffiliated with HCRMC. Our primary source of revenue is rent payable under the Master Lease.

 The Master Lease is structured as a triple‑net lease, in which HCRMC, either directly or through its affiliates and sublessees, operates the properties and is responsible for all operating costs associated with the properties, including the payment of property taxes, insurance and repairs, and providing indemnities to us against liabilities associated with the operation of the properties.
     Before the Spin-Off, QCP had not conducted any business as a separate company and had no material assets or liabilities. The operations of the business transferred to us by HCP on the Spin-Off date are presented as if the transferred business was our business for all historical periods described and at the carrying value of such assets and liabilities reflected in HCP’s books and records. Additionally, the financial statements reflect the shares of common stock outstanding at the separation date as outstanding for all periods prior to the separation.
     Following the Spin-Off, we initially lacked certain non‑management administrative capabilities, and accordingly, we entered into an agreement pursuant to which HCP would provide certain administrative and support services to us on a transitional basis (the “Transition Services Agreement”). As of October 31, 2017, we completed the transition of these services to QCP’s operating platform, and the Transition Services Agreement expired in accordance with its terms.
     Employees
     At December 31, 2017, we had 10 employees (including our executive officers), none of whom was subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
     Headquarters
     Our corporate headquarters is located at 7315 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 550 East, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, and our telephone number is (240) 223-4680.
     Going Concern Assessment
     The combined consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report have been presented on the basis that the Company would continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. In its annual going concern assessment, management identified certain conditions which raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern prior to consideration of management’s plans to mitigate the conditions identified and alleviate the substantial doubt. A “going concern” or like qualification or exception in the independent auditors’ opinion within their report accompanying the combined consolidated financial statements would constitute an event of default under our senior secured credit facilities.
     HCRMC, the ultimate parent company of our principal tenant, continues to be adversely impacted by underperformance, and a challenging operating environment in the post-acute/skilled nursing sector. The impact of the downward, and expected continued, pressure on revenues and operating income has resulted in HCRMC’s default under the Master Lease and materially lower rent payments to the Company. This continued performance decline has reduced, and will likely continue to reduce, the Company’s coverage under its debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”), a covenant in its senior secured credit facilities. We believe it is likely that our DSCR will fall below the minimum 1.75 coverage in 2018, which would constitute a covenant violation and event of default under such credit facilities, absent proactive action by management.
     In order to address the risk of covenant violation, management plans to implement the following actions:
    
· | We are in the process of selling 74 non-core skilled nursing/senior housing facilities. The proceeds of any such sales will be used to reduce debt and improve our DSCR covenant compliance. We expect to close on the sales of some or all of these assets before the end of 2018.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We expect to use a portion of our cash on hand ($325.6 million as of December 31, 2017) to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness in order to maintain compliance with our DSCR covenant.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     
 
  7

 


· | We expect to maintain sufficient liquidity levels to enable us to honor our current obligations over the next 12 months.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Further, in connection with the completion of the HCRMC Transactions, we expect to consolidate some or all of the operations and assets and liabilities of HCRMC, including the Centerbridge Facility, which is scheduled to mature on January 17, 2019. We believe, based on the performance and relatively low leverage of the collateral (the hospice business), it is probable that we will be able to extend the maturity or refinance this obligation prior to maturity.
     We believe it is probable that management’s plans will be effectively implemented during 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. Moreover, we believe it is probable that management’s plans, when implemented, will mitigate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  
     The HCRMC Transactions and the HCRMC Bankruptcy
     On March 2, 2018, we entered into a plan sponsor agreement (the “Plan Sponsor Agreement”) with HCRMC, HCP Mezzanine Lender, LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of QCP (“Purchaser”), and certain lessor subsidiaries of QCP. The Plan Sponsor Agreement contemplates that, among other things, pursuant to a prepackaged plan of reorganization of HCRMC (the “Prepackaged Plan”) under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), Purchaser will acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of HCRMC, in exchange for the discharge under the Prepackaged Plan of all claims of QCP against HCRMC and its subsidiaries arising under HCRMC’s guaranty of the Master Lease.
     On March 4, 2018, as required by the Plan Sponsor Agreement, HCRMC filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “HCRMC Bankruptcy”). Under the terms of the Plan Sponsor Agreement and as contemplated in the Prepackaged Plan, all creditors of HCRMC other than QCP will be unimpaired.
     Completion of the transactions contemplated by the Plan Sponsor Agreement (the “HCRMC Transactions”), remains subject to certain conditions, including state licensing and bankruptcy court approval, and may be terminated under certain circumstances. Bankruptcy court approval is expected in the second quarter and the HCRMC Transactions are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2018. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the HCRMC Transactions and the HCRMC Bankruptcy” and Note 14. “Subsequent Events” to the combined consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report for a more detailed description.
     Upon completion of the HCRMC Transactions, QCP will enter into an amendment to the Master Lease (the “Master Lease Amendment”). The Master Lease Amendment will provide that, among other things, until the seventh anniversary of the closing date, HCR III will be permitted to defer paying any portion of the monthly minimum rent due to QCP to the extent that HCR III does not have cash and cash equivalents available to make such payment in a calendar month after HCR III retains amounts reasonably required, taking into account projected receipts, to satisfy HCR III’s monthly cash needs and liabilities reasonably anticipated to be paid in cash within 90 days of the first business day of such calendar month. This new deferred rent obligation will be due and payable upon the earlier of the seventh anniversary of the effective date of the Prepackaged Plan or the occurrence of certain other specified events. Upon completion of the HCRMC Transactions, the Tranche B DRO will be eliminated and any accrued but unpaid rent under the Master Lease released pursuant to the Master Lease Amendment. Within seven days of completion, HCRMC’s guaranty of the Master Lease will be terminated, released and discharged.
     Concurrently with the execution of the Plan Sponsor Agreement, HCRMC, Carlyle MC Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, Carlyle Partners V-A MC, L.P., a Delaware limited Partnership, Carlyle Partners V MC, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, CP V Coinvestment A, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, CP V Coinvestment B, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and MC Operations Investments, LLC, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of QCP (collectively, the “Restructuring Support Parties”), entered into a restructuring support agreement (the “Restructuring Support Agreement”), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions therein, the Restructuring Support Parties, as owners of common stock of HCRMC, covenanted to, among other things, support the HCRMC Transactions and the Prepackaged Plan, and not to take any action, directly or indirectly, that could interfere with the confirmation of the Prepackaged Plan or the consummation of the HCRMC Transactions. In addition, the Restructuring Support Parties agreed not to transfer, sell or pledge their HCRMC common stock or the right to vote unless the transferee of those shares joins the Restructuring Support Agreement. All obligations pursuant to the Restructuring

Support Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of the effective date of the Prepackaged Plan or termination of the Plan Sponsor Agreement.
    
Strategy
     QCP intends to maximize stockholder value through:
    
· | Completing the HCRMC Transactions. Until completion of the HCRMC Transactions, our level of control over HCRMC is limited. At completion, a new senior management team will be installed. We believe the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of HCRMC will enhance HCRMC’s financial prospects. Through the HCRMC Transactions, we will own HCRMC’s business, meaningfully diversifying our Company, and entering the important (though challenging) health care sector of providing skilled nursing, hospice and other ancillary services. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Terminating our REIT status. In connection with the HCRMC Transactions, we expect to terminate our REIT status and instead be taxed as a C corporation. Terminating REIT status will enable clear and unrestricted ownership of both our real estate and the other valuable components of HCRMC, including retaining certain positive tax attributes. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Restructuring HCRMC post acquisition. In connection with the HCRMC Transactions, we intend to commence a full analysis of the HCRMC business, which will position us to evaluate strategies of improving and/or restructuring, and maximizing the efficiency and value of, HCRMC’s business. HCRMC provides vital services to patients and residents. Any strategies implemented will not degrade HCRMC’s ability to provide care. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sale, remarketing or re-leasing non-core properties. We have currently identified 74 skilled nursing/senior housing facilities as non-core to our business and have actively marketed these properties. Initial non-binding bids (subject to additional due diligence) indicate that the potential proceeds from the sale of the non-core properties will be in excess of the net book value of these properties as of December 31, 2017. The non-core properties generated negative EBITDAR of approximately $2.7 million in 2017. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Engaging in proactive asset management of our core properties, including the evaluation of re-leasing opportunities. Our core portfolio is expected to consist of 160 skilled nursing facilities and 58 assisted living facilities located in 18 states. We intend to proactively manage our core properties in order to maximize their value, including the evaluation of potential opportunities to re-release, sell or joint venture the core properties to other operators at market rates. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reducing or refinancing our debt. We intend to focus on enhancing our balance sheet by using cash on hand, excess cash flow from operations and proceeds from selective property sales, if available, to reduce our outstanding indebtedness, subject to the terms of our existing debt agreements, and to seek to refinance our debt on more favorable terms. We will continue to work with our lenders to seek to maintain compliance with our various debt covenants. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintaining the ongoing operations of the hospice and home health business post acquisition. Our objective is to maintain the ongoing operations of HCRMC’s hospice and home health business, which has yielded positive operating results for HCRMC during recent years with operating income of $106.9 million, $114.5 million and $130.5 million for 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, as reported by HCRMC. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fostering a supportive culture. We intend to foster a culture that supports the interests of all stakeholders, including patients, residents, employees and stockholders.

      HCRMC Overview
     HCRMC, collectively with its subsidiaries, is a leading national healthcare services provider, with over 50,000 employees, that owns and operates skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers, assisted living facilities, memory care facilities, hospice and home health agencies, and outpatient rehabilitation clinics. As of December 31, 2017, its long‑term care business operated in 296 centers in 25 states, with 67% of the centers located in Pennsylvania, Ohio,

Michigan, Florida and Illinois. As of December 31, 2017, HCRMC offered hospice and home health services through 109 offices located in 23 states, and offered rehabilitation therapy services in 52 outpatient therapy clinics and a variety of other settings, including skilled nursing centers, schools and hospitals. HCRMC has invested over $380 million in capital expenditures during the five-year period ended December 31, 2017.
     For the year ended December 31, 2017, HCRMC generated $3.7 billion in total revenues consisting of 83% from long‑term care, including its post‑acute/skilled nursing and memory care/assisted living businesses, and 17% from hospice, home health and rehabilitation services.
     HCRMC’s two primary business segments, as of December 31, 2017, were as follows:
     Long‑Term Care
     HCRMC’s long‑term care segment includes the operation of post‑acute/skilled nursing centers, memory care facilities and assisted living facilities. HCRMC focuses on providing high‑quality post‑acute and long-term care to patients. Post‑acute care patients often require intensive rehabilitation therapy in order to maximize their recoveries. Services rendered to them are typically reimbursed by Medicare, managed care or other private insurance, which generally provide higher reimbursement rates than Medicaid.
     As of December 31, 2017, the 232 HCRMC post‑acute/skilled nursing properties owned by QCP were located across 24 states, and approximately 66% of the properties were located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Florida and Illinois. HCRMC operates its post‑acute/skilled nursing businesses under the Heartland Health Care Center® and ManorCare Health Services® brands.
     HCRMC primarily operates its memory care/assisted living properties as stand‑alone properties, as well as separate units within some of the post‑acute/skilled nursing properties. These business lines provide residents with personal care services and assistance with activities of daily living as well as dementia care, if applicable.
     As of December 31, 2017, the 60 HCRMC memory care/assisted living properties owned by QCP were located across 12 states. Approximately 85% of these properties were stand‑alone memory care/assisted living properties, operated under the Arden Courts® brand, providing care focused on residents who are suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. The remaining facilities provide assisted and independent living services.
     Hospice and Home Health
     As of December 31, 2017, HCRMC provided hospice and home health services in 109 offices in 23 states, covering many of the markets served by HCRMC’s post‑acute/skilled nursing properties. From 2013 to 2017, the revenues and operating margin from this segment have grown, on a compound annual basis, by 3.9% and 2.0%, respectively.
     For a description of risks relating to HCRMC, including those related to long‑term care and hospice and home health, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business” and “—Impact of Industry Trends on HCRMC and Recent Events Specific to HCRMC” below.
     Impact of Industry Trends on HCRMC and Recent Events Specific to HCRMC
     HCRMC, along with other post‑acute/skilled nursing operators, has been and continues to be adversely impacted by a challenging operating environment in the post‑acute/skilled nursing sector, which has put downward pressure on revenues and operating income. Ongoing trends in the post‑acute/skilled nursing sector include, but are not limited to, the following:
    
· | A shift away from a traditional fee‑for‑service model towards new managed care models, which base reimbursement on patient outcome measures;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     
 
  10

 


· | Increased penetration of Medicare Advantage plans (i.e., managed Medicare), which has reduced reimbursement rates, average length of stay and average daily census, particularly for higher acuity patients;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increased competition from alternative healthcare services such as home health agencies, life care at home, community‑based service programs, senior housing, retirement communities and convalescent centers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increased regulatory scrutiny on government reimbursements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | Wage pressure above reimbursement rate growth.
--+-----------------------------------------------

      In addition to the industry trends, HCRMC’s recent performance has been impacted by the following:
    
· | Certain costs and expenses related to HCRMC’s restructuring initiatives; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In April 2015, the DOJ filed a civil complaint against HCRMC for alleged false claims related to Medicare reimbursement. On November 27, 2017, the Court granted the United States’ motion to dismiss the case with prejudice. HCRMC incurred associated legal and regulatory defense costs, which in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $15 million, $11 million and $9 million, respectively.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Due to the headwinds facing the broader post‑acute/skilled nursing industry and HCRMC, including the continued reduction in revenues per admission and shorter length of patient stays, HCRMC’s performance continued to deteriorate in 2017. As a result, despite revised Master Lease obligations from lease amendments and reductions of contractual rent in the past three years and non‑strategic property sales, HCRMC’s normalized fixed charge coverage stood at 0.73x for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 1.01x for the year ended December 31, 2016. HCRMC’s facility EBITDAR (defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and rent) cash flow coverage ratio was 0.61x for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 0.84x for the year ended December 31, 2016. For additional information regarding the foregoing HCRMC data and their computations, as well as HCRMC’s exit from the 50 non-strategic properties, the Master Lease amendments in the past three years and HCRMC’s recent performance, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—HCRMC Financial Information” and “—Portfolio Overview.” For a more detailed description of risks to which we are subject due to our dependence on HCRMC, including adverse business and financial conditions and developments, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business.”
     While we expect the post‑acute/skilled nursing operating environment to remain challenging in the near‑term, we believe that healthcare service providers, such as HCRMC, and healthcare real estate owners, such as us, that are able to successfully navigate through the current challenges will benefit from the long‑term positive fundamentals of the post‑acute/skilled nursing sector, including: (i) an aging population, (ii) expected increases in aggregate skilled nursing expenditures and (iii) supply constraints in the skilled nursing sector due to certificate of need requirements and other barriers to entry. HCRMC also benefits from operating in the memory care/assisted living and hospice and home health sectors, which we believe have favorable near‑ and long‑term fundamentals, due in part to growing demand for Alzheimer’s and other dementia care services. See “—Post‑Acute/Skilled Nursing Industry Overview” and “—Memory Care/Assisted Living Industry Overview” for a discussion of healthcare trends in the post‑acute/skilled nursing and memory care/assisted living sectors.
     Competition
     Investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive. We face competition from other REITs, investment companies, pension funds, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders, developers and other institutional investors, some of whom may have greater flexibility (e.g., non‑REIT competitors), resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives. Our ability to compete may also be impacted by global, national and local economic trends, availability of investment alternatives, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, existing laws and regulations, new legislation, population trends and our expected loss of REIT status in connection with the HCRMC Transactions, among other factors.
    
 
  11

 

 Rental and related revenues are dependent on the ability of HCRMC and our other existing and future tenants and operators to compete with other companies on a number of different levels, including: the quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a property, price and range of services offered, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, location, the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas, and the financial condition of our tenants and operators. Private, federal and state payment programs, and government reimbursement, as well as the effect of laws and regulations, may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators. For a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business.”
     Insurance
     HCRMC and the lessees under the leases for the non‑HCRMC Properties are required to provide various types of insurance, including, but not limited to, liability and property, including business interruption, coverage. Additionally, our properties are covered under a corporate general liability insurance program. We have the right under the Master Lease and the leases for the non‑HCRMC Properties to regularly review our lessees’ insurance coverages, and we intend to do so. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts of war or other events, that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. In addition, we have a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake, hurricane, flood and windstorm occurrences for which the related insurances carry higher deductibles.
     We believe that the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our lessees and operators are customary for similarly situated companies in our industry. We cannot, however, provide assurance that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the insurance coverage provided will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we provide assurance with regard to the future financial viability of the insurers.
     Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement
     Overview
     HCRMC and our other existing tenants and operators are, and our future tenants and operators will be, typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to quality of care, licensure and certificate of need, government reimbursement, fraud and abuse practices, and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities, and we expect that the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, healthcare management and provision of services, among others. These regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. Affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies, and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Changes in laws, regulations, reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non‑compliance by our tenants and operators could have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business.”
     The following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our tenants and operators (including HCRMC), and in certain cases, to us:
     Fraud and Abuse Enforcement
     There are various extremely complex U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers’ relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers. These laws include: (i) U.S. federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other U.S. federal or state healthcare programs; (ii) U.S. federal and state anti‑kickback and fee‑splitting statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid anti‑kickback statute, which prohibit or restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services; (iii) U.S. federal and state physician self‑referral laws (commonly referred to as the “Stark Law”), which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or 

 
  12

 
an immediate family member has a financial relationship; (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services; and (v) U.S. federal and state privacy laws, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (commonly referred to as “HIPAA”), which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information. Violations of U.S. healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, including punitive sanctions, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs. These laws are enforced by a variety of federal, state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions.
     Reimbursement
     Sources of revenues for HCRMC and our other existing tenants and operators include, and for our future tenants and operators may include, among others, governmental healthcare programs, such as the federal Medicare programs and state Medicaid programs, and non‑governmental third‑party payors, such as insurance carriers and health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”). As federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives, and as the federal government and many states face significant current and future budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators. Additionally, new and evolving payor and provider programs in the United States, including but not limited to Medicare Advantage, Dual Eligible, Accountable Care Organizations, and Bundled Payments could adversely impact our tenants’ and operators’ liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.     Healthcare Licensure and Certificate of Need
     Certain healthcare properties in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws and regulations. In addition, various licenses and permits are required to handle controlled substances (including narcotics), operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate equipment. Many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need, which requires prior approval for the construction or expansion of certain healthcare properties. The approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants’ and operators’ abilities to expand or change their businesses.
     Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”)
     Our properties must comply with the ADA, and any similar state or local laws, to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined in those statutes. The ADA may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. To date, we have not received any notices of non-compliance with the ADA that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ADA concerns. Should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be determined to exist at any of our properties, we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make properties ADA‑compliant. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ADA is an ongoing one, and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect.
     Environmental Matters
     A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare property operations. These complex federal and state statutes, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender. Some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property, such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and any related liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property.
