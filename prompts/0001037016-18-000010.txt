Nextel Brazil Business Overview
We provide wireless communication services under the NextelTM brand in Brazil with our principal operations located in major urban and suburban centers with high population densities and related transportation corridors of that country where there is a concentration of Brazil’s population and economic activity, including primarily Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Nextel Brazil operates a wideband code division multiple access, or WCDMA, network, which has been upgraded to offer long-term evolution, or LTE, services in certain areas. Nextel Brazil's network enables us to offer a wide range of products and services supported by that technology. We are also a party to a roaming agreement that allows us to offer our subscribers nationwide voice and data services outside of our network's footprint. Our target market is individual consumers who use our services to meet both professional and personal needs. Our target subscribers generally exhibit above average usage, revenue and loyalty characteristics. We believe our target market is attracted to the services and pricing plans we offer, as well as the quality of and data speeds provided by our network. 
The services we currently offer include:

• | mobile telephone voice and wireless data services;


• | international voice and data roaming services;


• | application-based radio connection; and


• | value-added services, including sports, music and entertainment streaming capabilities; online education; and access to national and international WiFi hotspot networks.

In September 2017, Nextel Brazil decided to wind down its integrated digital enhanced network, or iDEN, operations with a target to cease all iDEN services in mid-2018. As a result, Nextel Brazil has provided notice of the eventual shutdown to its remaining iDEN subscribers and is currently working to actively migrate the remainder of its legacy iDEN subscriber base to its WCDMA network by proactively promoting attractive service offerings. As of December 31, 2017, 11% of our subscribers were on Nextel Brazil's iDEN network.
The majority of our subscribers purchase services from us by acquiring the subscriber identity module, or SIM, cards from us separately, and using the SIM cards in handsets that they acquire from other sources. As of December 31, 2017, Nextel Brazil had 3.246 million total subscriber units in commercial service, which we estimate to be about 4.2% of total postpaid mobile handsets and other devices in commercial service in Brazil. We refer to these subscriber units in commercial service collectively as our subscriber base.

Operating Strategy 
Our goal is to grow our subscriber base and revenues by providing differentiated wireless communications services that are valued by our existing and potential subscribers. We are also striving to manage our capital and operating expenditures in the near term and improve our profitability and cash flow over the long term. Our strategy for achieving these goals is based on several core principles, including:

• | offering a unique and superior customer-centric experience, including a reliable and high quality wireless network and rate plan flexibility;


• | continuing to implement cost reduction strategies and redesigning our network architecture in order to lower cash costs per user, outweigh scale disadvantages, create an agile organization and improve overall profitability;


• | focusing on higher value customer segments that generate higher average revenue per user, or ARPU, and lower subscriber turnover; and


• | building on the strength of the unique positioning of the Nextel brand.

During 2017, our results of operations were pressured by subscriber losses on our legacy iDEN network, which does not support the high speed data applications sought by many of our current and potential subscribers. Our consolidated operating revenues declined by 12% from 2016 to 2017 due to an 11% decrease in our consolidated subscriber base during 2017, almost all of which was driven by a 58% decrease in our iDEN subscriber base. As a result, our iDEN-based operating revenues decreased from $278.2 million in 2016 to $148.7 million in 2017. While we were able to reduce our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses by 3% in 2017 to offset a portion of the decline, we generated an operating loss for the period, partially as a result of $179.7 million in impairment, restructuring and other charges we recognized in 2017. As a result of Nextel Brazil's decision to wind down its iDEN network, we expect a significant decrease in iDEN-based operating revenues from 2017 to 2018, which will have a negative impact on operating income in 2018. 
In addition, as a result of pressure on our capital resources, over the last several years, we have implemented changes in our business to better align our organization and costs with our operational and financial results. These changes have included reduced spending on subscriber growth, reductions in capital expenditures, significant reductions in our headquarters staff through the reorganization of certain roles and responsibilities between our Brazil and corporate teams, and headcount reductions in Brazil, all of which were designed to reduce costs while maintaining the support necessary to meet our subscribers' needs. Additionally, during 2017, we reached agreement with our bank lenders to obtain amortization and covenant relief. 
Effective in January 2018, we entered into amendments to Nextel Brazil's equipment financing facility and its bank loans with Brazilian lenders, which aligned the material financing terms in all three facilities. Among other changes, these amendments provide for the deferral of substantially all principal payments for the first 48 months from the date of effectiveness, an extension of the loan maturity dates to 98 months from the date of effectiveness, and a holiday for certain financial covenant compliance, including the net debt financial covenant, until June 30, 2020. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on these financing arrangements. 
Partnership Agreement
On June 5, 2017, we and AINMT Holdings AB, or ice group, an international telecommunications company operating primarily in Norway under the “ice.net” brand, along with certain affiliates of ours and ice group, entered into an investment agreement to partner in the ownership of Nextel Brazil. On July 20, 2017, ice group completed its initial investment of $50.0 million in Nextel Holdings S.à r.l., or Nextel Holdings, a newly formed subsidiary of NII that indirectly owns Nextel Brazil, in exchange for 30% ownership in Nextel Holdings. In connection with the initial investment, ice group received 50.0 million shares of cumulative preferred voting stock in Nextel Holdings, and we received 116.6 million shares of common stock in this entity. The investment agreement also provided ice group with an option, exercisable on or before November 15, 2017, to invest an additional $150.0 million in Nextel Holdings for an additional 30% ownership. ice group did not exercise its option, and on February 27, 2018, we terminated the investment agreement. Since we continue to have a controlling interest in Nextel Brazil, we have consolidated this entity and its subsidiaries.

Prior to the closing of the initial investment by ice group, we contributed $116.6 million in cash to Nextel Holdings. In connection with and subsequent to the closing of the initial investment, we contributed an additional $56.8 million to Nextel Holdings, representing all of our freely distributable cash outside of Nextel Brazil, including proceeds released from escrowed funds from the sale of Nextel Mexico received to date, less $50.0 million we retained for our expenses outside of the partnership. The investment agreement provided for, after ice group’s initial investment, our contribution of proceeds arising from the release of escrowed funds through a 115 account, which is a contribution without the issuance of additional equity. We do not believe that this requirement survives the termination of the investment agreement and intend for all future contributions by us to Nextel Holdings to be made through capital contributions with additional equity being issued to us. ice group has notified us that it believes future escrow proceeds received by us from the escrow account must be contributed to Nextel Holdings through the 115 account without the issuance of equity.
Economic Environment
Recently, Brazil has experienced one of the worst economic recessions in its history, characterized by years of negative real wage growth, a net loss of jobs, higher unemployment and lower consumer confidence. These economic conditions and trends have resulted in a decline in the amount of consumer disposable income that is available to purchase telecommunications services, leading to lower customer credit and pressure on customer demand, pricing and turnover. According to reports issued by the International Monetary Fund, or the IMF, it is estimated that Brazil's gross domestic product, or GDP, fell about 3% from 2015 to 2016. In addition, Brazil's unemployment rate was about 11% at the end of 2016. In 2017, Brazil's GDP improved by about 1% compared to 2016, but unemployment reached the highest it had been in decades at 12% at the end of 2017. Real wages in Brazil fell in the first half of 2017, but grew steadily in the second half of 2017. In addition, the foreign currency exchange rate in Brazil appreciated in value by almost 9% relative to the U.S. dollar during 2017. Although consumer confidence improved by the end of 2017, it remains at lower levels than those experienced in recent prior years. Most economists expect that lower inflation and interest rates at the end of 2017 will help to accelerate growth in Brazil's economy in 2018. 
Competitive Environment
We believe that the wireless communications industry in Brazil has been and will continue to be characterized by intense competition on the basis of price, the types of services offered, speed of data access and quality of service. In recent years, the prices we have been able to charge for services in Brazil have declined as a result of intensified price competition, including the introduction by our competitors of aggressive pricing promotions, such as plans that allow shared minutes between groups of callers and plans that provide more services and in many cases, unlimited calling, for lower rates than some of the plans we offer. In the third quarter of 2017, Nextel Brazil began offering similar types of unlimited voice rate plans in response to the increasingly competitive environment and is actively working to migrate its existing customers to these types of unlimited rate plans and implement other targeted efforts to promote customer loyalty. 
We compete with large, well-capitalized competitors in Brazil that have substantial financial and other resources. Nextel Brazil's largest competitors are Vivo, which is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the largest market share in the São Paulo metropolitan area and Rio de Janeiro; Claro, which is controlled by Mexico's America Movil; TIM, or Telecom Italia Mobile, a subsidiary of Italy's Telecom Italia; and TNL PCS S.A., a subsidiary of Telemar Norte Leste, Brazil's largest wireline incumbent, that offers its services under the brand name “Oi.” 
Many of our competitors have a larger spectrum position than ours, including more spectrum that can be used to support a wide range of wireless technologies, and have greater coverage areas and/or name recognition than we do, making it easier for them to expand into new markets and offer new products and services. Our competitors typically have more extensive distribution channels than ours or are able to use their scale advantages to acquire subscribers at a lower cost than we can, and they have implemented network technology upgrades, including both WCDMA and LTE, that support high speed data services. Some of these competitors also have the ability to offer bundled telecommunications services that include local, long distance, subscription television and data services, and can offer a larger variety of handsets and other devices with a wide range of prices, brands and features. In addition, the financial strength and operating scale of some of these competitors allows them to offer aggressive pricing plans, including those targeted at attracting our existing subscribers.
In recent years, our largest competitors have increasingly focused their marketing efforts on attracting postpaid subscribers within our target segments by, among other things, enhancing their network quality and their customer care functions, which may minimize the value of our network quality and speed and the quality of our customer service as points of differentiation. In addition, as we have extended our target market to include more high-value consumers, we are increasingly competing more directly for subscribers that are also targeted by our largest competitors.

We compete with other communications service providers based primarily on our simple and attractive pricing plans, high quality customer experience and wireless service offerings. We are continuing to pursue our target market with an expanded message that focuses on our transition to a full service wireless operator capable of providing high quality and high speed data services supported by our WCDMA and LTE network. 
We believe that the users who primarily make up our targeted subscriber base are likely to base their purchase decisions on network quality and quality of customer support, as well as on the availability of differentiated features and services that make it easier for them to communicate quickly, efficiently and economically. However, because pricing is one of a number of important factors in potential customers' purchasing decisions, and in light of Brazil's recovering economy discussed above, increased price competition in the customer segments we target could require us to decrease prices or increase service and product offerings, which would lower our revenues, increase our costs or both.
In response to the aggressive nature of Brazil's competitive environment, as well as its recent economic climate, we have taken and are continuing to take the following actions: 

• | offering flexible rate plans in order to meet our customers' individualized needs, including various unlimited voice rate plans at competitive prices;


• | increased our focus on high value customer segments in order to generate higher levels of ARPU;


• | expanding our addressable market;


• | providing a superior customer-centric experience that cultivates a long-term relationship with our customers;


• | streamlining distribution channels, including closing unprofitable retail stores;


• | migrating subscribers from our legacy iDEN network to our WCDMA network; and


• | reviewing commission and subsidy strategies.

As a result of these and other initiatives, in the fourth quarter of 2017, Nextel Brazil had 325,400 WCDMA gross subscriber additions, 26,800 WCDMA net subscriber additions and WCDMA subscriber turnover of 3.47%.
Our Networks and Wireless Technologies
We currently offer services supported by a network that utilizes WCDMA and LTE technology. WCDMA is a standards-based technology being deployed by wireless carriers throughout the world that provides service capabilities such as high speed internet access, increased network capacity and reduced costs for voice and data services when compared to previous technologies. 
In late 2010, Nextel Brazil participated in a series of spectrum auctions and was the successful bidder for 20 megahertz, or MHz, of spectrum in the 1.9/2.1 gigahertz, or GHz, spectrum bands in 11 of the 13 auction lots covering approximately 98% of the Brazilian population for $714.4 million based on foreign currency exchange rates at the time. Nextel Brazil also successfully bid on 20 MHz of spectrum in the 1.8 GHz band in Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and some states in the north and northeast regions of Brazil for a total bid price of approximately $121.7 million. Nextel Brazil is utilizing this 1.9/2.1 GHz spectrum to support its WCDMA network and is utilizing the 1.8 GHz spectrum to support its LTE-based network. The licenses relating to the spectrum won by Nextel Brazil in the auction were granted in June 2011 and have a term of 15 years. These licenses are renewable once for an additional 15-year period and require Nextel Brazil to meet specified network coverage construction requirements within specified timeframes. In December 2015, Nextel Brazil participated in a spectrum auction and was the successful bidder for 30 MHz of spectrum in the 1.8 GHz band for 455.0 million Brazilian reais, or approximately $116.7 million based on foreign currency exchange rates at the time. Nextel Brazil currently offers LTE services in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. These services are automatically available to subscribers with an existing mobile plan and compatible smartphone.
We continue to evaluate ways in which we can use our 800 MHz spectrum to support existing or new services. Our current 800 MHz spectrum holdings are largely contiguous, making it possible to use that spectrum to support future technologies, including LTE-based technologies, if certain technical, operational and regulatory requirements are met, including, for example, the availability of compatible network and subscriber equipment. The availability of that equipment will likely depend upon a number of factors, including the technology decisions made by other wireless carriers and the willingness of infrastructure and device manufacturers to produce the required equipment.

Sales and Distribution
Our target customers include consumer market segments that value our attractive pricing plans, high quality network and our superior level of customer service, as well as the small, medium and large business markets that value our wireless services. We use a variety of distribution channels to reach our target customers, including direct sales representatives, indirect sales agents, retail stores and kiosks, and other subscriber-convenient sales channels such as online purchasing. Nextel Brazil is continuously optimizing the mix of sales channels to take into consideration the methods that best meet local subscriber preferences, most cost effectively sell and provide support to our different segments and facilitate our overall strategy of attracting and retaining subscribers in our targeted segments.
We employ sales representatives who market our services directly to potential and existing customers. The focus of our direct sales force is primarily on customers that value our industry expertise and services, as well as our ability to develop tailored custom communications capabilities that meet the specific needs of these customers. We also utilize indirect sales agents, which mainly consist of local and national non-affiliated dealers that solicit customers for our service and are generally paid through commissions. These dealers participate with Nextel Brazil's direct sales force in varying degrees when pursuing each of our targeted customer groups.
Our sales channels also include distribution through subscriber-convenient channels, including telesales and sales through our Nextel retail stores, shopping center kiosks and other locations. We have realigned these sales channels and locations and have also expanded our marketing through regional and national retailers with store kiosks and handset and prepaid card distribution offers. We also utilize our website as a marketing tool that allows subscribers to compare our various rate plans and research our suite of products and services, including handsets, accessories and special promotions. We use a digital platform and other online purchase tools as additional sales channels to allow subscribers to purchase our services directly without any interaction with a Nextel representative. Subscribers can purchase a SIM card at an accredited point of sale, install the SIM card on an Android or iOS smartphone, download the application, and activate and change rate plans. 
Marketing
We are a full service provider of wireless services, offering our customers packages of services and features that combine multiple communications services in one handset, including voice and data services. Since 2002, we have offered services under the Nextel brand under a trademark license agreement with Nextel Communications, Inc. In 2011, we launched a new brand identity, which we believe enhanced the recognition of our brand. As a result of our efforts, the Nextel brand is recognized in Brazil as standing for both quality of service and the customer support we provide. Our marketing strategy is focused on the availability of the broad range of services and features offered by our WCDMA and LTE networks that we believe appeals to a wide range of consumers. The positioning of our brand continues to focus on customers who are attracted to our services and our reputation for providing a high quality customer experience. 
Regulation of SMR and PCS Operations 
In Brazil, the wireless communications regulations are based on a concept called calling party pays, which requires the mobile carrier of the subscriber initiating a call to pay the mobile carrier of the party receiving the call when mobile calls occur between subscribers of different carriers. These calling party pays charges are based on rates that we refer to as mobile termination rates. In 2012, ANATEL, Brazil's telecommunications regulatory agency, approved regulations to implement a transition to a cost-based model for determining mobile termination rates, and under the current regulations, the mobile termination rates are being gradually reduced over a transition period ending in 2019, when cost-based rates will take effect and we will likely pay the same rates as our competitors.
Foreign Currency Controls, Dividends and Tax Regulation 
The purchase and sale of foreign currency in Brazil continues to be subject to regulation by the Central Bank of Brazil despite regulatory changes enacted in 2005 that were designed to reduce the level of government regulation of foreign currency transactions. The purchase of currency for repatriation of capital invested in Brazil and for payment of dividends to foreign stockholders of Brazilian companies may only be made if the original investment of foreign capital and capital increases were registered with the Brazilian Central Bank. Nextel Brazil has registered substantially all of its investments with the Brazilian Central Bank.

Brazilian law provides that the Brazilian government may, for a limited period of time, impose restrictions on the remittance by Brazilian companies to foreign investors of the proceeds of investments in Brazil whenever there is a material imbalance or a serious risk of a material imbalance in Brazil’s balance of payments. The Brazilian government may also impose restrictions on the conversion of Brazilian currency into foreign currency. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 2,288 employees, of which 2,273 were employees of Nextel Brazil. Nextel Brazil is a party to a legally mandated collective bargaining agreement that covers most of its employees and expires on August 31, 2018. NII Holdings is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. We believe that the relationship between us and our employees, and between Nextel Brazil and its employees, is good.
