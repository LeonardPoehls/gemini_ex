ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that benefit patients with unmet medical needs. We currently have two product candidates, Sollpura, formally known as liprotamase, and blisibimod.  We licensed Sollpura from Eli Lilly & Co (“Eli Lilly”) in July 2014.  SollpuraTM is a novel non-porcine investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (“PERT”) intended for the treatment of patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (“EPI”), often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.  We licensed blisibimod from Amgen, Inc. (“Amgen”) in December 2007. Blisibimod targets B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including Immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or IgA nephropathy, systemic lupus erythematosus (“SLE”), or lupus, lupus nephritis, and others.
Summary of Product Development Programs
 


* Continued access study provided to patients who previously completed the SOLUTION study. We plan to modifiy the study to allow patients completing future studies (e.g., RESULT or SIMPLICITY Part B) to have continued access and continue the EASY study until the Biologic License Application (“BLA”) for Sollpura is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).

Our Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy Portfolio
 
Difference between Sollpura and Current PERT
 




 The exocrine pancreas is responsible for synthesis and secretion of digestive enzymes, including lipase, protease, and amylase. In addition, the pancreas secretes bicarbonate into the duodenum to neutralize the very high acidity of stomach contents. EPI occurs when diseases such as CF and chronic pancreatitis impede or destroy the exocrine function of the pancreas. A reduction in, or absence of the normally secreted pancreatic digestive enzymes, causes lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates to enter the distal gastrointestinal (“GI”) tract in un-absorbable forms, leading to GI pain and distention, mal-digestion, and steatorrhea. Without appropriate therapy, patients with EPI may experience malnutrition, poor growth or weight loss, reduced quality of life, and, in severe cases, increased morbidity and early death.
 
PERT is currently the mainstay of treatment for nutrient malabsorption in patients with digestive enzyme deficiencies known as EPI and orally delivered porcine PERTs have been available for many years for its treatment.   As the porcine-derived proteins contained in the PERTs pass through the low pH environment of the stomach, they are protected by the enteric coating until they reach a pH of approximately 5.6 or greater in the duodenum and then are rapidly released. Patient-to-patient differences in the acidity of the upper intestine makes dissolution of enterically-coated products variable, and gives rise to alterations in the rate and extent to which enzymes are released from these products. Poor stability and variability in terms of potency and pharmaceutical properties have also been identified as important factors contributing to a poor response of some patients to PERTs.


Sollpura is a novel non-porcine PERT that contains three biotechnology-derived digestive enzymes: a lipase, a protease and an amylase. Through enzyme cross-linking, the lipase enzyme in Sollpura is more stable than the porcine derived lipase in the low pH environment of the stomach and therefore Sollpura does not have an enteric polymer coating.  Furthermore, since the three enzymes in Sollpura are biotechnology-derived, Sollpura does not contain porcine proteins or purines that may be associated with a risk of viral transmission or allergic reaction to proteins of porcine origin. The individual enzyme components of Sollpura are formulated at a fixed ratio of lipase, protease, and amylase.  The Sollpura enzyme dose ratio was selected from preclinical efficacy studies conducted using a canine model of pancreatic insufficiency which demonstrated that the lipase enzyme in Sollpura was efficacious when administered at >500 units/kg per meal, and the protease doses >1000 units/kg per meal.  This finding is further supported by the similar efficacy observed between Sollpura and Creon in pigs with surgically-induced pancreatic insufficiency.
 
We believe Sollpura is potentially the first soluble, stable and non-porcine derived enzyme product to offer a novel solution to patients who are unable to maintain appropriate nutritional health. Sollpura’s chemical characteristics, unlike currently available PERTs, make it ideal for powder formulation as either a capsule, or sachet of powder for oral solution which can be conveniently administered in solution in a small volume of water.

Our Phase 3 Development of Sollpura in EPI
 
We initiated the Phase 3 SOLUTION study in the third quarter of 2015.  SOLUTION is a randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Sollpura in patients with cystic fibrosis-related exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. This pivotal study enrolled 128 patients in North America, Europe and Israel to evaluate the non-inferiority of Sollpura compared with another commercially available PERT in a population of porcine-derived PERT responders. Topline data announced in December 2016 showed that the study narrowly missed the Coefficient of Fat Absorption (“CFA”) non-inferiority margin of the primary modified Intent to Treat population (mITT) analysis by 1%; however, by additional pre-specified analyses of CFA (mITT-Baseline Observation Carried Forward and Per Protocol), Sollpura met the non-inferiority criterion. The study also confirmed that the ratio of the three enzymes in Sollpura demonstrated an appropriate response in the Coefficient of Nitrogen Absorption (CNA).  CNA is a measure of protein digestion and absorption and is a key requirement of our planned United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulatory submission. Data from the SOLUTION study identified that, for some patients, higher doses may be necessary to compensate for the lower solubility of Sollpura under the acidic upper small intestinal conditions found in many patients with EPI due to CF. We expect to release data from the extension phase of the study towards the end of first quarter of 2017.
 
Impact of Sollpura on CFA (Primary Endpoint) in the Phase 3 SOLUTION Study
 
 
Impact of Sollpura on CNA (Secondary Endpoint) in the Phase 3 SOLUTION Study
 


Because the SOLUTION study failed to achieve its primary endpoint by only one 1%, we plan to initiate a new Phase 3 study, informed by the SOLUTION study data, which we refer to as the RESULT study. The RESULT study is expected to commence in the first half of  2017.  Similar to the SOLUTION study, the RESULT study will also be a randomized, open-label, assessor- blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator study. Approximately 150 cystic fibrosis patients who are porcine PERT responders will be enrolled in similar geographies as the SOLUTION study. Based on data from the SOLUTION study, the planned RESULT study’s design is being modified to (1) start Sollpura dosing as 125% of the pre-study PERT dose, and (2) allow for a more liberal dose titration, as needed, based on signs and symptoms throughout the primary treatment phase of the study. We believe that efficacy in the SOLUTION study was limited by a restrictive dose optimization paradigm in a population whose dose of lipase at baseline had been optimized for porcine PERTs (but not Sollpura) and that modification of the dosing paradigm may allow for success in the RESULT study. Topline data from the RESULT study is expected towards the end of 2017 or in early 2018.

A second, smaller Phase 3 study, SIMPLICITY, was initiated in the second quarter of 2016.  The SIMPLICITY study utilizes sachets containing Sollpura powder for oral solution. We expect to enroll approximately 46 patients in the two parts of the study (Part A and Part B). Part A of the SIMPLICITY study, which evaluated the safety and general usability of the Sollpura powder for oral solution in 15 patients aged 7 years or older, was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (the “DMC”) evaluated the data from Part A and in its determination that it is safe to proceed with enrolling pediatric subjects less than 7 years of age in Part B of the study, unanimously approved the initiation of Part B of the study. Based on the data produced by the SOLUTION study, we plan to amend the SIMPLICITY study to follow similar dosing paradigm as the RESULT study. Part B of SIMPLICITY study will commence enrollment towards the middle of 2017. We expect to fully enroll the SIMPLICITY study and to report topline data around the end of 2017 or the early 2018 depending upon study initiation timeline.
  
During the third quarter of 2016, we initiated the EASY study, which provides continued access to Sollpura for patients who completed the SOLUTION study.  The EASY study will also be offered to patients completing RESULT and SIMPLICITY studies.  We currently plan to continue the EASY study until the BLA for Sollpura is approved by the FDA.


We believe our Sollpura studies may offer a number of potential opportunities for differentiation versus the currently marketed porcine-derived PERTs, including:

Blisibimod
 
BAFF, or B-cell Activating Factor (also known as B lymphocyte stimulator or BLyS), is a member of a tumor necrosis family of natural human proteins and is critical to the development, maintenance and survival of multiple B-cell lineages as well as plasma cells – all of which are critical to the human immune response.  B-cells and plasma cells are a vital part of the human immune system, producing natural antibody responses to invading pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and other dangerous antigens.  Abnormally high elevations of BAFF, B-cells and plasma cells have been associated with several autoimmune diseases, including lupus and IgA nephropathy.  BAFF is primarily expressed by macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells and interacts with three different receptors on B-cells and plasma cells including BAFF receptor, or BAFF-R, B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, and transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor, or TACI. The potential role of BAFF inhibition and associated reductions in B-cell and plasma cell numbers in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis has been validated in multiple clinical studies with blisibimod and other BAFF antagonists.
 
Blisibimod, a peptibody directed against BAFF, was developed as an alternative to antibodies and is produced in Escherichia coli bacterial culture, as opposed to antibodies that are typically produced in mammalian cell culture. A peptibody is a novel fusion protein that is distinct from an antibody with several potential advantages, including ease of manufacture, potency and relatively small molecular weight. Blisibimod inhibits both soluble and membrane-bound BAFF.

Our Phase 2 Development of Blisibimod for Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy
 
According to the National Organization of Rare Disease, IgA nephropathy, an orphan indication, is believed to affect approximately 130,000 people annually in the United States. In Asia, a higher reported prevalence is attributed to the routine urinalyses that are often performed for school children, and renal biopsies are performed for any patients with asymptomatic hematuria. According to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 25% of adults with IgA nephropathy eventually develop total kidney failure. IgA is a human antibody that helps the body fight infections. IgA nephropathy may occur when plasma B-cells express excessive amounts of abnormal IgA and subsequent immune complexes containing this immunogenic protein are deposited in the kidneys. These IgA containing immune complexes deposit in the mesangium of glomeruli in the kidney and are proinflammatory. As a result kidney glomeruli become inflamed and damaged, leading to leakage of blood and protein into urine. According to a recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine (Wyatt & Julian, 2013), primary IgA nephropathy occurs at any age, most commonly with clinical onset in the second and third decades of life, and a large number of cases eventually progress to renal failure.
 
In patients with IgA nephropathy, levels of BAFF are significantly higher than in healthy individuals, and elevated levels of BAFF are associated with histological severity of disease in kidney tissue. In IgA nephropathy, increased plasma B-cells express immunogenic IgA that forms immune complexes that deposit in renal tissue and lead to renal inflammation and damage that can progress to renal failure and end-stage renal disease. Significant reductions in plasma B-cells were observed in previous clinical studies of patients with lupus with another BAFF inhibitor antibody, belimumab. In our PEARL-SC Phase 2b study and our CHABLIS-SC1 Phase 3 study, significant reductions in total B-cells as well as significant improvements in proteinuria and increases in complement C3 were observed with blisibimod in lupus patients. We believe inhibition of BAFF may reduce proliferative B-cells and plasma B-cells, reduce serum levels of IgA and therefore reduce progressive renal damage in patients with IgA nephropathy.
 
In June 2013, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study, BRIGHT-SC study. The BRIGHT-SC study is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy. Enrollment criteria are biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy and proteinuria greater than one gram per 24 hours (1g/24hr).  Patients must be receiving standard of care medication including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Patients enrolled in the BRIGHT-SC study receive 300mg weekly blisibimod or placebo subcutaneously during the first 8 weeks of therapy, the induction phase, followed by a minimum of 24 weeks of 200mg weekly blisibimod or placebo, the maintenance phase. The BRIGHT-SC clinical study has enrolled patients in Southeast Asia, the European Union (“EU”) and Eastern Europe.   
 
In March 2015, an interim futility analysis of BRIGHT-SC study was conducted by an independent unblinded statistician, who evaluated several important biomarkers of renal disease in patients who had completed at least 8 weeks of treatment and recommended the study to continue to completion as planned.  
 
In December 2016, an additional interim analysis of the BRIGHT-SC study was reported.  This analysis, which was conducted when the last subject enrolled had completed the Week 48 assessments, confirmed and extended the observations from the analysis in June 2016 with more subjects contributing to the later timepoint in the analysis. Of the original 57 patients enrolled into the study, 44 had a Week 48 observation and 22 patients had a Week 96 observation at the time of this analysis.  As with the analysis in June 2016, the numerical reduction in proteinuria in blisibimod versus placebo treated patients at Week 48 did not meet the predefined statistical primary endpoint of complete or partial response. However, a tendency toward slowing proteinuria progression was again observed with blisibimod. In contrast, over the same period the mean PCR worsened by almost 1.5 g/g in subjects randomized to placebo. Concomitant decreases were observed in B cells and immunoglobulins with blisibimod compared with placebo which supports the hypothesized mechanism of action that blisibimod-mediated BAFF inhibition acts to reduce peripheral B cells and immunoglobulins, and may prevent deterioration of PCR levels in IgA nephropathy.  Given the positive effect observed in this analysis, Anthera plans to continue to follow the subjects enrolled in the BRIGHT study to gain more understanding of the long-term effects of blisibimod on disease progression.

 Market Opportunity
 
Sollpura for the treatment of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI)
 
According to our estimate, EPI is a disease that affects an estimated 130,000 patients in the United States.  The most common causes of EPI are chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis, the former a longstanding inflammation of the pancreas altering the organ's normal structure and function that can result from malnutrition, heredity, or (in the western world especially), behavior (alcohol use and smoking), and the latter a recessive hereditary disease most common in Europeans and Ashkenazi Jews where the molecular culprit is an altered, CFTR-encoded chloride channel. In children, another common cause is Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from mutation in the SBDS gene.
 
Blisibimod for the treatment of IgA Nephropathy
 
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is a human antibody that plays a critical role in mucosal immunity, which provides protection to an organism’s various mucous membranes from invasion by infections. IgA nephropathy (also known as IgA nephritis or Berger's disease) is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli of the kidney) throughout the world and a principal cause of end-stage renal disease. The prevalence of IgA nephropathy varies throughout the world, with the highest prevalence in Asia (Singapore, Japan and China), Australia, Finland and southern Europe (20 to 40% of all glomerulonephritis).  IgA nephropathy occurs when too much of this protein, especially aberrant and immunogenic forms of IgA, are recognized by other immunoglobulins, forming proinflammatory immune complexes which are deposited in the kidney. As a result kidney glomeruli become inflamed and damaged, leading to leakage of blood and protein into urine. The classic presentation (in 40-50% of the cases) is episodic frank hematuria which usually starts within a day or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection or (less commonly) gastrointestinal or urinary infection. All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production.
 
According to the National Organization for Rare Diseases, primary IgA nephropathy occurs at any age, most commonly with clinical onset in the second and third decades of life and a large number of cases eventually progress to renal failure. There is also a striking geographic variation in the prevalence of IgA nephropathy throughout the world. In the United States, IgA nephropathy is considered an orphan disease as it is believed to affect approximately 130,000 people annually. In Asia, routine urinalyses are performed for school children, and renal biopsies are performed for patients with asymptomatic hematuria and the reported prevalence of the disease is much higher. For example, in Japan, IgA nephropathy is estimated to affect over 350,000 people annually. According to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 25% of adults with IgA nephropathy eventually develop total kidney failure.

Manufacturing Strategy
 
Sollpura
 
Technology transfer to commercial scale active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing and drug product manufacturing CMOs was initiated in 2015 and completed in late 2016.  The large scale fermentation and the associated down-stream process validation activities for all three enzyme APIs are anticipated to be complete in late 2017 to early 2018.  In parallel, commercial scale capsule and sachet drug product manufacturing process validation is anticipated to be completed in late 2017 to early 2018.
Blisibimod
 
In December 2011, we completed the manufacturing site transfer from Amgen to our contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”), Fujifilm Diosynth Bioservices (“Fujifilm”). We also scaled up manufacturing from 300 liters up to 3,000 liters. Three batches of blisibimod produced under U.S. and EU good manufacturing procedures (“GMPs”), at the 3,000 liter scale passed all physical quality specifications and comparability assessments.
Regulatory Strategy
 
Sollpura

In 2013, our licensor, Eli Lilly, gained agreement from the FDA on the design of a Phase 3 clinical study (SOLUTION) that would provide adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety of Sollpura to respond to the FDA’s 2011 complete response letter. We completed the SOLUTION study and reported topline data in December 2016. The SOLUTION study narrowly missed the primary endpoint by one percent. As a result of the narrow miss we intend to initiate a new Phase 3 study, RESULT, incorporating the learnings from the SOLUTION study. The RESULT study should also address the 2005 EMA protocol assistance comments, which were consistent with the FDA’s request for an active comparator trial. 
 
IgA Nephropathy
 
In September 2013, we met with the FDA who agreed to consider accepting proteinuria as an endpoint for Subpart E approval for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy. In April 2014, we met with the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) to discuss our registration program for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy. In this meeting we gained the PMDA’s agreement on the acceptability of proteinuria as the primary efficacy endpoint to support marketing approval in Japan and have amended the BRIGHT-SC study to include the specific data requirements of the PMDA. In December 2014 we met with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) as part of the scientific advice process for blisibimod.  We reached an agreement with the EMA on the acceptability of proteinuria as the primary efficacy variable as well as the requirement for a single study to support a Conditional Marketing Authorization Application (“CMAA”) provided that confirmatory evidence from a second study, would be available post approval. The EMA also recommended the protocol to provide information on the required duration of treatment, duration of response and need for re-treatment. Data generated from the analyses of the BRIGHT-SC study at week 24 and 48 will be used to guide the final study design elements for the Phase 3 registration study protocol.
 
We continue to dose patients in our Phase 2 BRIGHT-SC clinical study for the treatment of patients with IgA nephropathy, an orphan disease.  As a result of the proteinuria effect after 48 weeks of dosing, and the demonstration of blisibimod’s effect on immunological markers relevant to IgA nephropathy including reductions of B cells, and immunoglobulins including IgA, IgG and IgM, we plan to continue the study until the majority of subjects have had the opportunity to complete two years of treatment. Based on our previous discussions with regulatory authorities, we believe an evaluation of the change in proteinuria could serve as a surrogate endpoint to support an accelerated or conditional approval in various key commercial geographies. In December 2016, we submitted an orphan designation request to the US FDA. The FDA agreed that IgAN meets the regulatory definition of a serious condition. Following the completion of the BRIGHT-SC study we intend to explore a Special Protocol Assessment from the US FDA to ensure final concurrence on the willingness to consider proteinuria as a surrogate endpoint, the timing for completion of enrollment of the post marketing confirmatory study.
 
Historical Clinical Studies by Licensor - Sollpura
 
Sollpura was studied from 2002 to 2009 in seven clinical trials, in which a total of 492 unique subjects received at least 1 dose of Sollpura.  Three Phase 1 trials were conducted, 1 in healthy volunteers and 2 in subjects with EPI due to CF.  Two short-term trials, the Phase 2 Study TC-2A, and the Phase 3 Study 726 evaluated the efficacy of Sollpura in subjects ≥7 years of age with EPI due to CF.  Two long-term Phase 3 safety and tolerability trials were also conducted:  Study 767 in subjects with EPI due to CF and Study 810 in subjects with EPI due to chronic pancreatitis/pancreatectomy.  Completed clinical trials demonstrated that dietary fat and nitrogen (protein) absorption are significantly increased in patients with cystic fibrosis and EPI who received Sollpura. In 2013, Eli Lilly gained agreement from the FDA on the design of a pivotal trial that would provide adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety.

The dose-ranging Phase 1 study TC-1B evaluated five dose levels across a 50-fold range, from 100-to-5000 lipase units (U) per kg per meal in CF-EPI subjects. In this study, greater improvements in nutrients absorption, as measured using the percent change from baseline in the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) and coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA), were observed at doses of 500 lipase U per kg per meal and higher.
 
Study TC-2A, a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, dose-finding trial, was conducted in 125 pediatric and adult subjects with CF-related EPI who were treated with Sollpura in one of three dosing regimens containing 6,500 U, 32,500 U, and 130,000 U lipase administered per meal or snack. Observed mean CFAs at the end of study were 56.2%, 67.0%, and 69.7% in the 6,500, 32,500, and 130,000 U dose groups, respectively (one-way ANOVA p = 0.0032) with significant improvements in mean changes from baseline (one-way ANOVA p = 0.0005). Pairwise comparison of the CFA values showed that statistically greater improvements were observed at the higher doses of Sollpura compared with the lowest dose of 6,500 U. Similar improvements in the CNA, were observed with Sollpura at the two highest dose levels.
 


Study 726, a Phase 3, placebo-controlled, parallel design, multinational clinical, evaluated the effects of a single capsule of Sollpura (containing 32,500 U lipase, with protease and amylase in fixed ratios) or placebo administered with every meal or snack in subjects with cystic fibrosis-related EPI. Among the 138 subjects enrolled in this study, treatment with Sollpura resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline in the CFA of 21.2% with Sollpura compared with 6.0% with placebo (p = 0.0011).  The median body weight of subjects in this trial was 50 kg, for which the corresponding Sollpura dose was 650 U lipase/kg/meal or snack.
 


Two one-year studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and effects on nutritional status of Sollpura. Study 810 evaluated adult subjects with EPI due to CP or after pancreatectomy. Among the 214 subjects who were treated, an average dose of 5.5 capsules (containing 32,500 U lipase, with protease and amylase in fixed ratios) of Sollpura per day maintained nutritional status as assessed by serial measurement of height and weight, including age-appropriate growth and weight gain in children. Mean BMI z-scores for subjects in Study 767 were maintained over time on study (mean BMI z-score at baseline, Months 3, 6, and 12 were -0.503,-0.637, -0.688, and -0.655, respectively).
 
Historical Clinical Studies - Blisibimod
 
To date, five randomized, clinical studies have been conducted with blisibimod in patients with lupus: two Phase 1 dose-ranging studies by our licensor, Amgen, two double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging clinical outcomes studies, PEARL-SC (Phase 2b) and CHABLIS-SC1 (Phase 3), and a Phase 2 Open-Label Extension study (OLE). All five clinical studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of subcutaneous blisibimod versus placebo in patients with active and seropositive lupus. The PEARL-SC study was completed in June 2012 and the CHABLIS-SC1 study was completed in November 2016. Both studies failed to meet the primary endpoints and we elected to stop further development of blisibimod for the treatment of lupus.
 
In the CHABLIS-SC1 study, the primary endpoint compared the effects of blisibimod and placebo at Week 52 using the SLE Responder Index-6 (SRI-6): ≥6-point improvement in SELENA-SLEDAI, no new BILAG 1A or 2B domain scores, and <0.3-point increase in Physician’s Global Assessment. Compared with placebo, a higher proportion of subjects on blisibimod met the SRI-6 criteria from Week 16 through Week 52. However, this effect was not statistically significant at the primary endpoint analysis at Week 52. Significant changes in SLE-relevant disease markers were observed with blisibimod, including reductions in urinary protein:creatinine ratio, peripheral B cell lineages, anti-dsDNA, anti-phospholipid antibodies, and serum immunoglobulins, and significant increases in complement C3 and C4. We believe the latter effects support the ongoing research with blisibimod into IgA nephropathy.  As a result of the outcomes of the CHABLIS-SC1 trial, at the end of 2016, we elected to discontinue the Phase 3 CHABLIS-7.5 study, which was initiated in June 2016.
 
Research and Development
 
Since our inception in 2004, we have focused primarily on developing our product candidates, which currently include Sollpura and blisibimod. We currently focus our clinical development and research efforts on Sollpura, as an enzyme replacement therapy for EPI, and blisibimod, which is being developed for a renal disease, IgA nephropathy.  In the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred $46.5 million, $33.6 million and $21.8 million, respectively, of research and development expense.

Our Strategy
 
Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation, including enzyme replacement therapies and renal disease. To achieve these objectives, we intend to initially focus on the following activities.
Advancing Clinical Development of Sollpura and Blisibimod
 
We are advancing the development of Sollpura in a Phase 3 registration program in patients with cystic fibrosis-related EPI.  We are also advancing the development of blisibimod to evaluate the broad potential clinical utility of BAFF antagonism. We may opportunistically enter into collaborations with third parties for development of Sollpura and blisibimod, including securing corporate partners whose capabilities complement ours.
Developing Commercial Strategies Designed to Maximize Our Product Candidates’ Market Potential
 
Our product candidates are focused on highly-specialized physician segments, such as cystic fibrosis specialists and nephrologists. We believe that we can build a small, focused sales force capable of marketing our products effectively in acute care and orphan indications.
Competition
 
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.  Our primary competitors are described in further detail below, under “Approved Categories of Drugs”. We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
 
Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
 
Approved Categories of Drugs for EPI
 
There are currently several marketed products for EPI caused by cystic fibrosis, including Creon marketed by AbbVie, Inc., Pancreaze by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pertzye by Cornerstone Therapeutics, Inc., and Ultresa and Zenpep by Aptalis Pharma US. Inc.  Alcresta recently gained marketing approval for its product, Relizorb, which utilizes a digestive lipase enzyme, and is designed for use by adults on enteral tube feeding who have trouble breaking down and absorbing dietary fats.  We are aware of one company with other products in development that are being tested for potential treatment of EPI caused by cystic fibrosis: Nordmark Arzneimittel GmbH & Co. KG’s compound, Burlulipase (also known as NM-BL), recently completed a Phase 1/Phase 2 study in patients with EPI.

• | obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | defend our patents;
--+--------------------


• | preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sollpura
 
As of the date of this report, our Sollpura portfolio is made up of exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Eli Lilly, including:
 
 
• | Two issued U.S. patents;
--+-------------------------


• | Four issued European (EP) patents, each validated in one or more of Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 14 issued non-EP foreign patents in Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea and Ukraine; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-------------------------------------------------



We hold exclusive worldwide licenses from Eli Lilly to all of these patents and patent applications.  The exclusively licensed U.S. patents are currently scheduled to expire in March 2025 and July 2028.  Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of Sollpura, one of these U.S. patents may be eligible for a patent term restoration of up to five years under Hatch-Waxman Act. See “—Regulatory Matters— Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity.” This could extend the expiration date of the selected U.S. Patent to as late as March 2030 or July 2033, depending on which patent the term restoration is applied to. We intend to pursue pediatric exclusivity as well, which could add an additional six months to the patent term. The three exclusively licensed EP patents are currently scheduled to expire between February 2021 and October 2025. One of these patents may be eligible for a Supplementary Protection Certificate of up to five years, which could extend the expiration date to between February 2026 and October 2030.

• | Four pending non-EP foreign patent applications in Brazil, Hong Kong, Mexico, and Poland.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We hold exclusive worldwide licenses from Amgen to all of these patents and patent applications. In addition, we hold a non-exclusive worldwide license to one issued U.S. patent, one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, one EP patent, one pending EP patent application, and over 50 non-EP foreign patents and pending patent applications relating to general peptibody compositions and formulations. 
 
The four exclusively licensed U.S. patents are currently scheduled to expire in May 2022, March 2023 and November 2023. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of blisibimod, one of these U.S. patents (or another patent issuing from a related patent application) is expected to be eligible for a patent term restoration of up to five years under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. See “—Regulatory Matters— Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity.” This could extend the expiration date of the U.S. Patent to as late as May 2027, March 2028 or November 2028, depending on which patent the term restoration is applied to. We intend to pursue pediatric exclusivity as well, which could add an additional six months to the patent term. The exclusively licensed EP patents are currently scheduled to expire in May 2022. One of these patents is expected to be eligible for a Supplementary Protection Certificate of up to five years, which could extend the expiration date to May 2027.
 
The U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications. A non-provisional patent application is examined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability. A provisional patent application is not examined, and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date. As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into a patent. The requirements for filing a provisional patent application are not as strict as those for filing a non-provisional patent application. Provisional applications are often used, among other things, to establish an early filing date for a subsequent non-provisional patent application.
 
The filing date of a non-provisional patent application is used by the USPTO to determine what information is prior art when it considers the patentability of a claimed invention. If certain requirements are satisfied, a non-provisional patent application can claim the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed provisional patent application. As a result, the filing date accorded by the provisional patent application may remove information that otherwise could preclude the patentability of an invention.
 
We are aware of two third-party issued U.S. patents that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides. Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents. If we were to challenge the validity of either of these issued U.S. patents in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every U.S. patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent’s claims. There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits. If third-party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and possibly requiring us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product. Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
 
Current License Agreements
 
Amgen
 
In December 2007, we entered into a license agreement with Amgen, which was amended in October 2009 and November 2014 (as amended, the “Amgen Agreement”), pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to blisibimod, as well as a non-exclusive worldwide license to technology relating to certain peptibody compositions of matter and formulations.
 
Under the Amgen Agreement, we obtained exclusive rights under the licensed patents and know-how to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import pharmaceutical products containing blisibimod, as well as the right to grant sublicenses. The licensed patents included a specific set of previously filed U.S. and foreign patents and applications, as well as any applications filed after the execution date by Amgen and covering licensed know-how. During the period of the agreement, we are responsible for the filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance of all exclusively licensed blisibimod patents and applications. Amgen retains the right to review all documents relating to said filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance, and we are required to incorporate all reasonable comments or suggestions that Amgen makes with regard to these documents.
 
During the seven-year period after execution of the agreement, Amgen is prohibited from clinically developing or commercializing any BAFF peptibody. Similarly, we are prohibited during the term of the agreement from clinically developing or commercializing any molecule other than blisibimod that modulates BAFF as the primary intended therapeutic mechanism of action.
 

16
 


Pursuant to the terms of the Amgen Agreement, we have paid $6.0 million in license fees to Amgen for blisibimod. In addition, we are required to make various milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives, including payment upon commencement of the first Phase 3 clinical study for any blisibimod formulation in the United States, European Union or Japan. We are also required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones. Furthermore, we are required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low double digits as net sales increase. Our royalty payment obligations for a particular product in a particular country begin on the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in that country, and end upon the later of 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in that country or the expiration date of the last valid claim of a licensed patent that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell or import of the product.
 
The Amgen Agreement will remain in effect until we elect to terminate, or until termination for material breach by either party or insolvency on our part. Under these terms, Amgen can terminate the agreement if we fail to meet our obligations, resulting in a loss of our exclusive rights to the licensed technology.
 
In connection with a collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku for the development of IgA nephropathy that was executed in December 2014 and terminated in January 2016, we amended the Amgen Agreement in November 2014 to (i) adjust certain royalty and milestone payment obligations payable to Amgen in light of our collaboration with Zenyaku and (ii) provide that the sublicense granted by us to Zenyaku shall survive the termination of the Amgen Agreement.  Under this amendment, we also agreed to grant Amgen that number of shares of our common stock equal to $1.0 million divided by the volume weighted average price of our common stock for 20 trading days prior to issuance.  We issued 420,751 shares of common stock to Amgen at $2.3767 per share on January 28, 2015 pursuant to a subscription agreement with Amgen, with the consideration paid by Amgen in the form of a waiver of a fee otherwise payable to Amgen under the Amgen Agreement.
 
Eli Lilly and Company
 
On July 11, 2014, we entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement with Eli Lilly (the “Lilly Agreement”), to develop and commercialize Sollpura, a Phase 3 novel investigational PERT for the treatment of patients with EPI, often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions. Under the terms of the Lilly Agreement, we were not required to make any up-front payment but we are obligated to make milestone payments of up to $33.5 million for capsule products and $9.5 million for reformulated products upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sales milestones, none of which have been achieved as of December 31, 2015.  In addition, after sales of the licensed products exceed an aggregate of $100.0 million in the United States, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties on future net sales of products, ranging from the single digits to the mid-teens for products that are developed and approved as defined in the Lilly Agreement. Our royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by us or a sublicense in such country, or (b) 12 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd.
 
On December 11, 2014, we entered into the Zenyaku Agreement with Zenyaku, pursuant to which we granted Zenyaku an exclusive license to certain patent rights, know-how and other intellectual property relating to blisibimod.  In September 2015, Zenyaku provided us a notice of its intent to terminate the Zenyaku Agreement, effective January 7, 2016.  The termination was “at will” and Zenyaku alleged no breach of the Zenyaku Agreement by us.  We did not incur any termination penalties in connection with the early termination of the Zenyaku Agreement by Zenyaku.  As of the date of termination, no patients had been enrolled in any blisibimod clinical studies in the Zenyaku territory and Zenyaku had not purchased any blisibimod product from us.  As a result of the termination on January 7, 2016, we regained full worldwide rights for blisibimod.
Manufacturing and Supply
 
We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies under current GMP with oversight by our internal managers. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidates if and when approved for marketing by the FDA. Should a supplier or a manufacturer on which we have relied to produce product candidates provide us with faulty products or such products are later recalled, we would likely experience significant delays and material additional costs.
 
Our contract manufacturers obtain the raw materials for the drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies from a variety of sources. We believe that this will provide a sufficient supply of these raw materials and drug product to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. We do not have in place long term supply agreements with respect to all of the components of any of our pharmaceutical systems, however, and are subject to the risk that we may not be able to procure all required components in adequate quantities with acceptable quality, within acceptable time frames or at reasonable cost.
 

17
 


Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including toxic chemical and biological materials. Accordingly, we are subject to federal, state and local laws governing the use, handling and disposal of these materials. We believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by local, state and federal regulations.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Given our stage of development, we have not developed a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We expect that we would develop these capabilities once we receive Phase 3 data in contemplation of FDA approval and the commercial launch of our product candidates. In order to commercialize our product candidates, we must develop these capabilities internally or through collaboration with third parties. In selected therapeutic areas where we feel that any approved products can be commercialized by a specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians, we may seek to commercialize the product candidates alone. We also plan to seek commercialization partners for products in international markets.
 
We intend to build the commercial infrastructure necessary to bring our product candidates to market. In addition to a specialty sales force, sales management, internal sales support and an internal marketing group, we will need to establish capabilities to manage key accounts, such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies and government accounts. We may also choose to employ medical sales liaisons personnel to support the product.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either the new drug application, or NDA, process, or the biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may legally be marketed in the United States. Both of our drug candidates, Sollpura and blisibimod, are biologically manufactured and will go through the BLA process for approval if successful in Phase 3.
United States Drug Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations and biological products under both the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biological product for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug or BLA for a biological product;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug or biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
--+-------------------------------------------




18
 


The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Once a pharmaceutical or biological product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy.  An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period.  In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. Clinical holds may also be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
 
All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or to his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.  Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA for review, and to the IRBs for approval.
 
Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 
 
• | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA.  Safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 days after the sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure.  A sponsor also must notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within 7 days after the sponsor’s receipt of the information.  Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, a data safety monitoring board, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidates and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
 
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug or biological product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug or BLA for a biological product, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 

19
 


In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, which was reauthorized under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP- compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, has an acceptable purity profile and is adequately potent, and whether its manufacturing meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued identity, sterility, safety, purity and potency. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA on matters of importance that come before the agency. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee but it generally follows such recommendations.
 
The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess a drug or biological product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent terms for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain competitor applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. HR 3590 provides 12 years of data exclusivity for innovator biologics. During this exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator’s safety and efficacy data to gain FDA approval. Therefore, a competitor seeking to obtain marketing approval during this exclusivity period would be required to conduct its own preclinical and clinical studies.

 

20
 


Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product, but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if any of our product candidates is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
 
The FDA also administers a clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may compete for funding to conduct clinical studies to support the approval of drugs, biologics, medical devices and medical foods for rare diseases and conditions. A product does not have to be designated as an orphan product to be eligible for the grant program. An application for an orphan grant should propose one discrete clinical study to facilitate FDA approval of the product for a rare disease or condition. The clinical study may address an unapproved new product or an unapproved new use for a product already on the market.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review on a rolling basis sections of the NDA or BLA before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
 
A fast track product may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A fast track product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a fast track product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well- controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

The FDA Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA includes a provision that allows sponsors to request that their drug be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy. The goal of this program is to expedite the development and review of a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA actions to expedite the development of a Breakthrough Therapy include (a) holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug, (b) providing timely advice to and interactive communication with the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable, (c) involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review, (d) assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor and (e) taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any drug or biological products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record- keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biological products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers of drugs and biological products must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
Drug and biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs or biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug or biological product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
 
Manufacturers of biological products must also report to the FDA any deviations from cGMP that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product; or any unexpected or unforeseeable event that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product. The regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose documentation requirements.
 
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct.
 
The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical studies, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.
 
In addition, from time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.
 
In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
In the European Union, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, which provide, among other things, that no medicinal product may be placed on the market of a European Union member state unless a marketing authorization has been issued by the European Medicines Agency or a national competent authority. European Union member states require regulatory clearance by both the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical study.
 Under the European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases such as neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes and products designated as orphan medicinal products, and optional for those products which are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. The decentralized procedure of approval provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the reference member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials (draft summary of product characteristics, draft labeling and package leaflet) to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 
Reimbursement
 
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, including, at the federal and state level, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. We anticipate third-party payors will provide reimbursement for our product. However, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our product on a competitive and profitable basis.
 
In addition, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the associated reconciliation bill, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revises the definition of “average manufacturer price” for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective. Further, beginning in 2011, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products and biologic agents. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law. Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under a new Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D went into effect on January 1, 2006. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.

 Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
 
There are also laws that govern a company’s eligibility to participate in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. For example, a company may be debarred from participation if it is found to have violated federal anti-kickback laws, which could have a significant effect on a company’s ability to operate its business.
 
The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations, and additional legislative proposals. Indeed, we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. At the present time, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs. However, Congress is considering passing legislation that would lift the ban on federal negotiations. While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably.
 
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. In some countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of marketing approval. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for our product.
