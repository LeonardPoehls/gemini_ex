About this Annual Report 
 On May 3, 2016, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, or the Merger Agreement, by and among Valeritas Holdings, Inc., Valeritas Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Valeritas Holdings, Inc., or the Acquisition Subsidiary, and Valeritas, Inc., Acquisition Subsidiary was merged with and into Valeritas, with Valeritas being the surviving entity and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Valeritas Holdings, Inc., or the 2016 Merger. Immediately prior to the 2016 Merger, all shares of common stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series AA Preferred Stock, and shares underlying common stock options and shares underlying the warrants were canceled without consideration. Concurrent with the 2016 merger, the shares of Valeritas private company Series AB Preferred Stock were canceled and each share of private company Series AB Preferred Stock of Valeritas was replaced with 0.23856 shares of common stock of Valeritas Holdings, Inc. 
 Upon the closing of the Merger, under the terms of a split-off agreement and a general release agreement, Valeritas Holdings, Inc. transferred all of its pre-Merger operating assets and liabilities to its wholly owned special purpose subsidiary, or the Split-Off Subsidiary, and transferred all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Split-Off Subsidiary to the pre-Merger majority stockholder of Valeritas Holdings, Inc., or the Split-Off, in consideration of and in exchange for (i) the surrender and cancellation of 40,486,000 shares of Valeritas Holdings, Inc. common stock held by such stockholder (which will be cancelled and will resume the status of authorized but unissued shares of Valeritas Holdings, Inc. common stock) and (ii) certain representations, covenants and indemnities. 
 The Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger, and Valeritas is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the reverse merger. The historical financial statements of the Valeritas Holding, Inc. prior to the 2016 Merger have been replaced with the historical financial statements of Valeritas. 
 As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates, references to Valeritas, the Company, we, our, us or similar terms refer to Valeritas Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiary Valeritas, Inc. 
 Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage medical technology company focused on improving health and simplifying life for people with diabetes by developing and commercializing innovative technologies. We designed our first commercialized product, the V-Go Wearable Insulin Delivery Device, or V-Go, to help patients with Type 2 diabetes who require insulin to achieve and maintain their target blood glucose goals. V-Go is indicated for continuous subcutaneous infusion of insulin over 24 hours and on-demand bolus dosing in two-unit increments in adult patients requiring insulin. V-Go is a small, discreet and easy-to-use disposable insulin delivery device that a patient adheres to his or her skin every 24 hours. V-Go enables patients to closely mimic the bodys normal physiologic pattern of insulin delivery throughout the day and to manage their diabetes with insulin without the need to plan a daily routine around multiple daily injections. 
 We currently focus on the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetesa pervasive and costly disease that, according to the 2014 National Diabetes Statistics Report released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, currently affects 90% to 95% of the approximately 21 million U.S. adults diagnosed with diabetes. The CDC estimates that the combined direct medical and drug costs and indirect lost productivity costs of diabetes in the United States in 2012 were approximately $245 billion annually. We believe the majority of the 12.6 million U.S. adults treating their Type 2 diabetes with more than one daily oral anti-diabetic drug, or OAD, or an injectable diabetes medicine can benefit from the innovative approach of V-Go to manage Type 2 diabetes.

 Our near-term market consists of approximately 5.6 million of these patients who currently take insulin, of which up to 4.5 million may not be achieving their target blood glucose goal. This patient population represents a $16.5 billion annual U.S. market when applying the annual wholesale acquisition cost, or WAC, of V-Go to the 4.5 million patients not achieving glycemic control. WAC is the gross price paid by wholesalers and does not take into account fees, discounts, and rebates from us. 
 Insulin therapies using syringes, pens and programmable insulin pumps are often burdensome to a Type 2 diabetes patients daily routine, which can lead to poor adherence to prescribed insulin regimens and, as a result, ineffective diabetes management. We developed V-Go utilizing our core technology, the h-Patch platform, as a patient-focused solution to address the challenges of traditional insulin therapies. Our h-Patch platform facilitates the simple and effective subcutaneous delivery of injectable medicines to patients across a broad range of therapeutic areas. V-Go enables patients to closely mimic the bodys normal physiologic pattern of insulin delivery by releasing a single type of insulin at a continuous preset background, or basal, rate over a 24-hour period and on demand around mealtime, or bolus dosing. We believe V-Go is an attractive management tool for patients with Type 2 diabetes requiring insulin because it only requires a single fill of insulin prior to use and provides comprehensive basal-bolus therapy without the burden and inconvenience associated with multiple daily injections. V-Go is available in three different dosages depending on the patients needs and is generally cost competitive for both patients and third-party payors when compared to insulin pens or programmable insulin pumps. 
 V-Go was one of the first insulin delivery device cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, under its Infusion Pump Improvement Initiative, which established additional device manufacturing requirements designed to foster the development of safer, more effective infusion pumps, and is the only FDA-cleared mechanical basal-bolus insulin delivery device on the market in the United States. All other FDA-cleared basal-bolus insulin delivery products currently available in the United States are electronic and are classified as Durable Medical Equipment and, although cleared for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, were designed primarily for patients with Type 1 diabetes. As V-Go is a mechanical device, it does not include any electronics, batteries or audible alarms and does not require any recharging or programming, which allows for simple and discreet use. Unlike electronic insulin delivery devices, V-Go is not classified as durable medical equipment by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, allowing for potential Medicare reimbursement under Medicare Part D. The Medicare Part D outpatient drug benefit defines V-Go and certain other supplies used for injecting insulin as drugs, which allows V-Go to be available for coverage by Part D Plans under Medicare Part D. In addition to Medicare, a majority of commercially insured patients are currently covered for V-Go under their insurance plans. 
 We commenced commercial sales of V-Go in the United States during 2012. During the first half of 2012, we initiated an Early Access Program to provide a limited number of physicians with free V-Go products for patients and began shipments to major wholesalers in anticipation of commercial launch. In the second half of 2012, we began hiring sales representatives in selected U.S. markets. In February 2016, we underwent a reduction-in-force of our sales representatives to focus our resources on prioritized higher-volume territories. At the end of 2016, our sales team, which consisted of 37 sales representatives, covered 37 territories primarily within the East, South, Midwest and Southwest regions of the United States. We currently have 36 sales representatives. 
 Our net loss was $46.4 million and $67.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $424.2 million and $377.9 million, respectively. Based on prescription data, we estimate that there were approximately 89,600 prescriptions reported for V-Go filled during the year ended December 31, 2016. Refill prescriptions account for slightly more than two-thirds of our total prescriptions, and generally move in parallel with our patient retention rates, so can be used as a proxy to determine patient retention. We estimate that as of December 31, 2016, V-Go had been used for over 10 million cumulative patient days with over 10 million V-Gos dispensed to patients.

Market Opportunity 
 Diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease and was reported in 2014 to impact an estimated 422 million people worldwide and is characterized by the bodys inability to properly metabolize glucose. Management of glucose is regulated by insulin, a hormone that allows cells in the body to absorb glucose from blood and convert it into energy. In people without diabetes, the body releases small amounts of insulin regularly over 24 hours and additional amounts of insulin when eating meals. Diabetes is classified into two main types. Type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune response in which the body attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. As a result, the pancreas can no longer produce insulin, requiring patients to administer daily insulin injections to survive. Type 2 diabetes, the more prevalent form of the disease, occurs when either the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the amount of glucose in the blood or cells become resistant to insulin and are unable to use it effectively. Type 1 diabetes is frequently diagnosed during childhood or adolescence, and the onset of Type 2 diabetes generally occurs in adulthood, but its incidence is growing among the younger population primarily due to the increasing incidence of childhood obesity. In addition, other factors commonly thought to be contributing to the prevalence and growth of Type 2 diabetes include aging populations, sedentary lifestyles, worsening diets and increased adult obesity. 
 In 2014, the CDC estimated that 29.1 million people in the United States have diabetes while only 21 million people have been formally diagnosed with the disease by a medical professional. The CDC further estimates that 86 million Americans over the age of 20 had pre-diabetes, which means a higher than normal blood glucose level that, without intervention, is likely to result in Type 2 diabetes within 10 years. In 2010, the prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed patients with diabetes aged 20 to 64 years old was estimated by the CDC to be 20% and 26% in patients over 65 years of age. In 2010, an additional 1.9 million individuals in the United States were diagnosed with diabetes, according to the CDC, a rate that could result in as many as one in every three Americans having diabetes by 2050. The CDC estimated the total cost burden of diagnosed diabetes of both types in the United States in 2012 to be $245 billion annually, which includes direct medical costs of $176 billion. 
 Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease. Data from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study suggest that individuals with Type 2 diabetes lose on average approximately 50% of the function of their beta cells, the cells that produce insulin, prior to diagnosis. If not closely monitored and properly treated, diabetes can lead to serious medical complications. According to the CDC, diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, non-traumatic lower limb amputations and new cases of blindness in the United States. The prevalence of other chronic disorders commonly occurring in patients with Type 2 diabetes, including high blood pressure and high cholesterol, can significantly impact a patients lifestyle given the various daily treatment regimens often used to treat these conditions. Diabetes has a significant impact on overall patient mortality; according to the CDC, the risk for death among people with diabetes is approximately one and a half that of similarly aged people without diabetes. 
 A hemoglobin A1C test, which measures a patients trailing three-month average blood glucose level, or A1C level, is a key indicator of how well a patient is controlling his or her diabetes. Specifically, the A1C test measures the percentage of a patients hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen that is coated with sugar. A higher A1C level correlates with poorer blood sugar control and an increased risk of diabetes complications. The American Diabetes Association, or ADA, recommends an A1C goal of no more than 7% for most patients. 
 Once Type 2 diabetes has been diagnosed, physicians and patients often first seek to manage the disease through meal planning and physical activity before progressing to medications designed to manage A1C levels. Patients often begin medical treatment with a once-daily OAD. If OAD monotherapy does not achieve or maintain the A1C target, combination therapy is recommended, which can include additional oral agents, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist or once-daily, or basal, insulin. If basal insulin has been appropriately titrated and glucose levels remain elevated, advancement to an insulin regimen including additional mealtime insulin, or

 bolus dosing, is a recommended option. Generally, the introduction of insulin occurs within 10 years of diagnosis. 
 The following diagram depicts an illustrative treatment progression of a typical patient with Type 2 diabetes, as well as the number of patients currently in each category according to the 2014 U.S. Roper Diabetes Patient Market Study. 
 Illustrative Type 2 Diabetes Treatment Progression 
 


There are approximately 12.6 million patients with Type 2 diabetes in the United States, of which approximately 5.6 million patients currently inject insulin. Our near-term target market consists of the up to 4.5 million patients in this group who may not be achieving the recommended target blood glucose goal (A1C <7%). Of these patients, nearly 3.0 million have an A1C greater than or equal to 8%. In addition, of the remaining approximately 7.0 million U.S. adults with Type 2 diabetes who do not inject insulin, we believe those who are treating their diabetes with more than one OAD per day and/or an injectable GLP-1 diabetes medicine other than insulin can also benefit from the innovative approach of V-Go to manage Type 2 diabetes. 
 We believe we compete primarily with insulin injections by either insulin pens or insulin syringes. We do not consider insulin pumps as competition because these are electronic devices that are replaced every two to four years based on medical necessity, which we consider common industry practice; have annual medical deductibles and require monthly medical co-insurance due to their classification as durable medical equipment; and, although cleared for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, are designed primarily for patients with Type 1 diabetes. 
 Therapeutic Challenges and Limitations of Current Insulin Delivery Mechanisms 
 Multiple studies indicate that, when taken as prescribed, a basal-bolus insulin regimen is a very effective means for lowering blood glucose levels of patients with Type 2 diabetes because it most closely mimics the bodys normal physiologic pattern of insulin delivery throughout the day: 

 | basal insulin provides approximately 50% of the daily insulin requirementinsulin is released regularly over 24 hours to control blood glucosehowever, this nearly constant rate of insulin release is inadequate to handle post-mealtime glucose excursions (the change in blood glucose concentration from before to after a meal); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | bolus insulin provides the remaining, approximately 50%, of the daily insulin requirement and is released in response to food intake or a meal to control post-mealtime hyperglycemiathe exaggerated rise in blood glucose following a meal.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Patient adherence and compliance with basal-bolus insulin therapy using syringes and/or pens has proven difficult because these therapies require the use of various forms of insulin, including long- and short-acting insulin preparations, and due to the inconvenience to patients, who need to plan a routine around multiple daily injections.

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, a study of patients with Type 1 diabetes conducted by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, or NIDDK, the results of which were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1993, indicated that conventional insulin therapy, defined as one or two insulin injections per day without changing the insulin dose in response to blood glucose levels, is less effective in achieving recommended blood glucose levels over time than intensive insulin therapy in which a patient administers three or more insulin injections per day with varying doses depending upon blood glucose levels. Additionally, the Treating to Target in Type 2 Diabetes study of 708 men and women with suboptimal A1C levels published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2009, found that by three years or study end, 81.6% of patients initiated on a basal insulin-based regimen required the addition of mealtime insulin three times daily. Sixty-three percent of patients in this basal insulin-based subgroup achieved the A1C goal of less than 7% by study end. We believe the outcomes of these studies confirm that an important factor of any insulin therapy is its ability to mimic the bodys normal physiologic pattern of insulin delivery. 
 Challenges Associated with Type 2 Diabetes Management 
 Regardless of the type of insulin therapy, many patients with Type 2 diabetes on insulin fail to reach their A1C goal. Adding mealtime insulin to a basal-only regimen can help, but patient adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen is often a challenge. In a database analysis of 27,897 adult patients prescribed insulin in the United States, the results of which were published in the journal ClinicoEconomics and Outcomes Research in 2013, only 20.4% of patients had reached the ADAs recommended A1C goal of less than 7%. Similarly poor results were observed across each patient group in the study regardless of whether they were prescribed basal-only insulin, basal-bolus insulin or a combination of both long-acting and fast-acting insulin. 
 Patient non-adherence to prescribed insulin therapy is often an important contributing factor in a patients failure to achieve target A1C goals. In a 2012 survey of 1,250 physicians who treat patients with diabetes and 1,530 insulin-treated patients (180 with Type 1 diabetes and 1,350 with Type 2 diabetes) published in Diabetic Medicine, patients reported insulin omission/non-adherence an average of 3.3 days per month. Additionally, 72.5% of physicians in the study reported that a typical patient did not take his or her insulin as prescribed, with an average of 4.3 days per month of non-compliance with a basal insulin regimen and 5.7 days per month of noncompliance with mealtime administration of insulin. Common reasons cited by patients for failing to comply with a prescribed treatment regimen include the burden of multiple daily injections, the potential embarrassment about injecting medication around family and friends or in public, and interference with the patients daily activities and resulting loss of freedom. Similarly, in the 2011 US Roper Diabetes Patient Market Study, or the 2011 Roper Study, of 2,104 patients with diabetes, of which 692 were on insulin, 72% of respondents who had been prescribed to take three or more insulin injections per day did not inject themselves when they were away from home. Failure to comply with prescribed insulin therapy, particularly mealtime insulin therapy, reduces the overall efficacy of insulin treatment in managing Type 2 diabetes. 
Limitations of Current Insulin Therapy 
 OADs are the first line of diabetic therapy for patients with Type 2 diabetes, along with diet and lifestyle changes. However, given that Type 2 diabetes is progressive in nature and that the effectiveness of oral agents and other therapies may decline over time, patients are typically prescribed insulin therapy within 10 years of diagnosis. Depending on the progression of diabetes, there are four primary types of insulin therapy prescribed today for patients with Type 2 diabetes that seek to control or manage their blood glucose levels: 

 | a once-daily dose of basal insulin, typically a long-acting insulin such as Levemir® or Lantus®;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a twice-daily injection regimen comprised of either a daily injection of long-acting basal insulin in addition to a dose of insulin, typically a short- or fast-acting insulin, such as Humalog®, Apidra® or NovoLog®, with the largest meal or two injections of premixed insulin, which combines long-acting and fast-acting formulations within a single insulin dose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5 
 

 | intensive therapy requiring multiple daily injections, or MDI, with syringes or preloaded insulin pens; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion using programmable insulin pumps.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe conventional insulin therapy is among the least expensive insulin-based diabetes treatments and is typically initiated with a once-daily dose of a long-acting insulin. MDI intensive therapy with syringes can be effective and less costly than other therapies. MDI intensive therapy with insulin pens offers a more convenient alternative to syringes but can be more expensive. In addition, programmable insulin pumps offer an effective means of implementing intensive diabetes management with the goal of achieving near-normal blood glucose levels. However, we believe that patient concerns with lifestyle factors, ease of use, convenience and high costs have limited overall adherence to insulin regimens, resulting in a significant number of patients with Type 2 diabetes failing to meet their A1C goals with MDI or the use of programmable insulin pumps. 
 We believe, based on customer feedback and experience, that the current insulin therapies described below present the following advantages and limitations for patients with Type 2 diabetes. 
 

 Basal Insulin 
Description: A once-daily dose of long-acting insulin (such as Lantus® and Levemir®) at bedtime or in the morning, although some patients require two injections (morning and bedtime). 
 Advantages |  Limitations/Challenges 
 Easiest to train, learn and correctly administer insulin as injections and can be performed at home  Least costly analog insulin therapy, which uses genetically altered (or chemically altered) human insulin designed to release injected insulin to more closely mimic human insulin, for patients with most favorable reimbursement coverage  Lowest risk for patient dosing error |  Insulin absorption can have variability from day to day or between different patients such that insulin is not released over the entire intended delivery period  Basal insulin addresses fasting and pre-mealtime glucose levels only, no impact on mealtime glucose excursions  Most patients eventually need mealtime insulin to achieve their A1C goal 
 Basal Insulin + 1 or Premixed Insulin 
Description: Considered a transition regimen towards MDI or intensive therapy typically consisting of a twice-daily injection regimen of either: (i) a daily injection of long-acting insulin (such as Lantus® and Levemir ®) at bedtime (basal) plus an injection of fast acting insulin (such as Humalog® and NovoLog®), before the days largest meal, or basal + 1; or (ii) premixed insulin injections before breakfast and dinner.
 Advantages |  Limitations/Challenges 
 Basal +1 and Premix  Compared to basal only insulin regimens, provides insulin for at least one, or in the case of premix, two of the patients meals |  Basal +1 and Premix  No insulin coverage for at least one meal each day, or in the case of Basal+1, two meals each day 

 
6 
 

 Premix  Injections can normally be performed at home  Single type of insulin used in a single device |  Basal +1  Additional patient co-pay for additional dose of mealtime insulin  Potential for dosing error increased with two types of insulin  Premix  Patients typically use more insulin, may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may gain more weight  Requires planning activities and eating around the timing of injections and absorption of insulin 
 Multiple Daily InjectionsMDI (Intensive Therapy) 
Description: A once- or twice-daily injection of long-acting insulin at bedtime or in the morning (basal rate) plus an injection of fast-acting insulin before meals and, if appropriate, with snacks (bolus dose). 
 Advantages |  Limitations/Challenges 
 With strict adherence, can closely mimic the bodys normal physiologic pattern of insulin release  Allows insulin dosing based on the requirements of individual meals  Lower cost with favorable reimbursement coverage compared to programmable insulin pumps  Easier to teach, learn and correctly administer compared to programmable insulin pumps |  Frequent injections (usually at least four per day)  Requires training around two different types of insulin and the need to carry two types of insulin or insulin pens  Potential for dosing error increased with two types of insulin  Requires significant planning of meals and other activities  Injections often administered outside the home creating adherence challenges especially around meals  Requires two patient co-pays 


 Programmable Insulin Pumps 
Description: A wearable electronic insulin pump filled with a fast-acting insulin that delivers a continuous dose of insulin (basal rate) and the ability to deliver insulin with meals or snacks (bolus dose), based upon programmable settings and patient input. Most pumps require an infusion set to deliver the insulin in addition to the pump.
 Advantages |  Limitations/Challenges 
 When used properly, can most closely mimic the bodys normal physiologic pattern of insulin release  Customized basal and bolus insulin doses  Eliminates the need for daily needle injections |  Most complicated to teach, learn and correctly administer and normally requires a proactive and adherent patient  Bothersome to wear and least discreet alternative 

 
7 
 

 Most significant risk of dosing errors due to the wide range of programmable functions and features  Highest up-front and maintenance cost  Reimbursement coverage for patients with Type 2 diabetes significantly less accessible than for injections 

 Given the reasons cited by patients for non-adherence to and the limitations of currently prescribed insulin therapy, we believe simplicity of insulin delivery contributes to adherence with therapy. In turn, when patients more fully comply with their prescribed treatment regimen, we believe that insulin therapy will be more effective. While insulin syringes, insulin pens and programmable insulin pumps are capable of facilitating basal-bolus therapy, we believe these methods of administration generally lack the simplicity of operation and lifestyle adaptability desired by patients with Type 2 diabetes. We believe that, in general, programmable insulin pump therapies tend to have more advantages for Type 1 patients who may require varying basal rates over a 24-hour period or more complex bolus dosing regimens. These complexities are generally not encountered by patients with Type 2 diabetes. 
 The following diagram demonstrates the benefits of V-Go as compared to other currently available insulin therapies in terms of simplicity of use and ability to mimic the bodys normal physiologic pattern of insulin delivery. We estimate that more than 95% of patients with type 2 diabetes are prescribed a regimen that relies on an insulin pen device or insulin syringe to deliver insulin including basal, basal + 1, premix and intensive therapy or multiple daily injection regimens. 
 


We believe V-Go is appealing to healthcare providers and patients because it combines the benefits of basal-bolus therapy with the convenience of a once-daily injection using just one type of insulin and a smaller amount of it compared to injection. Our internal studies indicate that these characteristics help support patient compliance with basal-bolus regimens, thereby improving glycemic control. We also believe V-Go is an attractive option because it is discreet and simple to operate, yet mimics the bodys normal physiologic pattern of insulin delivery without the inconvenience associated with syringes and pens or the complexities associated with programmable pumps.

Our Solution 
 Simple, Discreet and Effective Type 2 Diabetes Management 
 V-Go fills a critical need of patients with Type 2 diabetes who, we believe, desire and benefit from an easy-to-use, more discreet, basal-bolus insulin regimen. As depicted in the following image, V-Go is designed to be worn on the skin under clothing and measures just 2.4 inches wide by 1.3 inches long by 0.5 inches thick (excluding the adhesive component), weighing approximately one ounce when filled with insulin. 
Specifically Designed for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes 
 Patients with Type 2 diabetes who are prescribed intensive insulin therapy report the burden of multiple injections, embarrassment of injection and interference with daily activities as key factors for non-compliance with insulin therapy. Unlike programmable insulin pumps, V-Go is a 24 hour, disposable mechanical device that operates without electronics, batteries, infusion sets or programming and with fewer injections then using insulin syringes or pens. In the 2011 Roper Study, 72% of patients with Type 2 diabetes prescribed basal-bolus injectable insulin regimens reported not taking injections away from home, making it difficult for many of them to remain in compliance with their prescribed therapy. V-Go was designed to facilitate basal-bolus therapy compliance by removing the complexity and stigma of insulin injections in patients with Type 2 diabetes. In patients we surveyed prior to starting V-Go and again 30 days after being on V-Go, 53% of patients found V-Go very convenient compared to only 10% reporting their prior therapy was very convenient. In this same survey, 64% of patients felt their quality of life, based on how they felt physically or mentally, was generally good to excellent compared to only 35% prior to V-Go.
The following diagram demonstrates the basal and bolus functions of V-Go. The bolus operation can be completed through the patients clothing. 
 


Simple, Effective and Innovative Approach to Insulin-Based Diabetes Management 
 V-Go utilizes our proprietary h-Patch drug delivery technology to enable patients to closely mimic the bodys normal physiologic pattern of insulin delivery by delivering a single type of insulin at a predictable and 
 
9 
 
 continuous preset basal rate over a 24-hour period and providing convenient and discreet on-demand bolus dosing at mealtimes. We believe V-Go is a simple and effective approach to insulin therapy and facilitates patient adherence to basal-bolus insulin regimens, which leads to better patient results. In a series of clinical studies examining patients with diabetes using V-Go, clinically relevant reductions in A1C levels were observed after switching to or initiating V-Go therapy, as well as reductions in the prescribed total daily insulin dose. These findings are summarized in the following charts and are described in more detail under Extensive Clinical Evidence Demonstrating Results.

User-Friendly Design 
 In addition to its small size and dosage versatility, V-Go offers many additional user-friendly features designed to treat and improve the quality of life of patients with Type 2 diabetes requiring insulin, including: 
 

 | using a single fast-acting insulin, such as Humalog® or NovoLog ®, rather than a combination of multiple types or premixed insulin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | not requiring patients to carry syringes, pens or other supplies for mealtime bolus dosing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | offering the convenience of pressing buttons for on-demand bolus dosing through clothing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | allowing patients to easily maintain their daily routines and activities, including showering, exercising and sleeping;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | only requiring application of a new V-Go every 24 hours, which offers patients the flexibility to selectively choose an application site that best suits the days activities; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | not burdening patients with the complexities associated with learning to use an electronic device or programming a pump.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cost Effective for Payor and Patient Alike 
 V-Go is generally a cost competitive option for payors and patients when compared to insulin pens, which is the delivery method prescribed for a majority of all insulin therapies and approximately 66% of newly prescribed basal and mealtime insulin therapies. V-Go is available at retail and mail order pharmacies and is covered by Medicare as well as commercial insurance plans covering a majority of patients. As a result, out-of-pocket costs for covered patients using V-Go are generally equivalent to what they would pay if taking basal-bolus injections with insulin pens or syringes. We believe that, from a payors perspective, using V-Go for insulin delivery will generally be associated with an equal or lower cost, net of rebates and co-pays, to treat a patient compared to the cost of using multiple daily injections to deliver basal-bolus insulin therapy. Moreover, insulin delivery with V-Go is significantly less expensive, especially in the first year, than treatment with programmable insulin pumps. This cost difference in the first year is attributed to the programmable durable medical equipment component associated with electronic insulin pumps that are not needed for V-Go. This durable medical equipment component can have initial costs for the pump and supplies of approximately $5,000 per device. In addition, daily consumables such as tubing and insertion sets are required for electronic pump therapy and not on V-Go.
Another consideration is out-of-pocket costs for patients with different diabetes regimens. Pharmacy formularies are separated into multiple tiers, of which Tier 2 and Tier 3 are most applicable to the V-Go. Tier 1 products are the lowest cost tier of prescription products, which mainly consists of generic drugs; Tier 2 products are generally preferred brand name products, for which co-pays are more than Tier 1; and Tier 3 consists mainly of non-preferred brand name products, which are more expensive than Tier 2. We believe that patient costs can be neutral when switching from basal-bolus insulin pen therapy to V-Go therapy. As every payor and every employer plan within a payor has their own co-pay structure, we reached this conclusion by utilizing national averages provided by a national employer health benefits survey conducted in 2014 by Kaiser Permanente to make comparisons. We estimated co-pays for insulin pens and pen needles to be $73 per month, which assumes national Tier 2 co-pay equal to $31 for each pen box and $11 for pen needles. The V-Go co-pay can be $31 for Tier 2 or $53 for Tier 3 for a month supply, depending on which formulary Tier it is assigned to . Insulin vials for V-Go would be similar to insulin pens at $31 per month. Therefore, expected monthly co-pay for V-Go can be $62 when in Tier 2 or $84 when in Tier 3, which is essentially cost neutral to patients.

 The majority of patients using V-Go are trained to use the device by their healthcare provider or a Certified Diabetes Educator, or CDE, who has been trained by our sales force using a train the trainer approach. Our 
 
11 
 
 sales force has the ability to train patients directly and also trains physicians, physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, CDEs and any other staff in a healthcare providers office, who are responsible for training their patients to properly use V-Go. Additionally, we provide a starter kit for new V-Go patients, which contains all the materials a patient needs to deliver basal-bolus insulin therapy with V-Go. We also offer supplemental training support and resources when healthcare providers or patients need additional V-Go training assistance, including online resources such as a learning management system and online videos. 
 Our V-Go Customer Care Center, or VCC, is a live customer care center operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The VCC provides broad-based V-Go operational assistance to healthcare providers, patients, caregivers and pharmacists. Every patient is encouraged to call the VCC in order to opt-in for support and, once a patient does opt- in, a VCC staff-member proactively contacts the patient at various times to provide additional patient support and promote proper use of V-Go. VCC representatives can also train patients on the operational aspects of V-Go either via phone or video. The VCC also offers a reimbursement support service to answer patients reimbursement-related questions. 
 Extensive Clinical Evidence Demonstrating Results 
 The V-Go solution to Type 2 diabetes management is focused both on A1C management and on providing patients the requisite support to achieve their goal of improved health. We and others have conducted several studies, analyses and research surveys to evaluate the role of V-Go in A1C management. These studies include a prospective observational study, user preference studies, retrospective analyses of diabetic patients electronic medical records and patient and physician surveys. The results of these studies and analyses are described below. 
User Preference Program 
 In 2008, we conducted a user preference program, or UPP, designed to gain feedback about V-Go. We surveyed 10 healthcare professionals and 31 patients to determine their impressions about usability, convenience, comfort, educational materials and effectiveness of V-Go. Patients were asked to rate, on a 10-point scale, their overall experience as well as their impressions of various parameters associated with V-Go, such as ease of use, how discreet it was, how comfortable the device was to wear, whether they would recommend V-Go to a friend or family member and how helpful our patient education teams were. For each measure evaluated, V-Go received an average score of between 8.7 and 9.4 on a 10-point scale, which we consider to be highly positive. We also surveyed patients about their adherence to V-Go therapy as part of the UPP and found a patient-reported adherence rate of 98%. 
 To obtain information on the efficacy of V-Go in helping to manage blood glucose control, we performed a retrospective analysis of 23 of the patients who participated in the UPP, of which 22 had Type 2 diabetes and one had Type 1 diabetes, the results of which were published in the journal Endocrine Practice in 2012. Data was collected before V-Go initiation, after 12 weeks of V-Go use, at the end of V-Go treatment and 12 weeks after discontinuing V-Go. After 12 weeks of V-Go use, compared to before V-Go initiation, the average A1C level improved from 8.8% to 7.6%, with a p-value of 0.005, and patients reported using an average of 13% less daily insulin not tested for statistical significance) from a baseline of 49 units per day. Once they stopped using V-Go and were switched to other diabetes therapies, their average A1C level rebounded to 8.2%, with a p-value of 0.011, and their average daily insulin dose increased (not tested for statistical significance). An experimental result, such as those derived from a clinical or non-clinical study is statistically significant if it is unlikely to have occurred by chance. The statistical significance of experimental results is determined by a widely used statistical method that establishes the p-value of the results, which is a statistical measure of the probability that the difference in results between treatment and control groups in a study could have occurred by chance. Under this method, the smaller the p-value the greater the confidence that the results are significant, and a p-value of less than .05, reflecting a less than one-in-twenty probability that the result occurred by chance, is generally considered by the FDA to represent statistical significance. The UPP was not a clinical trial, but it did represent real world experiences with the V-Go.

12 
 
V-Go was generally well tolerated during the UPP. The average body weight of patients was steady through use of V-Go and increased slightly after treatment cessation. Two instances of low blood glucose, or hypoglycemia, were reported during the UPP, of which one met the defined criteria for a serious adverse event. No other serious adverse events were observed during V-Go use based on the retrospective analysis. A total of seven patients in the retrospective analysis reported at least one application site reaction, such as irritation, redness, rash, itching, tenderness or discomfort, while only one patient reported pain at the injection site. 
 This analysis suggested that average A1C improved when insulin was delivered using V-Go. The investigators suggested that a possible reason for the improvements in blood glucose levels was due to better patient adherence with this insulin regimen due to the simplicity of V-Go.
The SIMPLE Study 
 We conducted a multicenter prospective clinical trial of 89 patients to evaluate the effectiveness of V-Go for patients with diabetes in a real-world setting. Findings from this study have been presented in past years at the American Diabetes Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Annual Scientific Congresses. The primary objective was to compare changes of average glycemic control as measured by A1C from baseline to the end of V-Go use. Patients with Type 2 diabetes who were administering one or more insulin injections per day and not meeting target A1C control of less than 7% were included in the study. The patient types included in this trial were: 

 | Basal: Patients receiving once or twice daily injections of an intermediate- or long-acting insulin regardless of oral anti-diabetes medication use (26 patients).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Premix: Patients receiving one to three daily injections of premix insulin regardless of oral anti-diabetes medication use (13 patients).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | MDI: Patients receiving any insulin therapy with three or more insulin injections a day regardless of oral anti-diabetes medication use (47 patients).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Other: Patients receiving OADs only and patients receiving OADs plus non-insulin injectable (3 patients).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A1C levels in the overall population (n=89) decreased from 8.8% at baseline to 8.1% at month three, representing a statistically significant reduction of 0.7% with a p-value less than 0.0001. 
 When classifying the data by subgroups, both the basal and MDI subgroups demonstrated statistically significant A1C reductions from baseline (basal -0.76%, p=0.0003; Premix -0.66%, p=0.3006; MDI -0.66%, p=0.0002). A nine-month interim analysis in 59 patients from the basal subgroup with a baseline A1C of 8.7% demonstrated a progressive and statistically significant A1C improvement at three, six and nine months (p<0.001 compared to baseline at all the time points). A1C reduction at nine months was 1.0% from baseline in this subgroup. In addition to the significant improvements in blood glucose, the average daily dose of insulin across all patients was also reduced by 18% (62.4 to 51.0 units, p=0.001) from baseline. A small but statistically significant decrease in body weight (-0.71 lbs., p<0.0001) was observed, although not clinically meaningful given the baseline weight of the patient population. Overall, the incidence of hypoglycemia after three months of V-Go use was low, with 90% of patients reporting no hypoglycemia. 
 The Diabetes America Study: Use of V-Go in Patients with Sub-Optimally Controlled Diabetes 
 Diabetes America, a group of 13 specialized diabetes care clinics located across the major metropolitan areas of Texas, conducted a study to evaluate the effect of switching patients with sub-optimally controlled diabetes to V-Go. The only funding provided by us for this study was to cover the expense for an independent review board to review the study protocol in request of a waiver of patient consent due to the retrospective nature of the study. Data from this study were disclosed in presentations at the American Association of Clinical 
 
13 
 
 Endocrinologists 24th Annual Scientific and Clinical Congress, the 75th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association and the 15th Annual Diabetes and Technology Meeting, as well as being published in four peer reviewed journals. The study was conducted as a retrospective review using data from electronic medical records of patients treated at the various Diabetes America treatment facilities. Patients treated at these facilities were prescribed V-Go by health care providers with the goal of improving A1C levels. The study evaluated the change in A1C from baseline in addition to changes in daily insulin dose, body weight and hypoglycemic events. 
 Patients diagnosed with diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, or Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults, or LADA) at least 21 years old with an A1C between 7% and 14% were switched to V-Go. The overall analysis, as published in the journal Diabetes Therapy in 2015, included 204 patients. Twenty-four of these patients had not used insulin at baseline and the remainder were already prescribed insulin at baseline. Of the patients, 175 were diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and 29 were diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes or LADA. The average time from starting V-Go to the first follow-up visit was 14 weeks and the average time to the second follow-up visit was 27 weeks. 
 The A1C change for the overall patient population and by patient type of diabetes were evaluated and, as summarized in the graphs below, there was a statistically significant improvement in A1C at 14 and 27 weeks after switching to V-Go across all patient types.

* | denotes a p-value less than 0.001.
----+-----------------------------------

 Within the overall group, A1C was statistically significantly reduced by 1.5% (p < 0.001) at 14 weeks and by 1.8% (p<0.001) at 27 weeks. In patients with Type 2 diabetes, statistically significant reductions in A1C of 1.6% (p<0.001) at 14 weeks and 1.8% (p<0.001) at 27 weeks were observed. For patients with Type 1 diabetes or LADA, statistically significant reductions in A1C of 1.0%( p<0.0001) at 14 weeks and 1.5%( p<0.001) at 27 weeks were also observed. When combining the data for all 180 patients prescribed insulin at baseline there were statistically significant reductions in A1C of 1.3% (p<0.001) at 14 weeks and 1.6% (p<0.001) at 27 weeks. Patients naïve to insulin with a baseline of 11.3%, experienced the most substantial decrease in A1C after initiating V-Go with statistically significant reductions in A1C of 3.0% (p<0.001) at 14 weeks and 3.4% (p<0.001) at 27 weeks. 
 An analysis of the overall dataset evaluating changes in A1C based on baseline insulin regimen was published in the journal Practical Diabetology in 2016. The findings in this analysis showed that the 70 patients previously administering MDI therapy at baseline had a statistically significant reduction in A1C of 1.2% (p<0.0001) from a 
 
14 
 
 mean baseline A1C of 9.3% after 27 weeks while the 47 patients previously administering basal insulin at baseline had a statistically significant reduction in A1C of 2.0% (p<0.0001) from a mean baseline A1C of 9.5%. 
 In addition to the A1C improvements, there were also statistically significant reductions in the daily insulin requirements for patients receiving V-Go. At 27 weeks, for patients previously prescribed insulin, the total daily insulin dose was significantly lower (33% to 41%, p<0.001) than the prescribed baseline insulin mean dose ranges (86 units per day as the lower range to 99 units per day as the upper range) prior to switching to V-Go. Basal insulin rates were significantly lower (39% to 46%, p<0.001) than the prescribed baseline insulin dose range. The average daily insulin dose administered with V-Go at week 27 was 0.6 units per kilogram per day. Patients naïve to insulin at baseline, administered an average of 54 units per day (p<0.0001) at 27 weeks on V-Go.
A subset analysis of the data from the Diabetes America study was performed by Diabetes America to evaluate insulin dose changes in patients receiving moderate and higher baseline insulin doses. The aim of this analysis presented at the 2015 Diabetes Technology Meeting was to evaluate the clinical impact of the baseline insulin total daily dose when switching to insulin delivery with V-Go from subcutaneous insulin injections. One hundred four total patients were evaluated who were prescribed moderate baseline insulin doses (less than 100 units per day) before V-Go or high baseline insulin doses (greater than or equal to 100 units per day) before V-Go. Statistically significant improvements in A1C and decreased insulin requirements were observed after an average of six months using V-Go for insulin delivery in patients whose hyperglycemic levels were previously not controlled despite the administration of insulin injections. As shown in the graph below, both arms regardless of baseline insulin dose (moderate or high) observed statistically significant A1C reductions (1.5%, p<0.001 and 1.7%, p<0.0001, respectively). Furthermore, despite significant differences in baseline insulin doses before V-Go, both groups observed statistically significant insulin reductions (p<0.05) and administered similar total daily insulin doses of 0.6 units per kilogram after switching to V-Go, equating to 54 units per day and 67 units per day for the moderate and high insulin dose groups from baseline insulin doses of 62 units per day and 143 units per day, respectively. These results are illustrated in the following graphs. 
 


Across the entire study population for Diabetes America, there was a statistically significant but minor change in body weight of approximately 1.5 kg (p<0.001) after switching to V-Go. Hypoglycemia during V-Go use was similar to that experienced with the previous baseline therapies. Of the 204 subjects included in the study, 32 discontinued use of V-Go after an average of 6 months for reasons including skin irritation, cost and/or lack of adequate insurance coverage, transitioned to traditional pump, weight gain, did not prefer V-Go, pain, GI effect, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and lack of adherence to skin.

Diabetes America Comparative Study; Clinical and Cost Effectiveness of Insulin Delivery with V-Go Wearable Insulin Delivery Device versus Multiple Daily Injections in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Basal Insulin 
 The objective of this study conducted by Diabetes America was to compare two methods of delivering intensified insulin therapy, or IIT, in patients with Type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on basal insulin with or without concomitant antihyperglycemic agents in a real-world clinical setting. A retrospective analysis was conducted utilizing the electronic medical records from Diabetes America. The only funding provided by us for this study was to cover the expense for an independent review board to review the study protocol in request of a waiver of patient consent due to the retrospective nature of the study. 116 patients were evaluated, 56 patients utilizing V-Go and 60 patients utilizing MDI. At 27 weeks, both groups experienced statistically significant improvements in A1C from baseline. By week 27, A1C decreased from 9.5% to 7.6% (p<0.001) with V-Go and decreased from 9.4% to 8.1% (p<0.001) with MDI. A statistically significant treatment difference between the groups was observed of 0.64% (p<0.0201) in favor of V-Go based on the statistical analysis. On average, there was a statistically significant difference in insulin dose between the two groups at 27 weeks. Patients using V-Go administered 28% less insulin compared to patients using MDI, (56 versus 78 units per day, p<0.0001). 
 Total direct pharmacy costs pertaining to diabetes therapeutic agents before and with IIT were calculated. Insulin costs included both the insulin and associated delivery method. All costs were normalized based on a 30-day supply. Non-branded concomitant antihyperglycemic agents were not included in total therapeutic costs. Pricing was based on published wholesale acquisition costs as of September 1, 2015. In this analysis, monthly diabetes-related direct pharmacy costs were $55.70 per patient less with V-Go compared to MDI. 
 When evaluating the cost-effectiveness of both insulin delivery methods by dividing the cost difference from baseline in total monthly direct pharmacy costs for all diabetes agents at 27 weeks by the A1C reduction, the monthly per patient cost per 1% reduction in A1C was statistically significantly less with V-Go compared to MDI ($118.84 compared to $217.16 per patient per month, p<0.013), as illustrated in the graph below. These results were published in 2016 in Endocrine Practice, the journal of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. 
 V-Go Reduced Monthly Direct Pharmacy Costs by 45% per 1% Reduction in A1C

Early Access Program 
 We provided V-Go therapy to patients as part of an early access research survey and the results of this survey were published in Practical Diabetology in 2013. In this survey, clinicians provided detailed treatment histories for the patients who had access to receive treatment with V-Go. After initiating V-Go, the average A1C decreased from 9.3% before V-Go to 7.4% after V-Go initiation, representing a 1.9% improvement (not tested for statistical significance). Clinicians who participated in this survey also reported a 22% reduction in daily basal insulin dose (not tested for statistical significance) in patients receiving V-Go.Northeast Florida Endocrine and Diabetes Associates (NEFEDA) 
 In 2015, we provided an educational grant to a large specialty clinical practice in Northeast Florida to conduct a retrospective analysis to evaluate the impact on glycemic control of switching to V-Go for patients with diabetes that were sub-optimally controlled. Ninety-five patients were evaluated with one follow-up visit, 83 patients with two follow-up visits, and 68 patients had a third visit in this cross sectional analysis after initiating V-Go. Duration of V-Go use was approximately two, five and nine months for the first, second and third follow-up visits. The baseline A1C was 9.7%. Statistically significant A1C reductions from baselines were seen at each of the three follow-up office visits. After five months of V-Go use, a reduction in A1C of 1.6% (p<0.001) was observed. For the 65 patients previously administering insulin at baseline, a substantial reduction in total daily insulin from baseline was also observed at all three follow-up visits. Insulin was reduced from 86 to 67 units/day (p<0.001) in the 65 patients administering insulin at baseline after five months of V-Go use based on insulin doses. There was no change in the incidence of hypoglycemia reported compared to baseline. These results were published and presented at the 76th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in June 2016. 
 The University of Massachusetts Clinical Evaluation 
 In 2013, researchers at the University of Massachusetts examined 21 patients with Type 2 diabetes who lacked glycemic control and switched from MDI therapy to V-Go. The clinical evaluation observed that, after 88 days of V-Go use, based on data from 14 of the 21 patients observed, A1C levels decreased from 10.7% to 8.3% (p<0.001) and total daily doses of insulin decreased by 46% from 119 units to 64 units (p=0.01). These results were also published and presented at the 73rd Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in June 2013. We did not commission nor sponsor this study. 
The Jones Center for Diabetes & Endocrine Wellness Clinical Evaluation 
 We conducted a retrospective clinical analysis to evaluate the clinical experience with V-Go in 91 patients treated at the Jones Center for Diabetes and Endocrine Wellness, a specialized diabetes care clinic. Using electronic medical records, clinical data was collected at V-Go initiation and up to one year of follow-up. Prior to V-Go initiation, 39.6% of patients were prescribed only insulin and 58.2% were prescribed combination therapy that included insulin. Of the 86 patients with type 2 diabetes, 69 patients, or 80%, had at least one follow-up visit. Mean baseline A1C in this group was 9.1% at baseline and 8.3% at follow-up for an average improvement in A1C of 0.8% (not tested for statistical significance). The mean total daily dose of insulin at baseline was 76 units and decreased to 61 units, a 20% (not tested for statistical significance) reduction, on V-Go. These results were also published and presented in the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology. We did not commission the Jones Center to conduct this study. 
 Clinical Evidence Summaries 
 Across these multiple peer-reviewed and published clinical trials, analyses and surveys using both prospective and retrospective study designs, switching patients who had suboptimal glycemic control to V-Go for insulin delivery resulted in statistically significant improvements in A1C, with A1C reductions ranging from 0.7% to 3.4%, depending on the patient population. Moreover, across this body of evidence, switching patients who had 
 
17 
 
 suboptimal glycemic control to V-Go for insulin delivery resulted in with less insulin being used. Daily insulin dose reductions ranged from 13% to 46%, depending on the study and influenced by the amount of insulin patients were prescribed prior to using V-Go. Currently, clinical evidence in support of V-Go has been disclosed across 11 publications and 37 poster presentations and represents clinical experience in approximately 750 patients with diabetes. 
 Our Current and Future Products 
 We believe our technologies represent a fundamentally different approach to basal-bolus insulin delivery. To facilitate therapy compliance, we have sought to eliminate the need for complex electronics and software by utilizing mechanical technology that delivers prescribed dosages of insulin and other injectable drugs with great accuracy without any electronics, batteries, recharging or programming. 
 V-Go Wearable Insulin Delivery Device 
 V-Go is a disposable insulin delivery device for basal-bolus therapy that deploys our innovative proprietary h-Patch technology. Unlike programmable insulin pumps, V-Go is a small, discreet, daily-disposable insulin delivery device that operates without electronics, batteries, infusion sets or programming. V-Go measures just 2.4 inches wide by 1.3 inches long by 0.5 inches thick and weighs approximately one ounce when filled with insulin. 
 V-Go enables patients to closely mimic the bodys normal physiologic pattern of insulin delivery by delivering a single type of insulin at a continuous preset basal rate over a 24-hour period and also providing for on-demand bolus dosing at mealtimes, without the need for electronics or programming. A patient adheres V-Go to his or her skin and presses a button that inserts a small needle that commences a continuous preset basal rate of insulin. At mealtimes, a patient can discreetly press the bolus ready and bolus delivery buttons to deliver insulin on-demand at meals. 
 Each day prior to applying V-Go, a patient fills it with insulin using a filling accessory known as EZ Fill, which is included with each monthly supply of V-Go. V-Go uses a single type of fast-acting insulin, such as Humalog® or NovoLog®, and is available in a preset basal rate to continuously deliver 20, 30 or 40 units of insulin in one 24-hour period (0.83, 1.25 or 1.67 units per hour, respectively) and on-demand bolus dosing in two unit increments (up to 36 units per 24-hour time period). Our proprietary Floating Needle is deployed with the press of a button after V-Go is applied to the skin making the connection between the insulin reservoir and the patients tissue. The Floating Needle then pivots with the bodys natural movements, allowing for maximum comfort. After 24 hours of use, a patient presses a button that retracts the needle and then removes V-Go from the skin, discards V-Go in regular trash and replaces it with a new insulin-filled V-Go for the next 24 hours. The EZ fill device makes the filling process simple and does not require calculations, measuring or needles. The use of the EZ fill device can also prevent accidental needle sticks that occur with pen needles or syringes. 
 h-Patch Controlled Delivery Technology Platform 
 Our proprietary hydraulic h-Patch drug delivery core technology, which is a critical component of V-Go, facilitates the simple and effective delivery of injectable medicines to patients across a broad range of therapeutic areas. The deployment of our h-Patch technology results in a device specifically designed for patients with Type 2 diabetes who, we believe, do not require complex and costly programmable insulin pumps generally designed to meet the needs of Type 1 patients. 
 The hydraulic approach of our h-Patch technology can be used to deliver constant basal or on-demand bolus dosing of any drug than can be delivered subcutaneously. We believe it combines the user advantages of transdermal patches with the accuracy and flexibility of conventional electronic pumps. Once activated, our h-Patch system places a custom-formulated viscous fluid under pressure, which is separately compartmentalized 
 
18 
 
 and therefore designed not to come into contact with the active drug. Once pressurized, the fluid is forced through a flow restrictor that is designed to control the flow rate. After passing through the flow restrictor, the viscous fluid couples with and moves a piston in a cartridge that contains active drug. The viscous fluid continually pushes the piston, dispensing the drug at the prescribed preset basal rate through a needle into the patients subcutaneous tissue. Bolus delivery on demand is similarly driven by viscous fluid dispensed from a separate side chamber, which allows a patient to dispense active drug in two unit increments through a user-activated bolus button. Our h-Patch basal drug delivery technology results in a simple, yet innovative, device that operates without complex controls or an infusion set. 
 The operation of our h-Patch technology is depicted in the graphic below: 
 h-Patch Controlled Delivery Technology 
 


We will continue to explore the use of our h-Patch technology in other drug delivery applications beyond the use of insulin to treat Type 2 diabetes. We believe it has the potential to improve the utility of a variety of drugs that require frequent and cumbersome dosing regimens. 
 Next-Generation V-Go: V-Go Prefill & V-Go Link. 
 We are developing a next-generation, single-use disposable V-Go device that will feature a separate prefilled insulin cartridge that can be snapped by the patient into V-Go. While the current V-Go simplifies the use of insulin for patients with Type 2 diabetes, we believe that a pre-filled V-Go will make insulin therapy even simpler by eliminating the device-filling process by the patient and the need for EZ fill refrigeration, which we expect could further promote adoption by patients with Type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we believe V-Go Prefill could lower the number of co-pays because the insulin and V-Go would be packaged together, generate revenue from the sale of insulin and extend the patent life to 2032. A pre-filled V-Go would also enable V-Go usage for other injectable therapeutic drugs beyond insulin that are used by patients who could benefit from simple, convenient and continuous drug delivery. Currently, the V-Go Prefill is in the design-development stage, with a focus on ease of customer use and optimization of manufacturing efficiency. 
 We are in the early stages of developing V-Go Link, which we intend to feature one-way communication to glucose meters and smart devices such as phones and tablets through RF/Bluetooth technology. We intend V-Go Link to provide real-time tracking information of basal and bolus dosing utilization, allowing patients and their healthcare professionals to have a deeper understanding of their current dosing habits. We believe access to this technology could increase patient adherence and could be used as a diagnostic tool to make treatment adjustments.

Non-Core Technologies 
 We are actively seeking to sell our two non-core technologies, the Mini-Ject Needle Free Technology and the Micro-Trans Microneedle Array Patch Technology. We do not anticipate receiving a material amount of proceeds from the sale of these assets. 
 Mini-Ject Needle-Free Technology 
 Mini-Ject is a fully disposable needle-free injection system that offers a variety of pre-filled options and comfortable administration within a patient-friendly, easy-to-use design. Mini-Ject can deliver a wide range of drugs, from small molecules to large proteins as well as antibodies and vaccines. Our Mini-Ject system has been cleared by the FDA under Section 510(k). 
 Micro-Trans Microneedle Array Patch Technology 
 We have also developed our Micro-Trans microneedle array patch technology to deliver drugs into the dermis layer of the skin. Each Micro-Trans patch consists of multiple small, solid needles constructed with metal or biodegradable polymers and fabricated on a single surface. The patches can be manufactured in various lengths, diameters, wall thicknesses and shapes and can be used to deliver drugs without regard to drug size, structure or a patients skin characteristics. Micro-Trans patches are designed to penetrate only the shallow layers of the skin, avoiding close proximity to pain receptors. We believe this characteristic makes the Micro-Trans patch comfortable for a patient to wear. We have not commercialized a device with this technology and it has not received regulatory approval. 
Our Strategy 
 Our long term goal is to significantly expand and further penetrate the Type 2 diabetes market and become a leading provider of simple-to-use insulin delivery devices designed for basal-bolus insulin therapy. 
 In 2016, we made a significant adjustment in our commercialization strategy by shifting from aggressively expanding sales representative headcount to focusing on fewer highvolume insulin prescribers and on maximizing our sales and marketing infrastructures frequency of interactions and contact points and methods with high-prescribing physicians. We estimate our current sales force structure can directly focus on approximately 1,000 prescribers. This restructuring reduced our monthly cash burn rate significantly and resulted in a business plan that is more capital efficient. Specifically, we reduced headcount and expenses and reduced the number of sales territories staffed by field sales professionals to 28 while at the same time increasing the level of resources in each of these prioritized markets to drive demand. 
 We have learned that, in the competitive Type 2 diabetes market, those prescribers of diabetes products who had more contacts with our sales representatives and marketing programs, both directly and indirectly, remember and prescribe V-Go to more patients, and more appropriate patients, and we believe that, under our prior sales and marketing model, we had diluted our resources across too many sales territories. By focusing on fewer and prioritized markets, while increasing the contacts each healthcare professional has through supplemental inside sales team, an inside peer to peer clinical sales team and through other marketing resources, we can be more competitive in those markets. 
 
20 
 
Our short-term business strategies include the following: 
 


We intend to focus the majority of our resources towards the prioritized markets through the use of sales professionals, inside sales, peer-to-peer programs, targeted direct-to-patient promotions, customer care and additional multi-channel promotional services. Some examples of multi-channel promotion include direct mail, search engine optimization, peer-to-peer email, and other forms of advertising. We intend to optimize our customer acquisition, conversion and retention programs by focusing all our resources. We believe this should allow us to significantly increase our promotional efforts on a per-territory basis, which will allow us to grow these markets. In addition, we plan to improve on and leverage our patient programs such as V-Go life, patient forums, enhanced starter kits and in-office material and promotion, such as context media to empower patients to ask for V-Go as an option for their diabetes treatment. 
 We intend to drive V-Go sales growth by: 
 

 | Leveraging the clinical and economic data that has been published in the last year, including several recent manuscripts, with healthcare professionals and payors. We believe this new data will help more prescribers see the value and understand the benefits or V-Go across a wider spectrum of patients.

 | Expanding third-party reimbursement for V-Go in the United States. We intend to expand patient coverage of V-Go by commercial insurance plans as a pharmacy benefit rather than a medical benefit. We believe that more than 70% of the approximate 158 million commercially insured lives in the United States and 60% of the approximate 43.5 million lives insured by Medicare Part D cover V-Go. In addition, TRICARE, a health care program of the United States Department of Defense Military Health System, covers V-Go as a pharmacy benefit and some State Medicaid plans cover V-Go as a pharmacy or medical benefit. We also offer reimbursement support services to assist patients in gaining access to V-Go throughout the reimbursement process.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Pursing our new business model. We intend to increase use and grow V-Go share by initially targeting approximately 30 doctors per sales representative and increasing to approximately 50 potential targets. We will either add new territories or split existing territories when adding new sales reps. We will expand our direct sales reach to approximately 300 additional prescribers so that we can provide the same higher level of inside sales, clinical sales and promotion as we provide our current prioritized markets. We believe we can grow these markets more quickly than our territories have grown in the past, since they will have significantly more support with our new strategy.

Our long-term business strategies include the following. 
 

 | Continue to expand our U.S. sales force in a capital efficient and disciplined manner utilizing our new business model. We intend to eventually establish a national sales force, internally or through other means, such as contract sales organization, co-promotion or other strategic relationships to ensure we can reach all the very high volume prescribers or explore other means to increase the number of prescribers we can reach.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continue to explore international expansion. We intend to continue exploring international expansion through strategic collaborations, in-licensing arrangements or alliances outside the United States which not only would provide a revenue stream, but would also increase our production volume thereby improving our gross margins in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Capture Improved Economics Through the Commercialization of V-Go Prefill. We are developing and intend to commercialize our V-Go Prefill product, if it is approved by the FDA, which we believe would offer patients an even more simplified user experience, thereby increasing our target market to include patients with Type 2 diabetes not currently on insulin. In addition, we expect to have additional opportunities to generate revenue through the sale of insulin in connection with V-Go Prefill. We believe a prefilled option would also lay the foundation for using our proprietary h-Patch technology with other injectable therapies where patients could benefit from simple, convenient and continuous drug delivery.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Advance our V-Go Link next generation technology, which will feature one-way communication to smart devices such as phones and tablets through RF/Bluetooth technology. V-Go Link will provide real-time tracking information of basal and bolus dosing utilization, allowing patients and their healthcare professionals to have a deeper understanding of their current dosing habits.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Advance our Proprietary h-patch Drug Delivery Technologies into Other Therapeutic Areas. We have built a significant portfolio of proprietary technologies, designed to simply and effectively deliver injectable medicines to patients across a broad range of therapeutic areas. We intend to continue to advance these technologies, either by working with third parties to incorporate them into existing commercial products or by licensing the rights to them to third parties for further development and commercialization.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Leverage Our Scalable Manufacturing Operations to Increase Gross Margin. We intend to leverage our scalable and flexible manufacturing infrastructure and related operational efficiencies to increase our gross margin by reducing our product costs. We believe the existing production lines of our contract manufacturer, or CMO, will have the ability to meet our current and expected near-term V-Go demand. Our CMO also has the ability to replicate additional production lines within its current facility footprint. In addition, we believe that due to shared product design features with V-Go, our production processes are readily adaptable to the manufacture of new products, including a prefilled V-Go.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 Currently, our sales team covers 33 territories primarily within the East, South, and Midwest regions of the United States. We also have a team of inside sales representatives to take incoming calls from interested healthcare professionals as well as a targeted list of V-Go prescribers around the country. To date, we have focused our sales and marketing efforts in the regions where we have the greatest reimbursement coverage for patients. According to Symphony Health Solutions, there are approximately 16,000 high-volume insulin prescribers in the United States, generating 40% of all U.S. annual insulin prescriptions. Our sales representatives call on approximately 1,000 of these targeted, high-volume insulin prescribers, which include endocrinologists and primary care physicians. Our sales team has been supplemented by our V-Go Customer Care Center that provides support to customers and healthcare providers. 
 V-Go is distributed primarily through retail pharmacies and, to a lesser extent, medical supply companies. Similar to a pharmaceutical company, our overall distribution strategy focuses on making V-Go available at retail 
 
22 
 
 and mail-order pharmacies. We have adopted this strategy because patients with Type 2 diabetes frequently visit their local retail pharmacies to fill other prescriptions prescribed for their other chronic conditions. We have distribution agreements with all of the national and many regional wholesalers, as well as with important medical supply companies. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the wholesale distributors McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation represented 35%, 25% and 31%, respectively, of our total product shipments. Our agreements with our distributors allow a patient whose insurance covers V-Go as either a pharmacy benefit or a medical benefit to be able to fill his or her V-Go prescription conveniently. Our agreements with each of Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation are each on a one-year continuous renewal basis unless otherwise terminated by either party. Our agreement with McKesson Corporation has an indefinite term unless otherwise terminated by either party. 
 A patient using V-Go requires two separate prescriptions, one for V-Go itself and one for fast-acting insulin, such as Humalog® or NovoLog®, in vials. As V-Go is only available by prescription, we believe that educating physicians and other healthcare providers regarding the benefits of V-Go is an important step in promoting its patient acceptance. In addition to calling on healthcare providers, our marketing initiatives include presentations and product demonstrations at local, regional and national tradeshows, including ADA Scientific Sessions and the American Association of Diabetes Educators Annual Meeting. 
 Reimbursement 
 In contrast to all other basal-bolus insulin delivery devices currently on the market in the United States, V-Go is not classified as a durable medical device, thereby allowing for potential Medicare reimbursement under Medicare Part D. As a result, a patient with Medicare, whose Medicare Part D Plan chooses to cover V-Go, can fill his or her V-Go prescription at a retail pharmacy that participates in the plan. Even for those Medicare patients whose Medicare Part D Plan elects not to cover V-Go on formulary, those patients may still get V-Go at the pharmacy if the patients Medicare Part D Plan determines that other products currently on formulary are not medically appropriate upon an the patient making an appeal to the patients Medicare Part D Plan regarding V-Go coverage. In addition to the 60% of patients insured by Medicare who have V-Go covered under their plans, a majority of commercially insured patients currently are covered for V-Go under their plans as either a pharmacy benefit or a medical benefit. For the year ended December 31, 2016, over 90% of our V-Go prescriptions were filled by retail or mail order pharmacies with the remainder filled by medical supply companies. 
 Manufacturing and Quality Assurance 
 We currently manufacture V-Go and EZ Fill in clean rooms at our CMO in Southern China in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. Our CMO uses Valeritas-owned custom-designed, semi-automated manufacturing equipment and production lines to meet our quality requirements. Separate CMOs in Southern China perform release testing, sterilization, inspection and packaging functions. 
 V-Go is produced on flexible semi-automated production lines. In 2016, our CMO operated two manufacturing lines producing 3.0 million V-Go units. We have two additional lines outfitted at our CMO on standby that can be quickly brought on-line as demand increases. We believe these production lines will have the ability to meet our current and expected near-term V-Go demand. We also believe our CMO has the ability to scale production even further by replicating these production lines within its current facility. We also believe that, due to shared product design features, our production processes are readily adaptable to new products, including a pre-fill V-Go.
V-Go is packaged with one EZ Fill accessory per 30 V-Go devices. Due to its lower-volume requirements, one manufacturing line is dedicated to EZ Fill production, with a second line on standby. 
 Both V-Go and its insulin filling accessory, EZ Fill, are assembled from components that are manufactured to our specifications. Each completed device is tested to ensure compliance with our engineering and quality 
 
23 
 
 assurance specifications. A series of automated inspection checks, including x-ray assessments and lot-released testing, are also conducted throughout the manufacturing process to verify proper assembly and functionality. When mechanical components are sourced from outside vendors, those vendors must meet our detailed qualification and process control requirements. We maintain a team of product and process engineers, supply chain and quality personnel who provide product and production line support for V-Go and EZ-Fill. We also employ a full-time employee based in China. 
 We have received ISO 13485 certification of our quality system from BSI Group, a Notified Body to the International Standards Organization, or ISO. This certification process requires satisfaction of design control requirements. The processes utilized in the manufacturing and testing of our devices have been verified and validated to the extent required by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities and the facilities of our sterilization and other critical suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies. We believe that our manufacturing and quality systems are robust and ensure high product quality. To date, we have had no product recalls. 
 Some of the parts and components of V-Go and EZ Fill are purchased from sole-source vendors, and we manage any single-source components and suppliers through our global supply chain operation. We believe that, if necessary, alternative sources of supply would, in most cases, be available in a relatively short period of time and on commercially reasonable terms. 
 Research, Development and Engineering 
 Our research, development and engineering staff has significant experience in developing insulin-delivery systems and are focused on the continuous improvement and support of current product, as well as our products in development. We have a staff of experienced engineers specializing in mechanical engineering, material science and fluid mechanics. Because we do not incorporate electronics or software into our devices, our development and engineering teams are able to focus on these other technical areas. We utilize design and analysis tools to accelerate design times and reduce development risk. Through frequent usability testing, we seek to ensure that our product not only functions properly, but also meets patient needs and desires with respect to an insulin-delivery system, while at the same time reducing our development and commercialization risks. 
 We spent $6.5 million on research, development and engineering activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
 Intellectual Property 
 From our inception, we have understood that the strength of our competitive position will depend substantially upon our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property rights protecting our technology, and we have developed what we consider to be a strong intellectual property portfolio, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how. We continue to actively pursue a broad array of intellectual property protection in the United States, and in significant markets elsewhere in North America, as well as in Europe, Australia and Asia, including China. We believe our intellectual property portfolio effectively protects the products we currently market and we are actively building our intellectual property portfolio to protect our next-generation products, as well as additional drug delivery technologies for those products. 
 As more fully described below, our patents and patent applications are primarily directed to our h-Patch technology or aspects thereof including the commercialized V-Go, a hydraulically driven ambulatory insulin delivery device. 
 We also have patents and patent applications directed to other drug delivery platforms, the Mini-Ject and the Micro-Trans microneedle array patch. 
 
24 
 
In addition to patent protection, we rely on materials and manufacturing trade secrets, and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio by filing patent applications directed to novel drug delivery systems and methods of their use. 
 Patents 
 As of February 15, 2017, we owned 21 U.S. and 56 international issued or allowed patents and 8 U.S. and 46 international patents pending directed to various features of our commercial V-Go device and our proprietary h-Patch drug delivery technology.

Trademarks 
 We believe we have protected our trademarks, including our trademark of V-Go, through applications in all major markets worldwide as well as the United States. Our trademark portfolio consists of 16 registered trademarks, six of which are registered in the United States, including our V-Go logo. We also have nine trademark applications pending registration in several major markets outside the United States. 
 Trade Secrets and Know-How
We rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and know-how to protect our proprietary manufacturing processes and materials critical to our product. We seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our trade secrets and know-how in part by limiting the employees and third parties who have access to certain information and requiring employees and third parties to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, under which they are bound to assign to us inventions made during the term of their employment. These agreements further require employees to represent that they have no existing obligations and hold no interest that conflicts with any of their obligations under their agreements with us. We also generally require consultants, independent contractors and other third parties to sign agreements providing that any inventions that relate to our business are owned by us, and prohibiting them from disclosing or using our proprietary information except as may be authorized by us. 
 Competition 
 The medical technology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Competition in the diabetes market is particularly intense, due largely to the fact that products designed to treat diabetes currently compete with both traditional and new products. We compete with these products based on efficacy, price, reimbursement, ease of use and healthcare provider education. 
 Within the diabetes market, V-Go is cleared by the FDA for adult patients who require insulin, with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, although we position V-Go to compete primarily in the market for adult patients with Type 2 diabetes requiring insulin, particularly as part of a basal-bolus insulin regimen. Our primary competitors in the basal-bolus insulin therapy market are manufacturers of insulin and insulin pens, such as Novo Nordisk, Sanofi S.A. and Eli Lilly and Company. 
 In addition to basal-bolus insulin therapy, glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, analog injection products are another potential competitor to V-Go. GLP-1 analog injection products are used in combination with OADs or basal insulin injection. Some physicians, when faced with a patient who is unable to reach or maintain glucose levels at his or her goal with OADs, will add a GLP-1 through twice-daily, once-daily or once-weekly injections. As a result, we also compete with pharmaceutical manufacturers of GLP-1 analog injection products, such as AstraZeneca, Novo Nordisk and GlaxoSmithKline plc. In addition, we may compete with inhaled insulin products for bolus therapy, which have been recently introduced to the market. 
 In the area of basal-bolus device competition, we do not consider programmable insulin pumps to be products that compete directly with V-Go, as those products, although cleared for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, have 
 
26 
 
 been primarily designed and marketed for patients with Type 1 diabetes. We believe that the simple and discreet design and interface of V-Go more directly addresses the needs of patients with Type 2 diabetes. Patients with Type 2 diabetes, for example, are often taking many drugs for multiple diseases, including medications to treat high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol, and, as a result, they desire a simple to use and discreet method to deliver their insulin. We are not aware of any other single-use disposable, mechanical (which means the device does not include any electronics, batteries or audible alarms and does not require any recharging or programming), basal-bolus insulin delivery devices currently marketed or in development at this time. 
 Government Regulation 
 V-Go, our first commercialized product, received 510(k) clearance by the FDA in December 2010. Our product and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. Our product is subject to regulation as a medical device in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and related regulations enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA. 
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements 
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification submission, granting of a de novo classification request, or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classesClass I, Class II or Class III depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are subject to the FDAs general controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDAs general controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. 
 While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirements, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDAs permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Our currently marketed products are Class II devices subject to 510(k) clearance. 
 510(k) Marketing Clearance and De Novo Pathways 
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, a premarket notification submission must be submitted to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent another device cleared through the 510(k) process. The FDAs 510(k) review process usually takes from three to six months, but may take longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. 
 
27 
 
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant 510(k) clearance to market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo process, which may determine that the new device is of low to moderate risk and that it can be appropriately be regulated as a Class I or II device. If a de novo request is granted, the device may be legally marketed and a new classification is established. If the device is classified as Class II, the device may serve as a predicate for future 510(k) submissions. 
 After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review that decision and disagree with a manufacturers determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturers determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. We have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements to our 510(k)-cleared products. We cannot be assured that the FDA would agree with any of our decisions to not submit 510(k) premarket notifications for these modified devices. 
 V-Go is one of the first insulin delivery devices to be cleared under the FDAs Infusion Pump Improvement Initiative, which established additional device manufacturing requirements designed to foster the development of safer, more effective infusion pumps. The FDA launched this initiative in 2010 to support the benefits of external infusion pumps while minimizing the risks associated with these devices. As part of the initiative, FDA issued guidance requesting the inclusion of additional information in premarket submissions for infusion pumps beyond what has traditionally been provided, including detailed engineering information, a comprehensive discussion of steps taken to mitigate risks and additional design validation testing specific to the environment in which the device is intended to be used. 
 PMA Approval Pathway 
 Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) process. In a PMA the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain, among other things, a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of the PMA, although in practice, the FDAs review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panels recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers or suppliers manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical trial that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical trials post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer 
 
28 
 
 period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval. 
 Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Our product is not currently subject to PMA requirements. However, we may in the future develop devices that will require the submission of a PMA. 
 Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDAs investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a significant risk, to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must be approved prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies us that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. 
 In addition, the clinical trial must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the trial, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the trial. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still certain IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan. 
 During a clinical trial, the sponsor is required to comply with applicable FDA requirements, and the clinical investigators are also subject to FDAs regulations. Both must comply with good clinical practice requirements, or GCPs, which among other things requires that informed consent be obtained from each research subject, that the investigational plan and study protocol be followed, that the disposition of the investigational device be controlled, and that reporting and recordkeeping requirements are followed. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief 
 
29 
 
 that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a clinical trial is completed, there can be no assurance that the data generated during a clinical trial will meet the safety and effectiveness endpoints or otherwise produce results that will lead the FDA to grant marketing clearance or approval. 
 Post-Market Regulation 
 After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 
 

 | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 | Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | labeling regulations and requirements related to promotional activities, including FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or off-label uses of cleared or approved products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | medical device reporting requirements, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the FDAs mandatory recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we and our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our product. The discovery of previously unknown problems with our product, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. The FDA has broad enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions: 
 

 | warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
30 
 

 | refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusal to grant export approvals for our product; or
--+------------------------------------------------------


 | criminal prosecution.

U.S. Anti-Kickback, False Claims and Other Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 We are also subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments and authorities in the locations in which we conduct our business. These other agencies include, without limitation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, as well as state and local governments. Such agencies enforce a variety of laws which include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. Among other things, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statutes intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate, in order to have committed a violation. 
 The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to or approval by the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes any request or demand for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under the federal civil False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses. In addition, the federal civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined 
 
31 
 
 to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to its amendment of the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act also broadened the reach of certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes created under HIPAA by amending the intent requirement such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. 
 There has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for knowing failures. Covered manufacturers were required to report detailed payment data for the first reporting period (August 1, 2013December 31, 2013) under this law and submit legal attestation to the completeness and accuracy of such data by June 30, 2014. Thereafter, covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. In addition, certain states require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry is cost containment. The federal government and state legislatures have attempted to control healthcare costs in part by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular drug products, including implementing price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. By way of example, the Affordable Care Act contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products. 
 In January 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate passed legislation, which, if signed into law by the new administration, would repeal certain aspects of the ACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, the new administration signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. 
 
32 
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not recommend and Congress did not enact legislation to reduce the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislations automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. 
 We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product or additional pricing pressures. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of our product depend, in significant part, on the extent to which our product is covered and reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, including, without limitation, Medicare Part D plans, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Patients who use V-Go generally rely on these third-party payors to pay for all or part of the costs of our product. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drug products have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for drug products and medical services, examining the medical necessity, reviewing the cost effectiveness, and questioning the safety and efficacy of such products and services. If these third-party payors do not consider our product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our product at a profit. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. 
 Currently, a number of third-party payors have coverage policies that permit coverage for V-Go, either under the pharmacy or medical benefit. For example, a majority of Medicare Part D plans make coverage for our product available under the outpatient prescription drug benefit. A number of private payors and Medicaid programs also permit coverage for V-Go under the pharmacy benefit. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product typically is separate from the process for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors, including, without limitation, Medicare Part D plans, may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Continued placement on formularies is therefore critical for reimbursement. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product could reduce physician utilization of our product. Moreover, a third-party payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development, sales and marketing. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payors decision to cover a particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product to each payor separately and will continue to be a time-consuming process. 
 V-Go currently is not covered under Medicare Part B because V-Go is a disposable insulin dispensing device, which is not a recognized Part B benefit. In addition, some private third-party payors have determined that there is insufficient data for coverage and concluded that V-Go is investigational or experimental. Those payors may 
 
33 
 
 determine at a future date that our product, including V-Go, will be covered and because coverage and reimbursement varies significantly from payor to payor, the process to obtain favorable recognition is time-consuming. 
 We currently have contracts establishing reimbursement for V-Go with national and regional third-party payors in the United States. While we anticipate entering into additional contracts with third-party payors, we cannot guarantee that we will succeed in doing so or that the reimbursement contracts we are able to negotiate will enable us to sell our product on a profitable basis. In addition, contracts with third-party payors generally can be modified or terminated by the third-party payor without cause and with little or no notice to us. Moreover, compliance with the administrative procedures or requirements of third-party payors may result in delays in processing approvals by those third-party payors for customers to obtain coverage for V-Go. Failure to secure or retain adequate coverage or reimbursement for V-Go by third-party payors, or delays in processing approvals by those payors, could result in the loss of sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
