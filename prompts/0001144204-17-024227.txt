News Content Licensing
 
We have our own team comprising journalists and editors who produce approximately 350 - 500 news articles/reports on a daily basis, covering real-time diversified news including politics, finance, life, technology, sport, entertainment, travel and others. Besides, NOWnews Network also licenses its self-created news content to major portals and corporate partners with more extensive news network, such as Yahoo Hong Kong, Yahoo Taiwan, MSN Taiwan, Yam, Sina Taiwan, Taiwan Mobile, Chunghwa Telecom, Far EasTone Telecommunications Co. Ltd., Vibo Telecom, etc.
 
Historically, we provided editing services to customers including selecting, sorting, editing news for other website operators such as Yahoo Taiwan. We ceased this service in December 2013 because this service was not profitable. In addition, we used to provide film/video editing services and licensed copyrights to a related party, Chunghwa Wideband Best Network Co., Ltd., and stopped in later 2013.
 
Seasonality
 
We have experienced seasonality in our online advertising business. Historically, the periods from May through August and from November to January have seen increase of more than 20% in advertising revenues due to the summer break and the winter holiday season. February has historically been the worst month for our advertising business as it is after the Lunar New Year holidays when advertising revenues are generally down nationwide. Past performance may not be indicative of future trends, as the mix of advertising industry sectors, which may have different seasonality factors, may shift from quarter to quarter. There is no seasonality in its licensing business.

If we fail to comply with the PIPA, we may be subject to serious punishment for civil claims, criminal offenses and administrative liabilities: the ceiling of the aggregate compensation amount for damages payable in a single case will be up to NT$200 million or the actual value of loss arising from our violation provided the amount of actual value of such loss is higher than NT$200 million; the defendant may be subject to an imprisonment of up to five years; and the penalty for administrative liabilities will be up to NT$500,000 for each violation, and may be imposed consecutively if such violation continues.

Enforceability of Judgments in Taiwan
 
All of our directors and executive officers named in this report are residents of Taiwan and substantially all of our assets and the assets of those persons are located in Taiwan. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon us or those persons outside of Taiwan, or to enforce against them judgments obtained in courts outside of Taiwan. Any final judgment obtained against us in any court other than the courts of the Republic of China in connection with any legal suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to our securities will be enforced by the courts of the Republic of China without further review of the merits only if the court of the Republic of China in which enforcement is sought is satisfied that:
 
the court rendering the judgment has jurisdiction over the subject matter according to the laws of the Republic of China;
 
the judgment and the court procedure resulting in the judgment are not contrary to the public order or good morals of the Republic of China;
 
if the judgment was rendered by default by the court rendering the judgment, we, or our officers and directors, were duly served within a reasonable period of time in accordance with the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction of the court or process was served on us with judicial assistance of the Republic of China; and
 
judgments at the courts of the Republic of China are recognized and enforceable in the court rendering the judgment on a reciprocal basis.
 
A party seeking to enforce a foreign judgment in the Republic of China would be required to obtain foreign exchange approval from the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) for the payment out of Taiwan of any amounts recovered in connection with the judgment denominated in a currency other than NT dollars if a conversion from NT dollars to a foreign currency is involved.

Market Opportunities
 
Our current primary focus is on the Taiwan market. The success of our business is tied to the size and vitality of Taiwan’s economy. According to the International Monetary Fund, Taiwan’s gross domestic product in 2016 grew 0.97% year over year to $519.15 billion.
 
Taiwan has one of the most advanced telecommunications networks in Asia. With excellent telecommunications infrastructure in place and the innovative use of breakthrough information technologies, Taiwan continues to be well placed to drive both mobile and data communications services.
 
Competition
 
The market for Web sites offering online content and services targeting the global Chinese community is competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future. Many of the companies attempting to address this market offer portal, content and e-commerce services. The following table lists the Chinese-language Web sites that we believe are currently our primary competitors in Taiwan:
 
udn.com
 appledaily.com.tw
 Chinatimes.com
 ltn.com.tw
 ettoday.net
 
As internet usage in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (collectively, the “Greater China”) increases and the Greater China market becomes more attractive to advertisers and for conducting fee-based services, large global competitors, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Google, Twitter, Line, Kakao and WhatsApp, may increasingly focus their resources on the Greater China market. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in competing against the established and emerging competitors in the market. The increased competition could result in reduced traffic, loss of market share and revenues, and lower profit margins.
 
Our ability to compete successfully depends on many factors, including the quality of our content, the breadth, depth and ease of use of our services, our sales and marketing efforts and the performance of our technology.
 
Competitive Strength
 
We provide online content and services for the global Chinese community with a focus on Taiwan, including but not limited to informational features, social media and social networking services as well as other fee-based services. This industry can be characterized as highly competitive and rapidly changing due to the fast growing market demand. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and current and new competitors can launch new websites or services at a relatively low cost. Many companies offer various content and services targeting this community that compete with us. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources, a longer history of providing online services, a larger and more active user base, more established brand names and currently offer a greater breadth of products that may be more popular than our online offerings. However, we believe that we possess the following competitive strengths that enable us to compete effectively:
 
We have an outstanding editorial team which produces hundreds of news on a daily basis, covering real-time diversified news including politics, finance, life, technology, sport, entertainment, travel and others. Besides, we license our self-created news content to major portals and corporate partners with a stable and extensive news network. We believe this is very critical to attract readers and increase traffic volume of our website.
 
We have been focusing on new media operations and interaction with its members and fans. We believe we are the first news media which opened official accounts on LINE and WeChat, two very popular mobile messengers in Asia and created NOWnews Network fan group on Facebook.
 
With the growing popularity of mobile devices, we are the first to develop applications on mobile devices offering users real-time news anywhere at any time. The current daily traffic on our website exceeds 14 million and is mobile website has a daily traffic volume of approximately 4 million.

We have a very large member base, which includes approximately 350,000 Facebook fans and 820,000 LINE subscribers and 100,000 Wechat subscribers. We believe this member base will keep increasing and we will leverage this membership base to expand our business. PRC implements strict control over the media. However, we are the only Taiwan internet media to which the PRC residents have full access – this, we believe, provides us with access to a very large potential reader base and tremendous business opportunities. Currently, approximately 8% of our traffic is from the PRC. Through our platform, we can build a cross-strait service system where we can promote Taiwan’s services or products to readers in the PRC. However, PRC regulatory authorities may find the contents on our website/mobile applications objectionable and block users in China from accessing our website and/or mobile applications.
 
Technology Infrastructure
 
Our operating infrastructure is designed to serve and deliver hundreds of millions of page views a day to our users. This scalable infrastructure allows our users to access our products and services quickly and efficiently, regardless of their geographical location. Our infrastructure is also designed to provide high-speed access by forwarding queries to our Web hosting sites with greater resources or lower loads. Our Web pages are generated, served and cached by servers hosted at various co-location Web hosting sites in Taiwan and the United States.
 
Our servers run on our own web-based platforms. These servers are maintained at Amazon in the United States and our offices in Taiwan. We believe that our hosting partners provide significant operating advantages, including an enhanced ability to protect our systems from power loss, break-ins and other potential external causes of service interruption. They provide continuous customer service, multiple connections to the Internet and a continuous power supply to our systems. In addition, we conduct online monitoring of all our systems for accessibility, load, system resources, network- server intrusion and timeliness of content.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We enhance our brand images and visibility through participating in various public events, exchanging resources with other companies, and establishing partnership with other media companies. In addition, we focus on keyword marketing and search engine optimizing to increase the search ranking of our news content.
Research and Development
 
Currently, we focus on (i) developing the Drupal platform to host our website and (ii) using Drupal to build daily news from personal blogs and company applications. Drupal is an open source content management platform powering millions of websites and applications. It’s built, used, and supported by an active and diverse community of people around the world and has thousands of add-on modules and designs available for us to build and improve our website.

Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. From time to time, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.
 
In addition, third parties may initiate litigation against us alleging infringement of their proprietary rights. In the event of a successful claim of infringement and our failure or inability to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. In addition, even if we are able to license the infringed or similar technology, license fees could be substantial and may adversely affect our results of operations.

NOTE 2: GOING CONCERN
 
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred significant losses and has not demonstrated the ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy its liabilities and sustain operations. The Company had accumulated deficits of $7,932,295 and $4,400,189, and stockholders’ deficits of $1,380,173 and $819,522 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net losses attributable to common stockholders of $3,532,106 and $477,810 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, current liabilities exceed current assets by $858,428 and $497,578 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing significant working capital deficits. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable.  If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
Management’s Plan to Continue as a Going Concern
 
In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plans to obtain such resources for the Company include (1) obtaining capital from the sale of its equity securities, (2) sales of the Company’s services, (3) short-term and long-term borrowings from banks, and (4) short-term borrowings from stockholders or other related party(ies) when needed. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.
 
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually to secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations.
 
NOTE 3: BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Basis of presentation:
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Since the Company, Worldwide, and NOWnews Network were entities under common control prior to the restructuring transaction, the Company and Worldwide have recast prior period financial statements to reflect the conveyance of NOWnews Network to Sky Media as if the restructuring transaction had occurred as of January 1, 2014. All significant intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated.
 
The functional currency of NOWnews Network and NOWnews International is the New Taiwan dollars, however the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated and presented in United States Dollars ($). In the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes, “$”, “US$” and “U.S. dollars” mean United States dollars, and “NT$” and “NT dollars” mean New Taiwan dollars.

Use of estimates and assumptions:
 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made. However, actual results could differ materially from those results. The most significant estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements include depreciation, useful lives of property and equipment, deferred income taxes, useful life of intangible assets and contingencies. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary.
 
Cash and cash equivalents:
 
The Company considers all cash on hand and in banks, certificates of deposit and other highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has uninsured deposits in banks of $122,508 and $100,536.
 
Accounts receivable:
 
The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company assessed the allowance for doubtful accounts of $9,464 and $14,121, respectively.
 
Property and equipment:
 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Gains or losses on disposals are reflected as gain or loss in the year of disposal. The cost of improvements that extends the life of property and equipment are capitalized. These capitalized costs may include structural improvements, equipment, and fixtures. All ordinary repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
 
Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or lease term as follows:
 

Electronic Equipment | 3 years 
-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------
Computer Equipment | 3 to 5 years 
Office Equipment and Furniture | 3 to 5 years 
Leasehold Improvement | Lesser of term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets

 
Long-lived assets:
 
The Company applies the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 360 (ASC 360), “Property, Plant, and Equipment” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used in accordance with ASC 360, at least on an annual basis. ASC 360 requires the impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for the cost of disposal.

Intangible assets:
 
Intangible assets consist of software, trademark, and copyrights (see Note 6). At least annually, the Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Estimating future cash flows related to an intangible asset involves significant estimates and assumptions. If the Company’s assumptions are not correct, there could be an impairment loss or, in the case of a change in the estimated useful life of the asset, a change in amortization expense. There was no impairment of intangible assets as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Leases:
 
Lease agreements are evaluated to determine if they are capital leases meeting any of the following criteria at inception: (a) Transfer of ownership; (b) Bargain purchase option; (c) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property; (d) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals or exceeds 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at lease inception over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor.
 
If at its inception a lease meets any of the four lease criteria above, the lease is classified by the lessee as a capital lease; and if none of the four criteria are met, the lease is classified by the lessee as an operating lease.
 
Revenue recognition:
 
Product and service revenue is recognized when the following fundamental criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or the service has been performed, (iii) the Company’s price to the customer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured.  Payments received before satisfaction of all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue. The Company recognizes revenue for product sales upon transfer of title to the customer.  The Company recognizes revenue for services upon performance of the service.  Customer purchase orders and/or contracts will generally be used to determine the existence of an arrangement.  Shipping documents and the completion of any customer acceptance requirements, when applicable, will be used to verify product delivery or that services have been rendered.  The Company will assess whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. The Company will record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments in the same period that the related revenue is recorded.  These estimates will be based on industry-based historical data, historical sales returns, if any, analysis of credit memo data, and other factors known at the time.
 
Post-retirement and post-employment benefits:
 
NOWnews Network adopted the government mandated defined contribution plan pursuant to the Labor Pension Act (the “Act”) in Taiwan. Such labor regulations require that the rate of contribution made by an employer to the Labor Pension Fund per month shall not be less than 6% of the worker's monthly salaries. Pursuant to the Act, NOWnews Network makes monthly contribution equal to 6% of employees’ salaries to the employees’ pension fund. NOWnews Network has no legal obligation for the benefits beyond the contributions made. The total amounts for such employee benefits, which were expensed as incurred, were $78,327 and $56,506 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other than the above, the Company does not provide any other post-retirement or post-employment benefits.

Foreign currency translation:
 
The Company uses the United States dollar ("U.S. dollars") for financial reporting purposes. The Company maintains the books and records in its functional currency, being the primary currency of the economic environment in which its operations are conducted. For reporting purpose, the Company translates the assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet dates, and the statements of income are translated at average exchange rates during the reporting periods. Gain or loss on foreign currency transactions are reflected on the income statement. Gain or loss on financial statement translation from foreign currency are recorded as a separate component in the equity section of the balance sheet and is included as part of accumulated other comprehensive income. The functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries in Taiwan is New Taiwan Dollars.
 
Statement of cash flows:
 
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 230, “Statement of Cash Flows,” cash flows from the Company’s operations are calculated based upon the local currencies, and translated to the reporting currency using an average foreign exchange rate for the reporting period. As a result, amounts related to changes in assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheets.
 
Income taxes:
 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The deferred income tax assets were $0 as of both December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 
The Company applied the provisions of ASC 740-10-50, “Accounting For Uncertainty In Income Taxes”, which provides clarification related to the process associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements. Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the Company’s liability for income taxes. Any such adjustment could be material to the Company’s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part, upon the results of operations for the given period. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, management considered that the Company had no uncertain tax positions, and will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future.
 
The Company is subject to the tax authority in Taiwan for years since incorporated.
 
Earnings per share (EPS):
 
Earnings per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260. Basic earnings per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock instruments were converted or exercised. Options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period if the average stock price for the period is greater than the exercise price of the warrants and options. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, no options or warrants were issued or outstanding.
 
Discontinued operations
 
Results of the Company’s discontinued entity have been presented in discontinued operations in the financial statements. See Note 1 and Note 12 for additional information.

Reclassifications:
 
Certain classifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. The reclassification had no impact on previously reported net loss or accumulated deficit.
 
Recent accounting pronouncements:
 
On November 17, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, to address the diversity in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows under Topic 230. The amendments in this Update require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities that have restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents and are required to present a statement of cash flows under Topic 230. The Company is still in progress of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard.
On October 26, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-17—Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control to amend the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity (VIE) should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. Under the amendments, a single decision maker is not required to consider indirect interests held through related parties that are under common control with the single decision maker to be the equivalent of direct interests in their entirety. Instead, a single decision maker is required to include those interests on a proportionate basis consistent with indirect interests held through other related parties. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.
On October 24, 2016, Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16—Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory to prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. In addition, interpretations of this guidance have developed in practice for transfers of certain intangible and tangible assets. This prohibition on recognition is an exception to the principle of comprehensive recognition of current and deferred income taxes in GAAP. To more faithfully represent the economics of intra-entity asset transfers, the amendments in this Update require that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amendments in this Update do not change GAAP for the pre-tax effects of an intra-entity asset transfer under Topic 810, Consolidation, or for an intra-entity transfer of inventory. The Company is still in progress of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard.
On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), a consensus of the FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force. The Update is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in this Update provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: Issue 1 - Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs.  Issue 2 - Settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments. . Issue 3 - Contingent consideration payments made after a business combination.  Issue 4 - Proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims.  Issue 5 - Proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policies, including bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) policies.  Issue 6 - Distributions received from equity method investments.  7 - Beneficial interests in securitization transactions. . Issue 8 - Separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The amendments in this Update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is still in progress of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard.

In February 25, 2016, FASB issued ASU-2016-02-Leases. The amendments in this Update create Topic 842, Leases, and supersede the leases requirements in Topic 840, Leases. The objective of Topic 842 is to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease. The FASB is issuing this Update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 affects any entity that enters into a lease (as that term is defined in this Update), with some specified scope exemptions. The guidance in this Update supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The main difference between previous GAAP and Topic 842 is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. All leases create an asset and a liability for the lessee in accordance with FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, and, therefore, recognition of those lease assets and lease liabilities represents an improvement over previous GAAP, which did not require lease assets and lease liabilities to be recognized for most leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. When measuring assets and liabilities arising from a lease, a lessee (and a lessor) should include payments to be made in optional periods only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. Similarly, optional payments to purchase the underlying asset should be included in the measurement of lease assets and lease liabilities only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that purchase option. Reasonably certain is a high threshold that is consistent with and intended to be applied in the same way as the reasonably assured threshold in the previous leases guidance. In addition, also consistent with the previous leases guidance, a lessee (and a lessor) should exclude most variable lease payments in measuring lease assets and lease liabilities, other than those that depend on an index or a rate or are in substance fixed payments. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is still in progress of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard.
 
In November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17- Income Taxes. The Board is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative). The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is still in progress of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard. 
 
In August 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-15 – Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40). The amendments in this Update states the disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. An entity’s management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). When management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt, management should consider whether its plans will alleviate the substantial doubt. When substantial doubt is raised but is alleviated by management’s plans, the entity should disclose following information: (a) Principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt (before consideration of management’s plans); (b) Management’s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity’s ability to meet its obligations; (c) Management’s plans that alleviated the substantial doubt.

When substantial doubt is raised but is not alleviated by management’s plans,, an entity should include a statement in the footnotes indicating that there is substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued), and disclose the following information: (a) Principal conditions or events that raise substantial doubt; (b) Management’s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity’s ability to meet its obligations; (c) Management’s plans that are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise the substantial doubt.
 
The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is still in progress of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard.

 | December 31, | | | December 31, | 
---------------------------------+--------------+------------+---+--------------+--

Deferred tax assets, net | $ | - | | | $ | - | 

 
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating losses and temporary differences become deductible. Management considered projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company accrued 100% valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets based on the assessment of the probability of future realization.
 
NOTE 9: STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company was authorized to issue a total of 50,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share.
 
On June 4, 2013, Worldwide issued 17,000,000 common shares to Mr. Alan Chen as founder’s shares for no consideration exchanged. As a result, a discount on capital of $17,000,000 was recorded. On the same date, Mr. Chen conveyed 1,000,000 shares, 8,548,000 shares, 3,816,000 shares, and 3,636,000 shares to Legend Media Investments Co., Ltd., Pioneer Media Investments Co., Ltd., Intelligent Media Investments Co., Ltd., and Core Winner Investment Limited, respectively (collectively, the “Recipients”).

On September 16, 2013, Worldwide entered into a written Definitive Agreement with GIA Investments Gorp. (“GIA”), an unrelated party (the “Definitive Agreement”). Pursuant to the provisions of the Definitive Agreement, Worldwide would acquire NOWnews Network pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, and Worldwide will fund the operations of NOWnews Network for a period of approximately 8 months. Additionally, Worldwide desires to be acquired by an unidentified company (defined in the Definitive Agreement as “Company A”), pursuant to a stock exchange agreement, and Company A will be a participant in the OTCQB. As specified in the Definitive Agreement, GIA intends to acquire 15% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company A’s common stock for $3,000,000, and Worldwide intends that its existing shareholders will acquire 84% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company A’s common stock.
 
Pursuant to the Definitive Agreement, during September through December 2013, GIA funded an aggregate of $1,522,388 to Worldwide, which was recorded as “Subscriptions received in advance” on Worldwide’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013. On May 23, 2014, Worldwide issued 3,000,000 common shares to GIA for the proceeds received.
