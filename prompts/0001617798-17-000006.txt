ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a growth-oriented limited partnership focused on owning, operating, acquiring and developing midstream energy infrastructure assets in North America. Our sponsor, PennTex Development, was formed by members of its original management team and by NGP in 2014 to develop a multi-basin midstream growth platform initially in partnership with oil and natural gas producers affiliated with NGP. 
On November 1, 2016, ETP acquired from NGP and certain other contributors (i) all of the outstanding membership interests in PennTex Development, (ii) 6,301,596 common units and 20,000,000 subordinated units collectively representing approximately 65% of the outstanding limited partner interests in the Partnership, (iii) all of the outstanding membership interests in our general partner and (iv) all of the Partnership’s incentive distribution rights. As a result of such transaction, ETP owns our general partner and controls the Partnership.
We currently provide natural gas gathering and processing and residue gas and NGL transportation services to producers focused on the Cotton Valley formation in northern Louisiana. Our assets primarily consist of natural gas gathering pipeline, two 200 MMcf/d design-capacity cryogenic natural gas processing plants and residue gas and NGL transportation pipelines. Our primary customer is Range Resources, which completed its acquisition of Memorial Resource in September 2016. Prior to its acquisition by Range Resources, Memorial Resource was an affiliate of NGP and was our primary customer. In addition to providing midstream services to our primary customer with our existing assets, we pursue other opportunities for organic development and growth as producers in our region continue to develop their acreage.
Our assets are supported by long term, fee-based commercial agreements with Range Resources, including gathering and processing agreements that contain minimum volume commitments. Under the AMI and Exclusivity Agreement, we also have the exclusive right to develop, own and operate midstream assets and to provide midstream services to support Range Resources’ growing production in northern Louisiana (other than production subject to existing third-party commitments or other arrangements to which we consent).
Our Assets
We operate and manage our business as a single reportable segment. Our assets are located in northern Louisiana and currently consist of the following:

• | the Lincoln Parish plant, a 200 MMcf/d design-capacity cryogenic natural gas processing plant located near Arcadia, Louisiana;


• | the Mt. Olive plant, a 200 MMcf/d design-capacity cryogenic natural gas processing plant located near Ruston, Louisiana with on-site liquids handling facilities for inlet gas;


• | a 35-mile rich natural gas gathering system that provides producers with access to our processing plants and third-party processing capacity;


• | a 15-mile residue natural gas pipeline that provides market access for natural gas from our processing plants, including connections with pipelines that provide access to the Perryville Hub and other markets in the Gulf Coast region;


• | a 40-mile NGL pipeline that provides connections to the Mont Belvieu market for NGLs produced from our processing plants; and


• | approximately 3 miles of natural gas gathering facilities in the Vernon Field in Jackson Parish, Louisiana, including connections with pipelines that provide access to the Perryville Hub and other markets in the Gulf Coast region.

Our Contractual Arrangements with Range Resources
Range Resources is an independent natural gas and oil company focused on stacked-pay projects in the Appalachian Basin and northern Louisiana. Our long-term gathering and processing agreements with Range Resources contain minimum volume commitments, and our gathering agreement also provides for firm capacity reservation payments based on available gathering system capacity. In addition, under our long-term, fee-based residue gas and NGL transportation agreements, we transport all of the residue gas and NGLs produced on behalf of Range Resources at our processing plants. 
Natural Gas Processing. Our 15-year gas processing agreement with Range Resources contains minimum volume commitments that are measured on a cumulative basis and based on specified daily minimum volume thresholds. The daily minimum volume threshold is currently 460,000 MMBtu/d through June 30, 2026, then decreases to 345,000 MMBtu/d until June 1, 2030 and to 115,000 MMBtu/d until the initial term of the processing agreement ends on September 30, 2030. Any volumes of gas delivered up to the then-applicable daily minimum volume threshold are considered firm reserved gas and are charged the firm-service fixed fee, and any volumes delivered in excess of such threshold are considered interruptible volumes and are charged the interruptible-service fixed fee, in each case subject to CPI-based adjustments. Range Resources must pay a quarterly deficiency payment based on the firm-commitment fixed fee if the cumulative minimum volume commitment as of the end of such quarter exceeds the sum of (i) the cumulative volumes processed (or credited with respect to plant interruptions) under the processing agreement as of the end of such quarter plus (ii) volumes corresponding to deficiency payments incurred prior to such quarter. Deficiency payments are credited towards any fees owed by Range Resources only to the extent it has delivered the total minimum volume commitment under the processing agreement within the initial 15-year term of the agreement. Deficiency payments are recorded as deferred revenue because Range Resources may utilize these deficiency payments as credit for fees owed if it has delivered the total minimum volume commitment under the processing agreement within the initial term of the agreement. 
Natural Gas Gathering. Our 15-year natural gas gathering agreement with Range Resources commenced on December 20, 2014 and will remain in effect until June 1, 2030. The gathering agreement includes a firm capacity reservation payment and a usage fee component that is subject to a minimum volume commitment. Currently and for the period ending November 30, 2019, (i) the firm capacity reservation payment is payable for a daily capacity of 460,000 MMBtu/d (subject to certain credits relating to the availability of gathering capacity), calculated monthly, and (ii) the usage fee component is payable for volumes delivered into the gathering system, subject to a deficiency fee based on a specified minimum volume commitment that is calculated and paid on an annual basis. The deficiency fee calculation is based on Range Resources’ then applicable daily minimum volume commitment under the processing agreement, which is currently 460,000 MMBtu/d. Beginning December 1, 2019, no firm capacity reservation payment will be payable, and the usage fee component will increase, subject to the deficiency fee and specified minimum volume commitment described above.
We also gather natural gas produced by Range Resources in the Vernon Field area of northern Louisiana pursuant to a separate long-term fee-based gathering agreement that contains minimum volume commitments.
Residue Gas Transportation. Our 15-year natural gas transportation agreement with Range Resources commenced June 1, 2015 and will remain in effect until June 1, 2030. The agreement provides for the transportation of residue gas through our residue gas pipeline from our processing plants to interconnections with third-party natural gas transportation pipelines providing access to Gulf Coast markets. Range Resources pays a usage fee for all volumes transported under the agreement. Range Resources pays an additional fee for priority firm service for the first 100,000 MMBtu/d of residue gas delivered to us for transportation by Range Resources. The agreement includes a plant tailgate dedication pursuant to which all of Range Resources’ residue gas delivered from our processing plants is transported on the residue gas pipeline.
NGL Transportation. Our 15-year NGL transportation agreement with Range Resources commenced October 1, 2015 and will remain in effect until October 1, 2030. The agreement provides for the transportation of NGLs through our NGL pipeline from our processing plants to an interconnect with DCP Midstream’s Black Lake pipeline near Ada, Louisiana. Range Resources pays a usage fee for all volumes transported under the agreement. The agreement includes a plant tailgate dedication pursuant to which all NGLs produced by us for Range Resources are transported on the NGL pipeline. The NGL transportation agreement is subject to the terms of our tariff, which is filed with FERC.

AMI and Exclusivity Agreement. Pursuant to the AMI and Exclusivity Agreement, we have the exclusive right to build all of the midstream infrastructure for Range Resources in northern Louisiana and to provide midstream services to support Range Resources’ current and future production on its operated acreage within such area (other than production subject to existing third-party commitments or other arrangements to which we consent) through September 30, 2030. The area of mutual interest under the AMI and Exclusivity Agreement is depicted below:
Our Relationship with Energy Transfer
ETP is a publicly traded Delaware master limited partnership managed by its general partner, ETP GP, which is in turn managed by its general partner, ETP LLC. ETE, a publicly traded master limited partnership, owns ETP LLC. Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, ETP conducts natural gas operations, including natural gas gathering and processing services, intrastate and interstate natural gas transportation and storage, NGL transportation, storage and fractionation and product and crude oil transportation, terminalling services and marketing activities.
ETP owns all of the membership interests in our general partner, all of our incentive distribution rights and 6,301,596 common units and 20,000,000 subordinated units collectively representing an approximate 65% limited partner interest in the Partnership. Accordingly, Energy Transfer controls the Partnership. In connection with the ETP acquisition, ETP replaced a majority of the directors of our general partner and our executive management team with individuals affiliated with Energy Transfer. 
On November 21, 2016, ETP announced that it had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with SXL and their respective general partners and, for certain limited purposes, ETE (the “ETP/SXL Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the ETP/SXL Merger Agreement, upon the completion of the transactions set forth therein, ETP would become a wholly owned subsidiary of SXL and SXL GP would become a wholly owned subsidiary of ETE. ETP expects the ETP/SXL merger to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to approval by ETP unitholders.
 Such transaction, if completed, would result in SXL indirectly owning our general partner and controlling the Partnership. However, because ETE would continue to control SXL and, accordingly, the Partnership, we do not expect that the transaction will have a material impact on the Partnership.

The following simplified diagram depicts our organizational structure and ownership as of December 31, 2016: 
Business Strategies
Our principal business objective is to increase the quarterly cash distributions that we pay to our unitholders over time while maintaining the ongoing stability of our business. We expect to achieve this objective by pursuing the following business strategies:

• | Maintain and grow stable cash flows supported by long-term, fee-based contracts. Our cash flows and distributions to unitholders are supported by escalating minimum volume commitments under our gathering and processing agreements with Range Resources. We also benefit from firm capacity reservation payments under our gathering agreement and plant tailgate dedications under our residue gas and NGL transportation agreements. We seek to generate the majority of our cash flows pursuant to multi-year, firm contracts with creditworthy customers.

• | Capitalize on organic growth to support growing production in northern Louisiana. Our primary customer has a deep inventory of drilling locations in northern Louisiana and we currently provide gathering and processing services to other producers with significant acreage in the area. We believe that the superior economics of Cotton Valley drilling programs in northern Louisiana, which are attributable to the stacked-pay opportunities, high initial production rates and strategic location, will continue to support significant drilling activity in the region. As production continues to increase in the region, we expect to capitalize on opportunities to expand our initial asset base to support increasing midstream service needs in northern Louisiana, including building additional infrastructure for Range Resources under the AMI and Exclusivity Agreement.


• | Maintain a conservative and flexible capital structure in order to support our access to capital. We intend to maintain a conservative and balanced capital structure which, when combined with our stable, fee-based cash flows, will afford us efficient access to the capital markets at a competitive cost of capital. As of December 31, 2016, our total indebtedness consisted of approximately $168.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our $275 million revolving credit facility and we had additional available borrowing capacity of $106.0 million.


• | Grow our business by pursuing accretive acquisitions and development opportunities. We intend to pursue opportunities to grow our business through accretive acquisitions as they become available, both as bolt-on opportunities for our existing assets in northern Louisiana and as strategic acquisitions in other economic basins.

Competition
Our principal competitor in northern Louisiana is ETP, which owns and operates significant legacy gathering, processing and transportation assets in the region, as well as all of the membership interests in our parent. In addition, producers in the region own, and may in the future construct additional, localized gathering pipelines to transport production from the wellhead to processing facilities or residue gas outlets. We compete directly with ETP and, to a lesser extent, producer-owned gathering systems, for undedicated, expiring dedicated and future production of producers in northern Louisiana. However, our AMI and Exclusivity Agreement with Range Resources, the largest and most active producer (based on rig count) in the area in which our assets are located, provides us the exclusive right to provide midstream services to support Range Resources’ current and future production on its operated acreage in northern Louisiana (other than production subject to existing third-party commitments or other arrangements to which we consent). 
Our ability to attract third-party volumes to our gathering, processing and transportation system depends on our ability to evaluate and select suitable projects and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. In addition, as a provider of midstream services to the natural gas and crude oil industries, we generally compete with other forms of energy available to consumers, including electricity, coal, propane and fuel oils. Several factors influence the demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, including price changes, the availability of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation and governmental regulations, weather and the ability to convert to alternative fuels.
Title to Properties
Other than the Mt. Olive plant site, which we own in fee, our interest in the real property on which our processing plants, pipelines and related facilities are located derives from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities permitting the use of such land for our operations. We have leased or acquired easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses in these lands without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets will be located, and we believe that we have satisfactory interests in such lands. 
Regulation of Operations
Our operations are subject to significant regulations at the federal, state and local levels. 
Natural Gas Gathering Pipeline Regulation
Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC under the NGA. Although FERC has not made any formal determinations with respect to any of our facilities we consider to be natural gas gathering facilities, we believe that our natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish whether a pipeline is a gathering pipeline not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and FERC determines whether facilities are natural gas gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of some of our gathering facilities and intrastate transportation pipelines may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts, or Congress. If FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility is not a gathering pipeline and that the pipeline provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the NGA or the NGPA. Such 
5

regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or NGPA, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the rate established by FERC.
State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. Our natural gas gathering operations will be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which we operate. These statutes generally require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another similarly situated source of supply. The regulations under these statutes can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas. States in which we operate have also adopted a complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. To date, there has been no adverse effect to our system due to state regulations.
Our natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to more stringent application of state regulation of rates and services. Our gathering operations also may be or become subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.
NGL Pipeline Regulation
Our NGL pipeline is a common carrier of NGLs subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. FERC regulates interstate pipeline transportation of crude oil, petroleum products and other liquids, such as NGLs (collectively, “petroleum pipelines”), under the Interstate Commerce Act, or the ICA, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, or EPAct 1992, and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on petroleum pipelines be just and reasonable, and that such rates must not be unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference upon any shipper. In accordance with FERC regulations, transportation rates and terms and conditions of service must be filed with FERC prior to placing the pipeline into service. Under the ICA, interested persons may challenge new or changed rates or services. FERC is authorized to investigate such charges and may suspend the effectiveness of a challenged rate for up to seven months. A successful rate challenge could result in a petroleum pipeline paying refunds together with interest for the period that the rate was in effect. FERC may also investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, existing rates and related rules and may order a pipeline to change them prospectively. A shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained for a period up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint.
If our rate levels were investigated by FERC on its own initiative or in response to a protest or complaint filed by an interested person, the inquiry could result in a comparison of our rates to those charged by others or to an investigation of costs, including the overall cost of service, including operating costs and overhead; the allocation of overhead and other administrative and general expenses to the regulated entity; the appropriate capital structure to be utilized in calculating rates; the appropriate rate of return on equity and interest rates on debt; the rate base, including the proper starting rate base; the throughput underlying the rate and the proper allowance for federal and state income taxes.
Pipeline Safety Regulation
Our natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, or NGPSA, and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, or PSIA, as reauthorized and amended by the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006, or the PIPES Act. The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities, while the PSIA establishes mandatory inspections for all U.S. oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in high-consequence areas, or HCAs. Our NGL pipeline is subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, or the HLPSA, which requires PHMSA to develop, prescribe and enforce minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline, and the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, or the PSA, which added the environment to the list of statutory factors that must be considered in establishing safety standards for hazardous liquid pipelines, established safety standards for certain “regulated gathering lines,” and mandated that regulations be issued to establish criteria for operators to use in identifying and inspecting pipelines located in HCAs, defined as those areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage, that cross a navigable waterway, or that have a high population density. In 1996, Congress enacted the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996, or the APSA, which limited the 
6

operator identification requirement to operators of pipelines that cross a waterway where a substantial likelihood of commercial navigation exists, required that certain areas where a pipeline rupture would likely cause permanent or long-term environmental damage be considered in determining whether an area is unusually sensitive to environmental damage, and mandated that regulations be issued for the qualification and testing of certain pipeline personnel. In the PIPES Act, Congress required mandatory inspections for certain U.S. crude oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in HCAs and mandated that regulations be issued for low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines and pipeline control room management.
PHMSA has developed regulations that require pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs. The regulations require operators, including us, to:

• | perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;


• | identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact an HCA;


• | improve data collection, integration and analysis;


• | repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and


• | implement preventive and mitigating actions.

The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, or the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, reauthorized funding for federal pipeline safety programs, increased penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of certain safety issues. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, among other things, increased the maximum civil penalty for pipeline safety violations and directed the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate rules or standards relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation and testing to confirm the material strength of pipe operating above 30% of specified minimum yield strength in HCAs. Effective August 1, 2016, the maximum administrative civil penalties for violation of the pipeline safety laws and regulations increased to $205,638 per violation per day, with a maximum of $2,056,380 for a series of violations. In addition, in March 2015, PHMSA finalized new rules applicable to gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that, among other changes, impose new post-construction inspections, welding, gas component pressure testing requirements, as well as requirements for calculating pressure reductions for immediate repairs on liquid pipelines. More recently, in October 2015, PHMSA proposed changes to its hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations that would significantly extend the integrity management requirements to previously exempt hazardous liquid pipelines and would impose additional obligations on hazardous liquid pipeline operators that are already subject to the integrity management requirements. PHMSA’s proposed rule would also require annual reporting of safety-related conditions and incident reports for all hazardous liquid gathering lines and gravity lines, including pipelines that are currently exempt from PHMSA regulations. PHMSA issued a separate regulatory proposal in July 2015 that would impose pipeline incident prevention and response measures on pipeline operators. PHMSA also recently issued an advisory bulletin providing guidance on verification of records related to pipeline maximum allowable operating pressure and maximum operating pressure. The advisory bulletin advised pipeline operators of anticipated changes in annual reporting requirements and explained that to the extent pipeline operators are relying on design, construction, inspection, testing, or other data to determine the pressures at which their pipelines should operate, the records of that data must be traceable, verifiable and complete. Locating such records and, in the absence of any such records, verifying maximum pressures through physical testing (including hydrotesting) or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the demands of such pressures, could significantly increase our costs on a going forward basis. In April 2016, pursuant to one of the requirements of the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, PHMSA published a proposed rule making that would expand integrity management requirements and impose new pressure testing requirements on currently regulated gas transmission pipelines. The proposal would also significantly expand the regulation of gathering lines, subjecting previously unregulated pipelines to requirements regarding damage prevention, corrosion control, public education programs, maximum allowable operating pressure limits, and other requirements.
Regulations, changes to regulations or an increase in public expectations for pipeline safety may require additional reporting, the replacement of some of our pipeline segments, the addition of monitoring equipment and more frequent inspection or testing of our pipeline facilities. Any repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures. While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations (such as integrity management requirements) to pipelines and gathering lines not previously subject to such requirements. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to become compliant with new requirements, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations. There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate.
States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most are certified by 
7

the DOT to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. States may adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines; however, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. State standards may include requirements for facility design and management in addition to requirements for pipelines. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. Our natural gas pipelines and NGL pipeline have continuous inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements. 
We expect to incorporate all existing requirements into our programs by the required regulatory deadlines, and will continually incorporate the new requirements into procedures and budgets. We expect to incur increasing regulatory compliance costs, based on the intensification of the regulatory environment and upcoming changes to regulations as outlined above. In addition to regulatory changes, costs may be incurred when there is an accidental release of a commodity transported by our system, or a regulatory inspection identifies a deficiency in our required programs.
Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
Our natural gas gathering, processing and transportation activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. As an owner or operator of these facilities, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:

• | requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment, imposing emission or discharge limits or otherwise restricting the way we operate resulting in additional costs to our operations;


• | limiting or prohibiting construction activities in areas, such as air quality nonattainment areas, wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species;


• | delaying system modification or upgrades during review of permit applications and revisions;


• | requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate discharges, releases or pollution conditions associated with our operations or attributable to former operations; and


• | enjoining the operations of facilities deemed to be in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to or regulatory requirements imposed by such environmental laws and regulations.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties and natural resource damages. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, neighboring landowners and other third parties may file common law claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid waste into the environment.
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. As with the midstream industry in general, complying with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations can increase our capital costs to construct, maintain and operate equipment and facilities. While we expect these laws and regulations will affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we believe that the various activities in which we are engaged that are subject to environmental laws and regulations are not expected to materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability to gather natural gas. We cannot assure you, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs. Below is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business.
Hazardous Waste and Site Remediation
Our operations generate solid wastes, including some hazardous wastes, that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state laws, which impose requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste. RCRA currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste. Specifically, RCRA excludes from the definition of hazardous waste produced waters and other wastes intrinsically associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil and natural gas. However, these oil and gas exploration and production wastes may still be regulated under state solid waste laws and regulations, and it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous waste in the future.
8

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released, and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations, such as landfills. We expect that, in the course of our ordinary operations, our operations will generate wastes that may be designated as hazardous substances. CERCLA authorizes the EPA, states and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment and to seek to recover from the classes of responsible persons the costs they incur to address the release. Under CERCLA, we could be subject to strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources.
Hydrocarbons or wastes may be disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for disposal. Such hydrocarbons or wastes may migrate to property adjacent to our owned and leased sites or the disposal sites. In addition, some of the properties may be operated by third parties or by previous owners whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or wastes was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes, including waste disposed of by prior owners or operators; remediate contaminated property, including groundwater contamination, whether from prior owners or operators or other historic activities or spills; or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently a potentially responsible party in any federal or state site remediation and there are no current, pending or anticipated response or remedial activities at or implicating our business and the business of our customers.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act, and comparable state laws, regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including natural gas processing plants and compressor stations, and also impose various emission limits, operational limits and monitoring, reporting and record keeping requirements on air emission sources. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations, and potentially criminal enforcement actions. Such laws and regulations require pre-construction permits for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities with the potential to emit air emissions above certain thresholds. These pre-construction permits generally require use of best available control technology, or BACT, to limit air emissions. We expect that several new and recently proposed EPA new source performance standards, or NSPS, and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants, or NESHAP, will also apply to our facilities and operations. These NSPS and NESHAP standards impose emission limits and operational limits as well as detailed testing, record keeping and reporting requirements on the “affected facilities” covered by these regulations. We may incur capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with complying with existing and recently proposed rules, or with obtaining or maintaining operating permits and complying with federal, state and local regulations related to air emissions. However, we do not believe that such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States, including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers if wetlands are impacted, or a delegated state agency. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from our operations could result in government penalties and civil liability.
Endangered Species
The Endangered Species Act, or ESA, and analogous state laws restrict activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Some of our pipelines may be located in areas that are or may be designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, and previously unprotected species may later be designated as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted. Future construction and expansion activities could also be impacted by the presence of endangered or threatened species. This could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures, delay the completion of projects, or result in limitations on our operating activities that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
Climate Change
In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of greenhouse gases, or GHGs, present an endangerment to 
9

public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to the warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act, that require certain large stationary sources to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, pre-construction permits and Title V operating permits for GHG emissions. Under these regulations, facilities required to obtain PSD permits must meet BACT standards for their GHG emissions. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore oil and natural gas processing and fractionating facilities, which was expanded in October 2015 to include onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting activities and natural gas transmission pipelines. Requiring reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities. Additionally, while Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, the prospect for adoption of significant legislation at the federal level to reduce GHG emissions is perceived to be low at this time. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that limit emissions of GHGs could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that exploration and production operators produce, including our current or future customers, which could thereby reduce demand for our midstream services. In addition, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (“Paris Accord”). The Paris Accord entered into force in November 2016 after over 70 countries, including the United States, ratified the agreement or otherwise indicated their intent to be bound by the agreement. To the extent the United States and other countries implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and gas industry, it could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business.
Finally, increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, it is uncertain if they would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Employees 
We do not have any employees. All of the employees required to conduct and support our operations are employed by Energy Transfer and seconded to our general partner pursuant to the services and secondment agreement described under Item 13 of this annual report. The officers of our general partner manage our operations and activities. As of December 31, 2016, Energy Transfer or its affiliates employed approximately 50 people who provide direct, full-time support to our operations. Energy Transfer considers its relations with such employees to be satisfactory.
Insurance
We share insurance coverage with PennTex Development and we reimburse PennTex Development for the portion of its insurance costs allocated to our assets and business pursuant to the terms of the services and secondment agreement. The PennTex Development insurance program includes general and excess liability insurance, auto liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance and property insurance. We maintain through our general partner director and officer liability insurance for which we reimburse our general partner pursuant to our partnership agreement. Management believes that our insurance coverage is reasonable and appropriate.
