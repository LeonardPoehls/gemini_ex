Item 1.  Business.
History
 
Capital Art, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or “Capital Art”) was originally incorporated on September 20, 2004, in the State of Delaware under the name “Blog8.” Since incorporation we have changed our name numerous times and have been known as “Securiteyes,” “Medify Solutions Limited,” “Patel Incorporated” and “Gleeworks, Inc.” We amended our Certificate of Incorporation and changed our name to Capital Art, Inc. on April 28, 2011.
 
Our principal place of business is located at 6445 South Tenaya Way, Suite B-130, Las Vegas, NV 89113. Our website is www.capitalart.com.
 
Gleeworks, Inc., Acquisition of Capital Art, LLC
 
On May 9, 2011, Gleeworks, Inc. (“Gleeworks”) acquired Capital Art, LLC, pursuant to a business combination (the “Gleeworks Agreement”) whereby the entire outstanding membership interest of Capital Art LLC was exchanged for 7,498,000 shares of common stock of Gleeworks on a one share for two units basis, representing approximately 51% of the issued and outstanding shares of Gleeworks. Prior to the acquisition, Gleeworks operated a business engaged in the apparel industry. As a result, Capital Art, LLC, is now a wholly-owned and operating subsidiary of Capital Art, Inc. We closed the apparel business shortly thereafter.
Current Business
 
We currently are engaged in the business of selling and managing classic and contemporary, limited edition photographic images and reproductions, with a focus on iconic celebrity images, by acquiring ownership or rights to collections of rare iconic negatives and photographs. We also make available images for publications and merchandizing by third parties.
 
Our objective is to become the largest repository of archival pop culture photography in the online world. To this end, we have been and continue to search for photographic archives. We believe the market is unknown and has not been tested, making this business similar to a start-up business. These archives may be purchased outright or we may enter into reproduction or licensing agreements with the owners of the archives. These opportunities are typically (1) photographers who are looking to monetize their archives, or (2) media companies that are either seeking to dispose of the archive or seeking a method to derive revenues from the archive. These opportunities exist both in the United States and abroad, and we continue to search for value wherever it may be geographically located. Our ability to acquire such archives or rights is dependent, however, on our ability to raise additional capital in order to have funds to make such acquisitions. As of the date of this report we do not have any agreement or understanding with any investment banking, venture capital or other entity to provide us with this funding and there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain this funding in the future. Failure to obtain this funding may have a material detrimental impact on our ability to implement our business plan. See “Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources,” below.

Photographic assets are the basis for whatever competitive advantage we may have, and we take steps to protect such assets, including, but not limited to, maintaining insurance to protect against loss or theft of more than five times the actual value.
 
We currently invest our working capital resources in sales and marketing in order to increase the distribution and demand for our products and in adding content to our product along with adding additional channels of distribution, resulting in increases in volumes of goods being sold. As part of increasing our product offerings, we have been and continue to search for photographic archives that can be acquired at wholesale or below market prices. These archives may be acquired purchased or we may enter into reproduction or licensing agreements with the owners of the archives. These opportunities are typically (1) photographers who are looking to monetize their archives, or (2) media companies that are either seeking to dispose of the archive or seeking a method to derive revenues from the archive. 
 
Our business is generated through operations of our three divisions, including:
 

· | Sale of original vintage prints. On May 11, 2015 we entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with a distributor to distribute our vintage original fine art prints to fine art dealers and collector auction houses, as well as private third party collectors. Under the terms of the agreement the distributor receives 50% of the gross receipts from sales generated by it. This distributor accounted for 27% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, the initial year of operations of this division;

Following is a description of the images and reproductions we have acquired to date:
 
Frank Worth Photographic Reproduction and Marketing Rights Agreement
 
On October 10, 2011, we entered into a memorandum of understanding as an interim agreement with the Estate of Frank Worth (the “Frank Worth Estate”) whereby the Frank Worth Estate agreed to exclusively grant us all rights in perpetuity to reproduce prints from Frank Worth negatives and to use of the Frank Worth name, signature and intellectual property in exchange for the payment of $50,000 and a 7.5% royalty on all revenue received by us from the sale of any and all Frank Worth prints, products and use whatsoever of Frank Worth’s name, likeness, story and biography.
 
Subsequently, on November 18, 2011, we and the Frank Worth Estate entered into a Photographic Reproduction and Marketing Rights Agreement (the “Frank Worth Reproduction Rights Agreement”). Pursuant to the Frank Worth Reproduction Rights Agreement, the Frank Worth Estate granted us the exclusive global reproduction rights to all negatives, prints, products and other materials from the Frank Worth collection, including the use of the Frank Worth seal, Frank Worth’s name, likeness, publications and biography, plus merchandising and product selling rights as well as exclusive rights to the signature of the Frank Worth Estate’s executor (the “Executor”) in conjunction with any and all Certificates of Authenticity printed by us that accompany limited edition prints (the “Frank Worth Archive”). In consideration for the exclusive rights, we paid to the Frank Worth Estate a purchase price of $50,000 and agreed to make continuous payments of a monthly royalty amount of 7.5% of all net sales, with an annual minimum guarantee of $50,000. In June 2014, the Frank Worth Estate agreed to a reduced minimum royalty guarantee payment for 2013 and 2014 of $30,000 for each year. The Frank Worth Reproduction Rights Agreement also granted us the right to buyout the exclusive agreement from the Frank Worth Estate at any time for $250,000.
 
On November 12, 2014, the Frank Worth Estate agreed to accept $155,000 and 200,000 shares of our Common Stock in exchange for sole and exclusive, world-wide, royalty free rights to all negatives, prints, products and other materials we possessed including the use of the Frank Worth seal, Frank Worth’s name, likeness, publications and biography plus merchandising and selling rights. We paid $30,000 on execution in January 2015 in connection with November 12, 2014 agreement. The requirement to pay the balance of $125,000 and the requirement to issue 200,000 shares were both eliminated as a result of an arbitration action that was concluded in October 2016. See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.”
 
On October 18, 2016, an arbitration hearing was held on this matter. On October 28, 2016, the arbitrator issued an amended award, finding the 2011 Agreement to remain valid, but also recognizing our demand for clean title to the 38 Key images. Thus, we were ordered to pay Claimant $70,000 as final payment due under the November 12, 2014 agreement, payable to the Claimant no later than February 23, 2017. We were granted an award for delivery of clean title of the 38 Key images no later than February 23, 2017. In the event the Claimant provides such clean title by that deadline, the parties have the option to comply with the 2011 agreement and enter into negotiations for a new royalty agreement on the 38 Key images. In the event Claimant does not deliver clean title, we shall retain possession of the entire collection, including the 38 Key images with no further obligation to pay royalties. Claimant failed to deliver clean title by February 23, 2017.

In the interim, we learned that Claimant is the subject of an action in a California Probate Court action challenging his actions as Executor of the Estate after March 2008.  At that time Claimant was discharged as Executor of the Estate and he had no legal authority from that point on to represent the interests of the Estate, including entering into the agreements that were the subject of the Arbitration.  That information has led us to secure the $70,000 final payment until such time as the California Probate Court determines the appropriate recipient. See “Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings,” below.
 
On February 28, 2017, the parties agreed to dismiss this action with prejudice.
 
Finally, on January 26, 2017, Claimant filed a separate civil suit against us in Nevada District Court. This new suit seeks to vacate the decision of the Arbitrator in the Binding Arbitration.  Claimant is dissatisfied with the results of the Binding Arbitration, notwithstanding his agreement to be bound by the decisions of the Arbitrator. We have challenged whether Claimant has standing to pursue this action because of his lack of status as an Executor, and his lack of any status as a Beneficiary of the Estate. 
 
Movie Star News, LLC, Acquisition
 
On October 8, 2014, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Movie Star News, LLC (“MSN”) pursuant to which we acquired a collection consisting of approximately 100,000 negatives, certain other negatives including the Bettie Page collection and approximately 1 million 8" by 10" Black & White Photographs, including all copyrights owned by MSN for the collection in exchange for 256,400,226 shares of our Common Stock. We have classified this acquisition as a “reverse acquisition” for accounting purposes.
 
After giving effect to the acquisition and the issuance 256,400,226 shares of our Common Stock to the former members of MSN, combined with 42,348,057 shares of Common Stock that were issued and outstanding at the time of this transaction, we had 298,748,283 shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding, resulting in the shareholders of pre-merger CAPA collectively owning approximately 14%, and the former MSN members owning approximately 86%, of our outstanding Common Stock.
 
Acquisition of Globe Photos, Inc. 
 
On July 22, 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Globe Photos, Inc. (“Globe”), a New York corporation, to purchase of substantially all of the assets of Globe, which principally comprised of photographer contracts granting us the right to exploit copyrights, digital and tangible photographs, payable $250,000 in cash and shares of our Common Stock valued at $150,000 (the “Globe Agreement”) to be transferred to Globe sixty (60) days after closing subject to satisfaction of successful termination of certain subagent agreements by Globe.
 
Per the Globe Agreement, $180,000 in cash was held in reserve by us to insure Globe’s full performance and compliance with all terms of the agreement. We began to release monthly payments of $10,000 to Globe beginning August 22, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the total reserve payable to Globe Photos, Inc. was $130,000. This balance was paid off February 23, 2017.
 
The Globe Agreement called for the Common Stock to be transferred to Globe sixty (60) days after closing subject to satisfaction of successful termination of certain subagent agreements by Globe. Globe retained these certain subagent agreements, but was not able to successfully terminate these agreements. As such, the number of shares required to be issued was reduced to 352,941 (valued at $120,000), thereby reducing the total purchase price of the assets acquired from $400,000 to $370,000. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 4.”
 
As a form of liquidity protection the Globe Agreement provides Globe with a a limited put option in connection with the Common Stock issued to it, beginning eighteen (18) months after the closing date (January 2017), whereas we have up to fifteen (15) successive monthly options, with no less than thirty (30) days’ notice for each, which requires us to repurchase from Globe up to 1/15th of the shares of common stock in Globe’s possession (232,529 shares) that were issued, at a price per share equity to the market price per share ($0.34) on the effective date of the original share transfer to Globe. The exercise of any put option is not conditioned upon exercise of any prior put option. To date we have made two payments of $8,000 per payment.

Material Subsequent Events
 
Proceeds from Auctions of Royalty Rights
 
On March 8, 2016, we entered into a Listing Agreement with Royalty Network, LLC, d/b/a Royalty Exchange, for auction of a 50% ownership of photographic copyrights of certain celebrity archival images owned by us. In addition, the sale also assigns the winning bidder the right to receive 50% of the future share of income derived from the assigned images. From April 1 through December 31, 2016, we received gross proceeds of $346,500 from five separate auctions of these rights and retained all exclusive licensing authority over the images. We also have been provided a buyback option to buy back the 50% ownership of the rights for two times the original gross auction proceeds of $792,000 for one to two year periods ranging from August 12, 2017 through November 18, 2018.
 
We provide access to photos that we owned to the auction house, who selects specific photos which will be offered at auction. These selected photos are placed in quarterly HYee auctions, along with other photos owned by the auction house. All photos start at a reserved price of $.99 cents. Bids are made on each piece by customers until the closing day and time. The total amount bid for one of our photos is what the customer agrees to pay for the photo, not including shipping, which is paid to the auction house. We book the full amount paid for our photo as gross revenue on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Pursuant to our agreement the auction house withholds 50% of these gross revenues and issues a payment to us for the remaining 50%
 
Archive Acquisition Agreements 
 
On March 23, 2016, we entered in an agreement to purchase a celebrity photograph archive of 200,000 original vintage prints from Photoshot License Limited, a UK corporation, for total purchase price of $55,000. In addition, we paid a finder’s fee of $10,000 to a consultant in connection with the purchase of the archives. Per the terms of the agreement, the photographs may only be sold as a physical asset and we do not have the right to license the images. As of the date of this Report we believe that the value of these assets exceeds $2 million. This acquisition has provided us with significant diversification of our collectibles.
 
Also, effective June 1, 2016, we entered into three separate non-exclusive license agreements for the use of licensed images and trademarks through December 31, 2019. Under the terms of the agreements, we are required pay a royalty of 10% on net sales. The agreements call for combined annual guaranteed minimum royalties per year of $150,000 based on combined minimum sales of $1,500,000 per year. We were was required to pay advances related to 50% of the first year’s royalties totaling $75,000 upon execution of the agreements. In February 2017 we paid for two of these licenses for $25,000. We intend to pay the balance of $50,000 in March 2017.
 
These acquisitions were the Authentic Brands Licensing Agreements for worldwide licenses from the Marilyn Monroe Estate, the Elvis Presley Estate and the Muhammad Ali estate. These licenses allow us to use these icons names and likenesses which allows us to being our product lines into mass retail.
 
Products and Services
 
We offer our customers a variety of photographic images in different mediums such as select photographs that are limited in the number of copies, each copy with a unique number and certificate of authenticity signed by the Frank Worth Estate, with a premium price and mass reproductions of different photographic negatives sold at a lower price.
 
Our customers operate in a variety of industries, such as galleries, hotels, magazines and other publications, interior decorating and direct to consumers through third party online merchandising companies.
 
We work with different third party manufacturers and suppliers to produce our photographic products.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
We do not have an in-house sales staff. We reach our customers through diverse marketing channels, including our website, events and interactive campaigns. Marketing activities aim to build awareness for our brands and drive revenue by promoting newly acquired images as well as images existing in our collection.
 
As of the date of this Report we are in the process of setting up individual divisions to target the Interior Design industry, the Fund Raising industry and the Hospitality industry. We have exhibited at the World Market Place tradeshow twice in the past three years. Currently only a small percentage of our revenues is associated with these divisions. However, while no assurances can be provided, we expect significant growth over the next 3-5 years through interactive campaigns conducted with up to 50 unaffiliated online retainers, including 1stdibs and other targeted niche websites like art.com, paddle8.com, artnet.com and others.
 
We sell our photographic images and reproductions through third-party galleries, art consultants, interior decorators and directly to consumers. We also reproduce mass quantities of different photographs from our collection, which are sold through third party on-line retailers.
 
We have several websites, each targeted to specific consumers including high-end fine art, and lower end open edition prints. We have identified over 50 3rd party online retailers that we can sell through and give a percentage of sales to each of the online retailers. These percentages usually average around 20%. We have several programs currently in place with websires including 1st dibs, stylemined, Lumas, art net and others and expect to expand these sales over the first 2 quarters of 2017. We have been targeting these sales channels for the past 2 years.
 
We expect to continue to pursue contracts to diversify revenues, and to develop additional websites for retail clients to purchase our prints, but also as a portal for our interior decorator, third party gallery and charity partners. The downside is that there are a limited number of interior decorators, galleries and charity partners which produce higher revenues than on-line sales, and while we actively pursue such contracts, our success will depend upon our ability to obtain such contracts for sales and also upon our ability to acquire a larger depository.
 
In November 2014 we entered into an agreement with Fiero LLC (“Fiero”) to have Fiero build a website that will act not only as a site for retail clients to purchase our prints, but also as a portal for our interior decorator, third party gallery and charity partners. The agreement provided for Fiero to provide website design, development, content management systems, ecommerce and auction integration and administration that includes behavioral design infrastructure and data integration with our internal systems. The agreement also provided for post-production support, hosting service, site monitoring and reporting functions. The total cost was $193,000, including a cash payment of $40,000 and the issuance of 510,000 shares of our Common Stock. Fiero ceased operations in December 2016, prior to fulfilling their obligations under the agreement. As of December 31, 2015, 170,000 shares of these common shares had been issued. Subsequently, we issued an additional 229,300 shares, leaving, leaving 110,700 shares unissued. We subsequently retained High Touch Solutions to handle our website design work. They do not charge to develop websites, but charges a monthly fee of $80 once the website is set up and approved. This fee includes service and support and we feel individual niche websites are the way to go moving forward.
 
On January 1, 2015, we entered in a 12-month agreement for non-exclusive investment banking advisory services with Vista Partners for total consideration of 2,000,000 shares of our Common Stock. The agreement was subsequently extended additional 6-months with no other changes to the terms of the original agreement. The shares were payable within 14 days of the effective date of the agreement and deemed earned in full upon execution of the agreement. The shares were issued in May 2015. The agreement may be renewed for an additional 12-month term whereby we, in our sole discretion, may elect to pay the investment banking advisor $400,000 cash or an equivalent amount in shares of our common stock based upon the thirty day volume weighted average price for thirty trading days prior to renewal. We have no intention of extending this agreement.
 
We are exploring the possibility of opening company-owned galleries in Las Vegas and other major cities like Los Angeles. However, as of the date of this report we have no definitive plans or arrangements with respect to operating galleries. We are adding relationships with third party galleries, websites and interior decorators that can sell our images to their clients. We are also creating a charity sales plan whereby charities can use our photos for fund raising activities. We intend to make over 3 million images available for publication on a world-wide basis for print and digital licensing where we would be paid royalties when our photographs are used. We are also exploring the possibility of forming partnerships with major companies who can sell our prints to their client base on a revenue-split basis. These companies include Art.com and other online and bricks and mortar companies. There are no assurances these efforts will be successful.

Competition
 
Most of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. The market for iconic photographic images and related services is highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors include name recognition, company reputation, the quality, relevance and breadth of the content in a company’s collections and the quality of contributing photographers and other partners under contract with a company. Additionally, we also face competition in connection with factors relating to the business and our infrastructure such as effective use of current and emerging technology, customer service and customer relationships, pricing and licensing models, policies and practices and accessibility of content and speed and ease of search and fulfillment.
 
Some of our current and potential significant competitors include other general visual content providers such as Corbis Corporation. We also face significant competition from specialized visual content companies that are well established in their local, content or product-specific market segments such as Reuters Group, the Associated Press, and ZUMA Press, Inc.
 
There are also hundreds, if not thousands, of small photography agencies, image content aggregators and individual photographers throughout the world with whom we compete.
 
Our competition includes retail photography galleries and websites selling photography such as art.com, artspace.com and rockpaperphoto.com. We believe that we are highly competitive because we own our photographic negatives and do not have to split sales proceeds with photographers who own their intellectual property rights, which is the industry standard. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
Most of our collection of iconic photographic images were acquired and are owned by us. A small percentage of the images in our collection are obtained through reproduction or licensing agreements, wherein we pay a royalty based on the percentage of revenues we receive from the use of the licensed images. As such, currently such agreements are limited and not material.
 
To this end, we have been and continue to search for photographic archives. We believe that our successes over the past 18 months that these archives can be monetized multiple ways, through our collectibles, licensing and retail divisions, depending upon the structure and content of each archive. These archives may be purchased outright or we may enter into reproduction or licensing agreements with the owners of the archives. These opportunities are typically (1) photographers who are looking to monetize their archives, or (2) media companies that are either seeking to dispose of the archive or seeking a method to derive revenues from the archive. These opportunities exist both in the United States and abroad and we continue to search for value wherever it may be geographically located.
 
Our management believes that the market is significantly undervaluing physical photographic assets for both individual photographers seeking to monetize their collections and media companies seeking to dispose of their archives because of the investment required to digitize and then monetize them. We have created an infrastructure and workflow process in order to digitize these assets at a low cost which we believe gives us a competitive advantage for purchasing from all sources.
 
We utilize the following criteria when evaluating archives:
 

· | The age of the archives;
--+-------------------------


· | How/If the archive is organized;
--+---------------------------------


· | The type of media in the archive;
--+----------------------------------


· | The subject matter of the archive;
--+-----------------------------------


· | The rarity of the subject matter;
--+----------------------------------


· | The photographer(s) represented in the archive; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | The nature and the strength of the rights associated with the archive.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In this respect single photographer archives are desirable because copyrights are often easily ascertained to be owned by the photographer. We can market and build the reputation of the photographer to enhance the value of the archive. In addition, we believe we can better control the market for the works of individual photographers. Reproduction and licensing agreements are often more desirable because they typically require low or no upfront cash commitments. In these agreements content providers are usually paid mostly through royalties on sales. Owning copyright or having rights to copyrights significantly impact our gross margins. On the other hand, purchasing copyrights outright while reducing cash, increases intangible assets and generates higher gross margins. Reproduction and licensing agreements do not significantly impact our balance sheet but generate much lower gross margins.
 
Our ability to acquire such depository is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital in order to have funds to make such acquisitions. See “Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion – Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had 7 and 6 employees, respectively, of which 5 were full-time, including one marketing person, an office manager, 2 scanners and management. We also utilize consultants on an as needed basis. None of our employees are members of any union. We believe our relationship with our employees is excellent.
Government Regulations
 
We are not subject to any extraordinary governmental regulations.
 
Emerging Growth Company
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:

· | have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency;” and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
 
We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
