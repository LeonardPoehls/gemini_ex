 Coastway Community Bank 
         Coastway Community Bank is a Rhode Island chartered savings bank headquartered in Warwick, Rhode Island. Coastway Community Bank was originally organized in 1920 as the Telephone Workers Credit Union, a Rhode Island credit union, and later we changed our name to Coastway Credit Union. In 2000, Coastway Credit Union merged with Ocean State Community Credit Union, also located in Rhode Island. In 2009, in order to give us greater business lending authority, Coastway Credit Union converted to a Rhode Island chartered mutual savings bank and changed its name to Coastway Community Bank. In 2013, we reorganized into the mutual holding company structure by forming Coastway Bancorp, MHC, a Rhode Island chartered mutual holding company which was eliminated in January, 2014 when we completed our initial public offering. 
         We provide financial services to individuals, families and businesses throughout Rhode Island from our nine banking offices located in Providence County and Kent County, Rhode Island. Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market area and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, commercial real estate loans, U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA") loans and, to a lesser extent, commercial business loans, commercial construction loans and consumer loans. We sell in the secondary market the majority of the fixed-rate conforming one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate, and depending on market conditions, we may also sell the guaranteed portions of SBA loans that we originate. We offer a variety of deposit accounts to consumers and small businesses, including certificate of deposit accounts, savings accounts, demand deposit accounts, money market accounts and club accounts. We utilize national market certificates of deposit and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston both to fund loan growth and for additional liquidity. We also offer online and mobile banking services. Our website address is www.coastway.com. Information on our website is not incorporated into this annual report and should not be considered part of this annual report. 
   Market Area 
         We conduct our operations from our main office and nine full-service banking offices in Rhode Island. Our primary deposit market includes the areas surrounding our banking offices in Providence and Kent Counties, Rhode Island. Our primary lending market includes Providence and Kent Counties, greater Rhode Island and nearby communities in the states of Connecticut and Massachusetts.

   However, we occasionally make loans secured by properties located outside of our primary lending market, usually to borrowers with whom we have an existing relationship and who have a presence within our primary market. 
         Rhode Island is a relatively well-developed state that has a wide range of industries. Rhode Island's historical economy was based on industries such as textiles, jewelry, silverware, metals/machinery and footwear/rubber products. The access to the Atlantic Ocean resulted in the establishment of military bases and other military-related industries and employment. Over time manufacturing and other labor intensive industries have declined in Rhode Island and have been replaced by a more service-oriented economy. In recent decades, health care, financial services, defense industry, tourism and gambling have become more important segments of the local economy. Notable firms headquartered in Rhode Island include CVS Pharmacy, Textron, Hasbro and Amica Insurance. Rhode Island is also a center of higher education, with Brown University, the University of Rhode Island, Johnson & Wales University and Bryant University. The U.S. Navy has had a significant presence in the Newport area, through the Naval Station at Newport and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center. 
         Unemployment has stabilized in Rhode Island with unemployment rates of 4.4% for the entire state, 4.6% for Providence County and 3.9% for Kent County as compared to the national rate of 4.1% as of December 2017. The median household income for 2012-2016 in Rhode Island was $58,000, in Providence County it was $51,000 and in Kent County it was $66,000, as compared to the national median of $55,000. 
         According to the latest U.S. Census estimates, Rhode Island reported a population of 1.1 million as of July 1, 2017, while the Providence metropolitan statistical area (which includes contiguous portions of Massachusetts and Connecticut), contained a total population of 1.6 million. Rhode Island recorded a 0.6% increase in population from April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2017, and the Providence metropolitan statistical area also recorded a 0.1% increase in population. Providence County, the location of seven of our branch offices, had a population of 634,000 as of July 1, 2016 and recorded an increase in population of 1.1% from April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2016. Kent County, the location of two of our branch offices, reported a population of 165,000 as of July 1, 2016 and recorded a slight population decrease of 0.9% over the same time period. The United States as a whole recorded an increase of 4.7% in total population from April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2016 and an increase of 5.5% in total population from April 15, 2010 to July 1, 2017. 
   Competition 
         We face significant competition within our market both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as trust services and private banking. Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. 
         As of June 30, 2017 (the latest date for which information is available), our deposit market share was 1.59% for the State of Rhode Island, with 1.17% of total deposits in Providence County, Rhode Island and 6.93% in Kent County, Rhode Island respectively, making us the 8th largest out of 17 financial institutions in Providence County and the 6th largest out of 12 financial institutions in Kent County. We have been one of the top five SBA lenders in the State of Rhode Island in terms of dollars lent and number of loans originated for the last ten years.

     Lending Activities 
         Our principal lending activity is originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, commercial real estate loans, SBA loans and, to a lesser extent, commercial business loans, commercial construction loans and consumer loans. We also sell in the secondary market the majority of the fixed-rate conforming one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate, generally on a servicing-released, limited or no recourse basis, while retaining jumbo fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to manage the duration and time to re-pricing of our loan portfolio. During 2017 and 2016, we purchased individual loans totaling $43.8 million and $17.6 million at a cost of $44.4 million and $17.8 million, respectively, of one- to four-family residential real estate loans from third party originators, which the Bank underwrote in accordance with the Bank's lending policy prior to purchase. In recent years, we have increased and, subject to market conditions and our asset-liability analysis, expect to continue to increase commercial real estate and commercial business lending. Depending on market conditions, we may also sell the guaranteed portions of SBA loans that we originate. We sold $4.2 million of SBA loans for a gain on sale of $328,000 in 2015. There were no sales of SBA loans during 2017 and 2016. 
  Loan Portfolio Composition.    The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio, by type of loan at the dates indicated, excluding the carrying value of loans held for sale of $11.1 million, $23.2 million, $19.0 million, $11.0 million, and $8.6 million at December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

 One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Lending.    At December 31, 2017, we had $312.1 million of loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, representing 50.9% of our total loan portfolio. In addition, at December 31, 2017, we had $11.1 million of residential mortgages held for sale at fair value. We primarily originate fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans, but depending on market conditions and borrower preferences, we also offer adjustable-rate loans. At December 31, 2017, 83.6% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans were fixed-rate loans, and 16.4% of such loans were adjustable-rate loans. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, $96.8 million and $67.5 million of one-to four-family residential real estate loans were purchased from third parties, respectively, which are located in New England, primarily in Massachusetts. 
         Our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans typically have terms of 10 to 30 years and are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, VA, FHA or Rhode Island Housing guidelines and when the loan balance meets such guidelines, we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as "conforming loans." We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which as of December 31, 2017 was generally $424,100 for single-family homes in our market area. We typically sell servicing-released the majority of our fixed-rate conforming loans. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, proceeds from the sale of one- to four-family residential real estate loans held for sale were $228.3 million and $219.0 million, respectively. We also originate loans above the lending limit for conforming loans, which are referred to as "jumbo loans" that we retain in our portfolio. Jumbo loans that we originate typically have 15 to 
 7

   30 year terms and maximum loan-to-value ratios of 95%. At December 31, 2017, we had $236.4 million in jumbo loans, which represented 75.8% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Our average loan size for jumbo loans was $603,000 at December 31, 2017. We also offer FHA, USDA and VA loans, all of which we originate for sale on a servicing-released, non-recourse basis in accordance with FHA, USDA and VA guidelines. Virtually all of our one- to four-family originated residential real estate loans are secured by properties located in our market area. 
         We generally limit the loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios of our mortgage loans without private mortgage insurance to 80% of the sales price or appraised value, whichever is lower. Loans where the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance ("PMI") may be made with loan-to-value ratios up to 97%. From time to time we may originate mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios greater than 80% with no private mortgage insurance. Such loans totaled $47.3 million and $37.0 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively or 15.1% and 14.8% of one- to four-family mortgage loans, and have an average loan-to-value ratio of 85% at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Of the $47.3 million in residential loans with a greater than 80% LTV ratio at December 31, 2017, $32.0 million or 66.4% are jumbo loans. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we originated $18.6 million of one- to four-family loans with a greater than 80% loan-to-value ratio with no PMI at an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we originated $9.7 million of one- to four-family loans with a greater than 80% loan-to-value ratio with no PMI at an average loan-to-value ratio of 87%. The Bank considers the incremental credit risk on these loans as compared to the remaining residential mortgage portfolio as a component of its concentration qualitative reserve factor. Impaired loans at December 31, 2017 included $1.3 million, or 2.7% of the loans with a greater than 80% LTV ratio and no PMI. 
         Our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans carry terms to maturity ranging from 10 to 30 years and generally have fixed rates for initial terms of five years, although we also offer terms of one, two, three, seven or ten years, and adjust annually thereafter at a margin, which in recent years has been tied to a margin above the LIBOR rate. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 5% for the first adjustment period and 2% per adjustment period thereafter, with a lifetime interest rate cap of generally 5% over the initial interest rate of the loan. We typically hold in portfolio our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans. 
         Although adjustable-rate mortgage loans may reduce to an extent our vulnerability to changes in market interest rates because they periodically re-price, as interest rates increase the required payments due from the borrower also increase (subject to rate caps), increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustments of the contractual interest rate are also limited by our maximum periodic and lifetime rate adjustments. Moreover, the interest rates on most of our adjustable-rate loans do not adjust until five to seven years after origination. As a result, the effectiveness of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in compensating for changes in general interest rates may be limited during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. 
         We offer on a limited basis one- to four-family residential real estate loans secured by non-owner occupied properties, which are generally originated for sale. 
         From 2000 until early 2006, we originated loans to borrowers who provided limited or no documentation of income, known as stated income loans. A stated income loan is a loan where the borrower's income source is not subject to verification through the application process. At December 31, 2017, we had $2.1 million in stated income loans, or 0.7% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio, of which $347,000 was non-performing loans and $525,000 were accruing troubled debt restructured loans. Subsequent to 2006, we have not and we have no intention of originating stated income loans again in the future. Approximately 38.0% of the $2.1 million in stated income loans were made to borrowers who had existing commercial relationships and financial information on file with us. 
 8

          
        We do not offer "interest only" mortgage loans on permanent one- to four-family residential real estate loans (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as "Option ARM" loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not have a "subprime lending" program for one- to four-family residential real estate loans (i.e., loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories). 
         All residential mortgage loans that we originate include "due-on-sale" clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that, among other things, the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance for the benefit of Coastway Community Bank. We also require homeowner's insurance and fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance on properties securing real estate loans. 
  Commercial Real Estate Lending.    Consistent with our strategy to diversify our loan portfolio and increase our yield, we are focused on increasing our origination of commercial real estate loans, with a target loan size of $250,000 to $7.0 million. At December 31, 2017, we had $156.0 million in commercial real estate loans, representing 25.5% of our total loan portfolio. 
         Our commercial real estate loans generally have initial terms of five to ten years and amortization terms of 15 to 20 years, with a balloon payment at the end of the initial term, and may be fixed-rate or adjustable-rate. Our adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans are generally tied to a margin above the five year Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston rate. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our commercial real estate loans is generally 75% (80% for multi-family) of the lower of cost or appraised value of the property securing the loan. Our commercial real estate loans are typically secured by medical, retail, industrial, warehouse, service, or other commercial properties. We originate a limited number of multi-family loans generally secured by apartment buildings. At December 31, 2017, we had $66.7 million of non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, with an average loan size of $429,000. 
         Coastway Community Bank is also qualified to make SBA loans. Loans are originated generally under the 7(a) (SBA Advantage Loan Program) and 504 (SBA Grow Loan Program). See "SBA Loans" below for a discussion of the 7(a) program. The SBA 504 program is an economic development program which finances the expansion of small businesses. We generally originate SBA 504 loans for commercial real estate in which we generally provide 50% of the projected costs on a long-term basis (initially up to 90% may be provided, pending repayment from SBA-backed debentures), secured by a first lien on the real property as collateral. At December 31, 2017, we had $16.5 million in SBA 504 loans, or 10.6% of our commercial real estate loans. 
         At December 31, 2017, the average loan size of our outstanding commercial real estate loans was $416,000, and the largest of such loans was a $5.7 million loan which is primarily secured by five properties located in Providence, Rhode Island, three of which are multi-family and are non-owner occupied. This loan was performing in accordance with its original terms at December 31, 2017. The Bank's total relationship of commercial real estate loans with this borrower was $7.8 million at December 31, 2017. 
         We consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including project-level and global cash flows, credit history, and management expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower's experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower's payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service 
 9

   and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service). We generally require a debt service ratio of at least 1.20x. The collateral securing commercial real estate loans of $250,000 or more are appraised by outside independent appraisers. 
         Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of commercial real estate loans. We require property and casualty insurance and flood insurance if the property is determined to be in a flood zone area. 
         Commercial real estate loans entail greater credit risks compared to one- to four-family residential real estate loans because they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial real estate than residential properties. 
  Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit.    In addition to traditional one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, we offer home equity loans and lines of credit that are secured by the borrower's primary or secondary residence. At December 31, 2017, we had $71.8 million, or 11.7% of our total loan portfolio in home equity loans and lines of credit. Home equity lines of credit totaled $62.0 million at December 31, 2017. At that date we also had $58.3 million of unused commitments related to home equity lines of credit. 
         Home equity loans and lines of credit are generally underwritten using the same criteria that we use to underwrite one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Home equity loans and lines of credit may be underwritten with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 80% when combined with the principal balance of the existing first mortgage loan. Our home equity loans are primarily originated with fixed rates of interest with terms of up to 15 years. Our home equity lines of credit are originated with adjustable-rates based on the prime rate of interest plus an applicable margin and require interest paid monthly. Home equity loans and lines of credit are generally available in amounts of between $5,000 and $2.0 million. 
         Home equity loans and lines of credit secured by junior mortgages have greater risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans secured by first mortgages. At December 31, 2017, $39.6 million of our home equity loans and lines of credit were in a junior lien position, with an average loan size of $39,000. We face the risk that the collateral will be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses and costs of foreclosure, after repayment of the senior mortgages, if applicable. When customers default on their loans, we attempt to foreclose on the property and resell the property as soon as possible to minimize foreclosure and carrying costs. However, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from those customers. Particularly with respect to our home equity loans and lines of credit, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect our ability to fully recover the loan balance in the event of a default. 
  SBA Loans.    We also offer commercial business and commercial real estate loans utilizing the SBA's 7(a) (SBA Advantage Loan Program). At December 31, 2017, we had $41.0 million of SBA loans, representing 6.7% of our total loan portfolio. Under this SBA program, we generally originate and fund loans that currently qualify for guarantees on up to 85% of principal and accrued interest up to a maximum SBA guarantee of $3.75 million per borrower and related entities. We are a preferred lending provider and accordingly can determine SBA eligibility for a loan without prior SBA approval. We do not treat the SBA guarantee as a substitute for a borrower meeting reasonable credit standards. 
 10

   SBA guarantees are generally sought on loans that exhibit minimum capital levels, a short time in business, lower collateral coverage or maximum loan terms beyond our normal underwriting criteria. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we originated $6.9 million, $9.7 million, $6.7 million, $12.9 million and $5.8 million, respectively of loans under the 7(a) program. In addition, the guaranteed portion of the credit can be sold in the secondary market, servicing retained, generating significant gain on sale and fee income opportunities. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013, we sold $4.2 million and $2.5 million of loans under the 7(a) program, generating gains on sale of $328,000 and $159,000, respectively. We did not sell any SBA loans during 2017, 2016 and 2014. Our largest SBA loan at December 31, 2017 had a balance of $4.5 million, is secured by a hotel in Danvers, Massachusetts and has a 32% guarantee by the SBA for $1.4 million. The loan is performing in accordance with its terms at December 31, 2017. 
         Commercial Business Lending.    At December 31, 2017, we had $17.2 million of commercial business loans and lines of credit, representing 2.8% of our total loan portfolio. We originate commercial business loans and lines of credit secured by non-real estate business assets. These loans are generally originated to small businesses in our primary market area. Our commercial business loans are generally used for working capital purposes or for acquiring equipment, inventory or furniture, and are primarily secured by business assets other than real estate, such as business equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. Our commercial business loans are generally term loans with terms of three to seven years and lines of credit with terms of one to two years, with a target loan size of $250,000 to $5.0 million. Our commercial business lines of credit are generally priced on an adjustable-rate basis tied to the prime rate. Term loans are generally priced at a spread over the comparable term Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston rate. We generally obtain personal guarantees with commercial business loans. 
         At December 31, 2017, the average loan size of our outstanding commercial business loans and lines of credit was $181,000, and the largest outstanding commercial loan relationship balance was a $3.6 million loan secured by business assets of a shipyard. This loan was performing in accordance with its original terms at December 31, 2017. 
         We typically originate commercial business loans on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's business, the experience and stability of the borrower's management team, earnings projections and their underlying assumptions, and the value and marketability of any collateral securing the loan. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment in our market area. Therefore, commercial business loans that we originate have greater credit risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans. In addition, commercial business loans often result in larger outstanding balances to single borrowers, or related groups of borrowers, and also generally require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts. 
  Commercial Construction Loans.    At December 31, 2017, we had $13.6 million, or 2.2% of our total loan portfolio, in commercial construction loans. Our commercial construction loans generally have initial terms of up to 12 months, during which the borrower pays interest only. Upon completion of construction, these loans convert to permanent loans. Our commercial construction loans are initially priced on an adjustable-rate basis tied to the prime rate and upon conversion to a permanent loan, rates and terms are comparable to commercial real estate loans that we originate. The maximum loan-to-value of our commercial construction loans is generally 80% of the lesser of the appraised value of the completed property or the contract price for the land plus the value of the improvements, and ranges from 50% to 80% depending on the collateral and the purpose of the improvements upon completion of construction. Commercial construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating permanent commercial real estate loans. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, Coastway Community Bank requires detailed cost estimates to complete the project and an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. Coastway 
 11

   Community Bank also reviews and inspects each property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. Loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection based on the percentage of completion method. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance, property and casualty insurance, and, if the property is determined to be located in a flood zone area, flood insurance. At December 31, 2017, the unadvanced portion of total construction loans totaled $7.4 million. At December 31, 2017, our largest construction loan relationship had a balance of $3.0 million to construct 28 industrial/commercial condominiums in East Greenwich, Rhode Island and was performing in accordance with its original terms. 
         Construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. Construction loans also expose us to the risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated. 
  Consumer Lending.    To a much lesser extent, we offer a variety of consumer loans to individuals who reside or work in our market area, including new and used automobile loans, boat loans, recreational vehicle loans and loans secured by certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2017, our consumer loan portfolio totaled $1.2 million, or 0.2% of our total loan portfolio. At this date, $224,000 of our consumer loans were unsecured. 
         Consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities. 
         Consumer and other loans generally have greater risk compared to longer-term loans secured by improved, owner-occupied real estate, particularly consumer loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. As a result, consumer loan collections are primarily dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. 
   Originations, Sales and Purchases of Loans 
         Most of our loan originations are generated by our loan personnel operating at our corporate headquarters and banking office locations, including loan offices. All loans we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. While we originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon relative borrower demand and the pricing levels as set in the local marketplace by competing banks, thrifts, credit unions, and mortgage banking companies. Our volume of real estate loan originations is influenced significantly by market interest rates, and, accordingly, the volume of our real estate loan originations can vary from period to period. 
         Consistent with our interest rate risk strategy, in the low interest rate environment that has existed in recent years, we have sold on a servicing-released basis a majority of the fixed-rate conforming one- to four-family residential mortgage loans that we have originated. In addition, based upon market conditions, we may sell the guaranteed portion of the SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market. We 
 12

   consider our balance sheet as well as market conditions on an ongoing basis in making decisions as to whether to hold loans we originate for investment or to sell such loans to investors, choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint. We sold $4.2 million in SBA loans for the year ended December 31, 2015. We did not sell any SBA loans during 2017 and 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, proceeds from the sale of residential one- to four-family real estate loans were $228.3 million and $219.0 million, respectively. 
         From time to time, we may purchase loan participations secured by properties and/or assets within and outside of our primary lending market area in which we are not the lead lender. In these circumstances, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies. At December 31, 2017, we had eight loans totaling $13.1 million in which we were not the lead lender and which are performing in accordance with their original terms. We also have participated out portions of loans that exceeded our loans-to-one borrower legal lending limit and for risk diversification. 
         We purchased $43.8 million, $17.6 million, $56.7 million and $11.9 million of individual one- to four-family residential loans from third party originators at a purchase price of $44.4 million, $17.8 million, $57.4 million and $12.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
   Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 
         Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures approved by our board of directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower's ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower's ability to repay, our policies provide for the review of the borrower's employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower. We will also evaluate a guarantor when a guarantee is provided as part of the loan. 
         Coastway Community Bank's policies and loan approval limits are established by our board of directors. Residential real estate and secured consumer loans of up to $250,000 may be approved by senior officers at branch locations and up to $1.0 million must be approved by our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Retail Officer or Senior Vice President, Branch Banking Manager. Residential real estate and secured consumer loans exceeding $1.0 million must be approved by our Credit Committee, consisting of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Retail Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Senior Credit Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Business Lending Officer. All commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans require two approvals. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans up to $250,000 may be approved by the Business Lending Manager, up to $500,000 must be approved by either the Chief Business Lending Officer or the Chief Retail Officer, up to $1.0 million must be approved by the Chief Executive Officer and up to 80% of our legal lending limit rounded to the nearest quarter million must be approved by the Credit Committee. Any loan that exceeds the internal lending limit must be approved by the board of directors. 
   Delinquencies and Non-Performing Assets 
  Delinquency Procedures.    When a borrower fails to make a required monthly payment on a residential real estate loan, we attempt to contact the borrower to determine the reason for nonpayment and to discuss future payments. Our policies provide that a late notice be sent when a loan is 31 days past due. Once the loan is 45 days past due, a Notice of Default and Mortgagee's Right to Foreclosure is sent to the borrower explaining that Coastway Community Bank will initiate foreclosure proceedings on the loan in 45 days or take any legal action necessary to satisfy the obligation if payment is not received. If the loan is reinstated, foreclosure proceedings will be discontinued and the borrower will be permitted to continue to make payments. In certain instances, we may modify the loan or grant a limited exemption from loan payments to allow the borrower to 
 13

   reorganize his or her financial affairs. Loan modifications are evaluated to determine if they should be classified as troubled debt restructurings if concessions are granted due to borrower financial difficulty. We attempt to work with borrowers to establish a repayment schedule that will cure the delinquency. 
         Delinquent commercial real estate and commercial business loans are initially handled by the loan officer responsible for the origination of the loan in conjunction with the Commercial Collections Department immediately upon such loan becoming ten days past due. Our collections department works with the loan officer to ensure that the necessary steps are taken to collect on delinquent loans, including the mailing of delinquency notices. A senior lending officer or the Collections Department Manager takes over any delinquent loan once the loan is 30 days past due and handles any additional collection procedures, including letters from our attorneys. If we cannot reach an acceptable workout of a delinquent commercial real estate or commercial business loan between 30 and 60 days following the due date of the first missed payment, we generally initiate foreclosure or repossession proceedings on any collateral securing the loan. 
         When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as foreclosed real estate until it is sold. The real estate is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of acquisition less estimated costs to sell, and any write-down resulting from the acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Any gains on transfer to foreclosed real estate at fair value are first recorded as a recovery of previous charge-offs and any remaining amount would be recorded in income. Estimated fair value is based on a new appraisal which is obtained as soon as practicable, typically after the foreclosure process is completed. Subsequent decreases in the value of the property are charged to operations. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.

        At December 31, 2017, of the $1.5 million of delinquent SBA loans, guaranteed portions amounted to $1.1 million. Commercial real estate loans 30-59 days totaled $1.4 million at December 31, 2017, of which the largest loan totaling $759,000 became current subsequent to year end. 
         Non-Performing Loans.    We generally cease accruing interest on our loans when contractual payments of principal or interest have become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan may remain on accrual status after becoming 90 days or more past due if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Interest received on nonaccrual loans generally is applied against principal or interest and is recognized on a cash basis. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. 
         Non-performing loans, increased $83,000 to $4.7 million, but improved to 0.77% of total loans, at December 31, 2017 from $4.7 million, or 0.89% of total loans, at December 31, 2016. The increase in non-performing loans was due to a $506,000 increase in non-performing SBA loans to $524,000 at December 31, 2017, of which guaranteed portions amounted to $276,000. Partially offsetting the increase in SBA non-performing loans, was a $277,000 decrease in non-performing one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and a $162,000 decrease in non-performing home equity loans and lines. The improvement in the non-performing loan to total loan ratio was principally due to loan growth in 2017. Non-performing loans increased $413,000 to $4.7 million at December 31, 2016 from $4.2 million at December 31, 2015 due to a $594,000 increase in non-performing one- to four-family residential loans and a $269,000 increase in home equity loans and lines, partially offset by a $449,000 decrease in non-performing SBA loans. 
         Non-performing one- to four-family residential real estate loans totaled $3.4 million at December 31, 2017 and consisted of 13 loans of which the largest was $735,000. Non-performing home equity loans and lines of credit totaled $573,000 at December 31, 2017, and consisted of 10 loans of which the largest was $267,000. 
         Troubled Debt Restructurings.    Loans are classified as restructured when certain modifications are made to the loan terms and concessions are granted to the borrowers due to financial difficulty experienced by those borrowers. The modification of the terms of such loans were one of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan for some period of time, an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, or an extension of time to make payments with the delinquent payments added to the principal of the loan. No additional loan commitments were outstanding to our troubled debt restructured borrowers at December 31, 2017. 
         Loans on non-accrual status at the date of modification are initially classified as non-accrual troubled debt restructurings. At December 31, 2017, we had $2.8 million in non-accruing troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs"). At December 31, 2016, we had $2.6 million in non-accruing TDRs. Our policy provides that troubled debt restructured loans are returned to accrual status after a period of satisfactory and reasonable payment performance under the terms of the restructuring and continued payment is reasonably assured. Satisfactory payment performance is generally no less than six consecutive months of timely payments. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had $5.4 million, $8.3 million and $3.5 million in accruing troubled debt restructurings, respectively. The $4.9 million increase in accruing TDRs during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a $4.0 million commercial real estate loan which was moved to accruing troubled debt restructured status based on extensions of the loan maturity date as the borrower was experiencing financial difficulty. The collateral for this loan was foreclosed upon during the year ended December 31, 2017 and is now 
 16

   included in foreclosed real estate which is the primary reason for the decrease in accruing TDRs for the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, six loans totaling $4.8 million that were modified as troubled debt restructurings within the previous twelve months defaulted after their restructure, $4.0 million of which was transferred to foreclosed real estate. 
  Nonperforming Assets.    The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated. For the dates presented, there were no loans delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing.

           On February 20, 2018, the Bank entered into a Purchase & Sale Agreement to sell the $4.2 million in foreclosed real estate for $4.4 million noted above. The sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. In addition to the non-performing assets above, the Bank had two properties classified as real estate held for sale with a carrying value of $3.3 million and $3.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, both of which were under Purchase & Sale Agreements at December 31, 2015. The sale of the two real estate held for sale properties closed during the first quarter of 2016. There is no real estate held for sale at December 31, 2017 and 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, gross interest income which would have been recorded had the non-performing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to $182,000 and $203,000, respectively. The amount that was included in interest income on such loans totaled $179,000 and $135,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
         Foreclosed Real Estate.    When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as foreclosed real estate until it is sold. The real estate is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of acquisition less estimated costs to sell, and any write-down resulting from the acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Any gains on transfer to foreclosed real estate at fair value are first recorded as a recovery of previous charge-offs and any remaining amount would be recorded in income. Estimated fair value is based on a new appraisal which is obtained as soon as practicable, typically after the foreclosure process is completed. Subsequent decreases in the value of the property are charged to operations. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. During the year ended December 31, 2017, one loan totaling $4.0 million was transferred into foreclosed real estate and is comprised of real estate securing a former commercial loan located in Newport, Rhode Island. On February 20, 2018, the Bank entered into a Purchase & Sale Agreement to sell the foreclosed real estate for $4.4 million. The sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2016, two loans totaling $633,000, secured by commercial real estate that had been collateral for SBA loans were transferred into foreclosed real estate. 
         Other Loans of Concern.    There were no other loans at December 31, 2017 that are not already disclosed where there is information about possible credit problems of borrowers that caused management to have serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and that may result in disclosure of such loans in the future. 
  Classified Assets.    Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the FDIC to be of lesser quality, as "substandard," "doubtful" or "loss." An asset is considered "substandard" if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. "Substandard" assets include those characterized by the "distinct possibility" that the insured institution will sustain "some loss" if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as "doubtful" have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified "substandard," with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make "collection or liquidation in full," on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, "highly questionable and improbable." Assets classified as "loss" are those considered "uncollectible" and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as "special mention" by our management. 
         When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to 
 18

   particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as "loss," it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution's determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. 
         A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. 
         In accordance with our loan policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Loans are listed on the "watch list" initially because of emerging financial weaknesses even though the loan is currently performing as agreed, or delinquency status, or if the loan possesses weaknesses although currently performing. If a loan deteriorates in asset quality, the classification is changed to "special mention," "substandard," "doubtful" or "loss" depending on the circumstances and the evaluation. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status and classified "substandard." All other loans that are not considered to be classified assets or classified as special mention are considered to be classified as "pass". Management reviews the status of each impaired loan on our watch list on a quarterly basis. Management evaluates classified assets that are not impaired as a component of its general allowance to cover estimated probable losses. 
         On the basis of this review of our loans, we had classified or held as special mention the following loans as of the dates indicated:

        Classified and special mention loans at December 31, 2017 decreased $2.1 million from December 31, 2016. Special mention loans decreased $1.9 million from December 31, 2016. Five loans totaling $829,000 were upgraded to pass rated loans that were previously classified as "special mention", two loans totaling $115,000 were paid off, and two loans totaling $864,000 were downgraded to "substandard" during 2017. One loan totaling $76,000 was downgraded to "special mention" in 2017. "Substandard" loans decreased $162,000 from December 31, 2016 due to the transfer of one commercial real estate loan totaling $4.0 million to foreclosed real estate, and the payoff of two commercial real estate loans totaling $692,000, partially offset by the downgrade of three performing loans to one borrower totaling $3.1 million primarily due to operating losses; the downgrade of three loans totaling $761,000 to one borrower due to closure of the related business; the downgrade of $864,000 of loans from "special mention" to "substandard", and the downgrade of one other loan 
 19

   totaling $250,000. The commercial real estate loan totaling $4.0 million that was transferred to foreclosed real estate in September 2017, had been downgraded to "substandard" during the year ended December 31, 2016 based upon tax liens and a modification of the loan's maturity date. Two substandard commercial real estate loans totaling $1.0 million were upgraded from "substandard" based on improvement in credit quality during the year ended December 31, 2016. Two commercial real estate loans totaling $717,000 and two SBA loans totaling $487,000 were downgraded from "pass" to special mention during the year ended December 31, 2016. One SBA loan totaling $99,000 was downgraded to "doubtful" based on closure of the business, for which all the net carrying value is guaranteed by the SBA. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, special mention and substandard loans included $2.0 million and $2.5 million of SBA loans, of which $1.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively, was guaranteed by the SBA. 
   Allowance for Loan Losses 
         Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses.    Our allowance for loan losses is the amount considered necessary to reflect probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings. 
         Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of two key elements: (1) specific allowances for identified impaired loans; and (2) a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio. 
         We identify loans that may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all delinquent loans, classified loans, and other loans about which management may have concerns about collectability. For individually reviewed loans, the borrower's inability to make payments under the terms of the loan as well as the shortfall in collateral value could result in our charging off the loan or the portion of the loan that was impaired. 
         Among other factors, we consider current general economic conditions, including current housing price depreciation, in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses for our residential and home equity real estate portfolios. We use evidence obtained from our own loan portfolio, including loss history, as well as published housing data on our local markets from third party sources we believe to be reliable as a basis for assumptions about the impact of housing depreciation. For SBA loans and for commercial real estate loans, the underlying cash flows generated by the properties are adversely impacted by a downturn in the economy as evidenced by increased vacancy rates, which in turn, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. Non-real estate commercial loans are made to businesses and are generally secured by assets of the business. Repayment is expected from the cash flows of the business. Commercial construction generally represent loans to finance construction of retail and office space. A weakened economy, and resultant decreased consumer spending, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. Management monitors the cash flows of these loans. 
         Substantially all of our loans are secured by collateral. Loans 90 days past due and other classified loans are evaluated for impairment and specific allowances are established. Typically for a nonperforming impaired real estate loan, the value of the underlying collateral is estimated using an independent appraisal, adjusted for property specific conditions and other factors, and related specific reserves are adjusted on a quarterly basis. If a nonperforming impaired real estate loan is in the process of foreclosure and/or there are serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, and there is uncertainty about the value of the underlying collateral, we will order a new independent appraisal. Any shortfall would result in immediately charging off the portion of the loan that was impaired. 
 20

           Specific Allowances for Identified Problem Loans.    We evaluate the need for a specific allowance when loans are determined to be impaired. Specific reserves are measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling expenses or the fair value of the loan. Factors in identifying a specific problem loan include: (1) the strength of the customer's personal or business cash flows; (2) the availability of other sources of repayment; (3) the amount due or past due; (4) the type and value of collateral; (5) the strength of our collateral position; (6) the estimated cost to sell the collateral; and (7) the borrower's effort to cure the delinquency. In addition, for loans secured by real estate, we consider the extent of any past due and unpaid property taxes applicable to the property serving as collateral on the mortgage. 
  General Valuation Allowance on the Remainder of the Loan Portfolio.    We establish a general allowance for loans that are not classified as impaired to recognize the incurred losses inherent with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, has not been allocated to particular problem assets. This general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category (segments) and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience, and qualitative factors. These qualitative factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary market area, delinquency and credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. The applied loss factors are re-evaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current and overall economic environment and in relation to trends in the loan portfolio.

        At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.48% and 0.48% of total loans and 61.66% and 53.58% of non-performing loans. At December 31, 2015, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.47% of total loans and 51.75% of non-performing loans. At December 31, 2014, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.51% of total loans and 30.14% of non-performing loans. At December 31, 2013, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.50% of total loans and 25.64% of non-performing loans, and at December 31, 2012, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.53% of total loans and 20.48% of non-performing loans. There were $8,000, $176,000, $244,000, $146,000, and $480,000 in net loan charge-offs during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 
         Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate and management may determine that increases in the allowance are necessary if the quality of any portion of our loan portfolio deteriorates as a result. Furthermore, as an integral part of its examination process, the FDIC and/or the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation periodically review our allowance for loan losses. The FDIC and/or the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation may require that we increase our allowance based on its judgments of information available to it at the time of its examination. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
   Investment Activities 
  General.    Our board of directors is responsible for adopting our investment policy. The investment policy is reviewed annually by management and any changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to the approval of the board of directors. Our investment policy provides us with the ability to invest in short-term investments, which may include overnight federal funds, reverse repurchase agreements, banker's acceptances and/or U.S. government or federal agency securities, and longer-term investments, which we will consider investing in, including term federal funds, federal agency securities and certificates of deposit. Authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated to our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. All investment transactions are reviewed at regularly scheduled monthly meetings of the board of directors. 
         At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had no investment securities other than our required investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston stock. We may possibly invest in other investments permitted by our investment policy in the future. 
   Sources of Funds 
  General.    Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston advances, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on interest-earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. 
  Deposits.    Our deposits are generated primarily from residents within our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including non-interest-bearing demand accounts, money market 
 24

   accounts, savings accounts, club accounts and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. We have not in the past used, and currently do not hold, any brokered deposits. At December 31, 2017, we had $39.2 million in certificates of deposit at a weighted average interest rate of 1.62% obtained through a national on-line service ("national market"), representing 8.2% of total deposits. We utilized national market certificates of deposit in order to bolster on-balance sheet liquidity, to repay borrowed funds and to extend the duration of interest-bearing liabilities in anticipation of increasing interest rates. At December 31, 2017, our core deposits, which are deposits other than certificates of deposit, were $313.6 million, representing 65.8% of total deposits. 
         Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in generating deposits and to respond with flexibility to changes in our customers' demands. Our ability to gather deposits is impacted by the competitive market in which we operate, which includes numerous financial institutions of varying sizes offering a wide range of products. We believe that deposits are a stable source of funds, but our ability to attract and maintain deposits at favorable rates will be affected by market conditions, including competition and prevailing interest rates. 
         The following tables set forth the distribution of total deposit accounts, by account type, at or for the dates indicated.

 Borrowed Funds.    We may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston upon the security of our capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston and certain of our mortgage loans. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to re-pricing than our deposits, they can change our interest rate risk profile. At December 31, 2017, we had $181.7 million in outstanding advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. Borrowed funds at December 31, 2017 were comprised of $179.9 million in short-term advances at a weighted average rate of 1.49% and one long-term advance of $1.8 million which matures in September 2021 at no cost as the advance was made under the FHLB's Jobs for New England Program. At December 31, 2017, based on available collateral and our ownership of Federal Home Loan Bank of 
 26

   Boston stock, we had access to additional Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston advances of up to $60.8 million. 
         The following table sets forth information concerning balances and interest rates on our borrowings at the date and for the years indicated.

 Personnel 
         As of December 31, 2017, we had 148 employees, all of which were full-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management believes that we have a good working relationship with our employees. 
      SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
  General 
         Coastway Community Bank is a Rhode Island-chartered stock savings bank that became the wholly-owned subsidiary of Coastway Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation following completion of the mutual to stock conversion. Coastway Community Bank's deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. Coastway Community Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation, as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, its primary federal regulator and deposit insurer. Coastway Community Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. As a registered bank holding company, Coastway Bancorp, Inc. is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board. 
         The regulatory and supervisory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund, rather than for the protection of stockholders and creditors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies concerning the establishment of deposit insurance assessment fees, classification of assets and establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the Rhode Island legislature, the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation, the FDIC, the 
 27

   Federal Reserve Board or the United States Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of Coastway Bancorp, Inc. and Coastway Community Bank. As is further described below, the Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and may affect the lending, investment and general operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. 
         Set forth below is a summary of certain material statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to Coastway Bancorp, Inc. and Coastway Community Bank. The summary is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Coastway Bancorp, Inc. and Coastway Community Bank. 
   The Dodd-Frank Act 
         The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed bank regulation and has affected the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with extensive powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit "unfair, deceptive or abusive" acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as Coastway Community Bank, will continue to be examined by their applicable federal bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to issue regulations requiring lenders to make a reasonable good faith determination as to a prospective borrower's ability to repay a residential mortgage loan. The final "Ability to Repay" rules, which were effective beginning January 2014, established a "qualified mortgage" safe harbor for loans whose terms and features are deemed to make the loan less risky. In addition, on October 3, 2015, the new TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) rules for mortgage closings took effect for new loan applications. In 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau amended the TILA-RESPA rule with an effective date of October 1, 2018. 
         The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC assessments for deposit insurance, permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance to $250,000 per depositor. The legislation also, among other things, requires originators of certain securitized loans to retain a portion of the credit risk, stipulates regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees, repealed restrictions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage originations. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the ability of stockholders to influence boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called "golden parachute" payments. However, as an "emerging growth company" under the JOBS Act, we are exempt from the stockholder vote requirement until one year after we cease to be an "emerging growth company." The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. The Dodd-Frank Act also gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws. 
   Rhode Island Banking Laws and Supervision 
         General.    As a Rhode Island-chartered stock savings bank, Coastway Community Bank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation and to various Rhode Island statutes and regulations that govern, among other things, investment powers, lending and deposit-taking activities, borrowings, maintenance of surplus and reserve accounts, distribution of earnings and payment of dividends. In addition, a Rhode Island-chartered savings bank may exercise any power authorized for federal savings banks or national banks. The approval of the 
 28

   Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation is required for a Rhode Island-chartered bank to establish or relocate branches, merge with other financial institutions, issue stock and undertake certain other activities. 
  Loans to One Borrower Limitations.    Rhode Island banking law grants broad lending authority. However, with certain limited exceptions, total obligations to one borrower may not exceed 15 percent of the total of the bank's unimpaired capital as defined under Rhode Island law. 
  Investment Activities.    In general, Rhode Island-chartered savings banks may invest in any bonds, obligations or real or personal property as it may deem prudent, subject to any restrictions or limitations imposed by Rhode Island law. 
  Regulatory Enforcement Authority.    Any Rhode Island savings bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives of the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance, including revocation of its charter. The Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the bank's business in an unsafe or unsound manner or contrary to the depositors interests or been negligent in the performance of their duties. Upon finding that a bank has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the bank concerned. The Director also has authority to take possession of a bank and appoint a liquidating agent under certain conditions such as an unsafe and unsound condition to transact business, the conduct of business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner of impaired capital. 
   Federal Regulations 
  Capital Requirements.    Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8%, and a 4% Tier l capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
         In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a "capital conservation buffer" consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. At December 31, 2017, the minimum capital standards inclusive of the capital conservation buffer are: total capital of 8.625%, Tier I capital of 6.625% and common equity Tier I of 5.125%. For 2018, the capital conservation buffer is 1.875% of risk-weighted assets. 
         For purposes of the regulatory capital requirements, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders' equity and retained earnings. Tier l capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions such as Coastway Community Bank, 
 29

   that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("AOCI"), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
         In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 
         In assessing an institution's capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. 
         At December 31, 2017, Coastway Community Bank was classified as well-capitalized. 
  Standards for Safety and Soundness.    As required by statute, the federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit system, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits and, more recently, safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. 
  Business and Investment Activities.    Under federal law, all state-chartered FDIC-insured banks, including savings banks, have been limited in their activities as principal and in their equity investments to the type and the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law. Federal law permits exceptions to these limitations. For example, certain state-chartered savings banks may, with FDIC approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange and in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The maximum permissible investment is the lesser of 100.0% of Tier 1 capital or the maximum amount permitted by Rhode Island law. 
         The FDIC is also authorized to permit state banks to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 specified that a state bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a "financial subsidiary," if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes. 
  Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action.    Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take "prompt corrective action" with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 
 30



        The applicable FDIC regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. Under the amended regulations, an institution is deemed to be "well capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is "adequately capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is "undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be "significantly undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be "critically undercapitalized" if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. 
         "Undercapitalized" banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend) and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. A bank's compliance with such a plan must be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the institution's total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an "undercapitalized" bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is "significantly undercapitalized." "Significantly undercapitalized" banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional measures, including, but not limited to, a required sale of sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, a requirement to reduce total assets, cessation of taking deposits from correspondent banks, the dismissal of directors or officers and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. "Critically undercapitalized" institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status. 
  Transactions with Related Parties.    Transactions between a bank (and, generally, its subsidiaries) and its related parties or affiliates are limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in "covered transactions" with any one affiliate to 10% of such institution's capital stock and surplus and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such institution's capital stock and surplus. The term "covered transaction" includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar transactions. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with specified requirements. The law also requires that affiliate transactions be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution, as those provided to non-affiliates. 
         Coastway Community Bank's authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders:
 

 be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those
prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated 

 31

   

persons
and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and 


 not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in
part, on the amount of Coastway Community Bank's capital. 

         In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Coastway Community Bank's board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved. 
         Enforcement.    The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured state savings banks, including Coastway Community Bank. That enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. The FDIC also has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under certain circumstances. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was "critically undercapitalized" on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became "critically undercapitalized." 
  Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts.    The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. 
         The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC and the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-term fund ratio of 2%. 
         Under the FDIC's risk-based assessment system, insured institutions were assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. Rates are based on each institution's risk category and certain specified risk adjustments. Stronger institutions pay lower rates while riskier institutions pay higher rates. Assessments were based on an institution's average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, with the assessment rate schedule ranging from 2.5 to 45 basis points. 
         Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated the risk categories. Assessments for most institutions are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating th probability of failure within three years. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio achieving 1.5% the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for most banks and savings associations to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points. 
         In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation ("FICO") is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO began to mature in 2017 and will continue to mature through 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the annualized Financing Corporation assessment was equal to 0.54 of a basis point of total average assets less average tangible capital. 
         The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Coastway Community Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. 
 32

           Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
         Community Reinvestment Act.    Under the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA"), a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to establish or acquire branches and merger with other depository institutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institution's CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. Coastway Community Bank's latest FDIC CRA rating, dated 2017, was "outstanding." 
  Federal Reserve System.    The Federal Reserve Board regulations require savings institutions to maintain non-interest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) and regular checking accounts). The regulations generally provide that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows as of January 1, 2018: a 3% reserve ratio is assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $115.1 million; a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $115.1 million. The first $15.5 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements. The amounts are adjusted annually. Coastway Community Bank complies with the foregoing requirements. 
  Federal Home Loan Bank System.    Coastway Community Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of twelve regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, Coastway Community Bank is required to acquire and hold a specified amount of shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. As of December 31, 2017, Coastway Community Bank was in compliance with this requirement. 
   Other Regulations 
         Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Coastway Community Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Coastway Community Bank's operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:


 Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 
 Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for one- to four-family residential real estate receive
various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement services; 
 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine
whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 

 33

   

 Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 
 Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; 
 Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 
 Truth in Savings Act governing disclosures of terms and conditions regarding interest and fees when giving out information on or opening a new
savings account; and 
 Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. 

         The operations of Coastway Community Bank also are subject to the:
 

 Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for
complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 
 Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit
accounts and customers' rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; 
 Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as "Check 21"), which gives "substitute checks," such as digital check
images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; 
 USA PATRIOT Act, which requires savings banks operating to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs,
due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also
applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; and 
 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated
third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial
institution's privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to "opt out" of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties. 

 Holding Company Regulation 
         Coastway Bancorp, Inc., as a bank holding company is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. Coastway Bancorp, Inc. is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval would be required for Coastway Bancorp, Inc. to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. 
         A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board 
 34

   to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing securities brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property under certain conditions; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings association. 
         The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorizes a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including depository institutions subsidiaries that are "well capitalized" and "well managed," to opt to become a "financial holding company." A "financial holding company" may engage in a broader array of financial activities than permitted a typical bank holding company. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. Coastway Bancorp, Inc. has elected "financial holding company" status. 
         In December 2014, legislation was passed by Congress that required the Federal Reserve to revise its "Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement" to exempt bank and savings and loan holding companies of less than $1.0 billion of consolidated assets from the consolidated capital requirements, provided that such companies meet certain other conditions such as not engaging in significant nonbanking activities. The Federal Reserve maintains authority to apply the consolidated capital requirements to any bank of savings and loan holding company as warranted for supervisory purposes. On April 9, 2015, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued the Final Rule to implement Public Law 113-250 enacted on December 18, 2014 that updates the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement ("Policy Statement"), which became effective in May 2015. Pursuant to the Policy Statement, capital rules and reporting requirements will not apply to the small bank holding companies (defined as less than $1.0 billion in assets) which meet the following criteria: (1) not engaged in significant non-bank activities; (2) no significant off-balance sheet activities conducted through a non-bank subsidiary, and (3) no material amount of SEC registered debt or equity securities outstanding (other than trust preferred). The Bank will still be subject to the capital rules and reporting requirements, though the Company will be exempt. 
         A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company's consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted an exception to that approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. 
         The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board's policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board's policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by using available resources to provide capital funds during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy and requires the promulgation of implementing regulations. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These 
 35

   regulatory policies could affect the ability of Coastway Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
         The Federal Deposit Insurance Act makes depository institutions liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the insurance fund in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default. That law would have potential applicability if Coastway Bancorp, Inc. ever held as a separate subsidiary a depository institution in addition to Coastway Community Bank. 
         Coastway Bancorp, Inc. and Coastway Community Bank will be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of various agencies of the United States Government, including the Federal Reserve System. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, it is impossible for management to accurately predict future changes in monetary policy or the effect of such changes on the business or financial condition of Coastway Bancorp, Inc. or Coastway Community Bank. 
         Coastway Bancorp, Inc.'s status as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act will not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws. 
  Rhode Island Holding Company Regulation.    Coastway Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the regulation and supervision of the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation. It is subject to periodic examination by the department. 
   Federal Securities Laws 
         Our common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We are subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
         The registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of shares of the Company's common stock issued in the stock offering does not cover the resale of those shares. Shares of common stock purchased by persons who are not our affiliates may be resold without registration. Shares purchased by our affiliates are subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If we meet the current public information requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, each affiliate of ours that complies with the other conditions of Rule 144, including those that require the affiliate's sale to be aggregated with those of other persons, would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of 1% of our outstanding shares, or the average weekly volume of trading in the shares during the preceding four calendar weeks. In the future, we may permit affiliates to have their shares registered for sale under the Securities Act of 1933. 
   Emerging Growth Company Status 
         On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an "emerging growth company." We qualify as an "emerging growth company" and believe that we will continue to qualify as an "emerging growth company" for five years from the completion of the stock offering, or January 14, 2019, or until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion, (b) the date that we become a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (c) the 
 36

   date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. 
         As an "emerging growth company," we have elected to use the transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. As of December 31, 2017, there is not a significant difference in the presentation of our financial statements as compared to other public companies as a result of this transition guidance. 
         Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act as an "emerging growth company", we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Act, (iii) hold non-binding stockholder votes regarding annual executive compensation or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger or similar corporate transaction, (iv) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (v) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer's compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an "emerging growth company," whichever is earlier. 
   Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
         The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. We prepared policies, procedures and systems designed to ensure compliance with these regulations. 
   Federal Taxation 
  General.    Coastway Bancorp, Inc. and Coastway Community Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Coastway Bancorp, Inc. and Coastway Community Bank. 
  Method of Accounting.    For federal income tax purposes, Coastway Community Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31st for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns. 
 37

    Minimum Tax.    The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, referred to as "alternative minimum taxable income." The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount. Net operating losses can, in general, offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax ("AMT") may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. At December 31, 2017, Coastway Community Bank had no alternative minimum tax credit carryforward. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 31, 2017, AMT will no longer be imposed, commencing in 2018. 
  Corporate Dividends.    We may exclude from our income 100% of dividends received from Coastway Community Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. 
         Audit of Tax Returns.    Our federal and state tax returns are not currently under audit, and our federal and state tax returns have not been audited during the past five years. We are no longer subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities for years prior to the year ended December 31, 2014. 
   State Taxation 
         Coastway Bancorp, Inc., and Coastway Community Bank are subject to Rhode Island's corporate income tax, which is imposed at a flat rate of 9% on apportioned "adjusted gross income." "Adjusted gross income," for purposes of the Rhode Island corporate income tax, begins with taxable income as defined by Section 44-11 of the Rhode Island Code, and thus, incorporates federal tax law to the extent that it affects the computation of taxable income. Federal taxable income is then adjusted by several modifications pursuant to Rhode Island tax regulation. 
         As a Maryland business corporation, Coastway Bancorp, Inc. is required to file an annual report with and pay franchise taxes to the state of Maryland. Coastway Bancorp, Inc. is also subject to an income based tax in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
