ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Item 1.  Description of Business
History
 
Grow Condos, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on October 22, 1999 as Calibrus, in the State of Nevada. From its inception, the Company was a call center that contracted out as a customer contact center for a variety of business clients throughout the United States. Over time our main business became a third-party verification service.  After making a sale on the telephone, a company would send the call to a Company operator to confirm the order.  This process protected both the customer and the company selling services from telephone sales fraud.
 
While continuing to operate as a call center, in 2008 we expanded our business plan to include the development of a social networking site called JabberMonkey (Jabbermonkey.com) and the development of a location based social networking application for smart phones called Fanatic Fans.
 
On June 22, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to our articles of incorporation to increase our authorized capital to 180,000,000 shares, consisting of 175,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock (the “Recapitalization”) and to change the name of the Company to Grow Capital Inc. The Company filed articles of amendment with the State of Nevada to effect the aforementioned changes on July 10, 2018 and August 28, 2018 respectively. The Company has submitted application to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") for approval of the above noted corporate actions. 
 WCS Enterprises
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, WCS Enterprises, LLC ("WCS Enterprises") is an Oregon limited liability company which was formed on September 9, 2013 and was acquired by us in June 2014 in exchange for shares of our

common stock.  The acquisition of WCS Enterprises resulted in a change of control of the Company and at or shortly after the closing of such acquisition, the persons designated by WCS Enterprises became the officers and directors of the Company.  As a result of our acquisition of WCS Enterprises in June 2014, we became engaged in the business of being a real estate purchaser, developer and manager of specific use industrial properties business.
 
WCS Enterprises Business Operations
 
Through WCS Enterprises, we are a real estate purchaser, developer and manager of specific use industrial properties providing "Condo" style turn-key grow facilities to support cannabis growers in the United States cannabis industry. We intend to own, lease, sell and manage multi-tenant properties so as to reduce the risk of ownership and reduce costs to the tenants and owners. We offer tenants the option to lease, lease to purchase or buy their condo warehouse space that is divided into comparable 1,500- 2,500 square foot condominium units.  Each Condo unit will be uniquely designed and have all necessary resources as an optimum stand-alone grow facility. We believe that Cannabis farmers will pay an above market rate to lease or buy our condo grow facility. We will purchase and develop buildings that are divisible into separate units to attract multiple farmers and reduce the risk of single tenant leases. In addition to our "Condo" turn-key growing facilities we intend to provide marijuana grow consulting services and equipment and supplies as part of our turn-key offerings. We are aggressively out looking for our next property in the western area of the United States where medical cannabis has been legalized and where recreational cannabis has been or is in the process of legalization. On April 1, 2016 we closed escrow on our second project located in the Pioneer Business Park in Eugene, Oregon.  The Company is not directly involved in the growing, distribution or sale of cannabis.
 
Smoke on the Water, Inc. 
 
Smoke on the Water, Inc., was incorporated on October 21, 2016, in the State of Nevada and is a wholly owned subsidiary.
 
Smoke on the Water Business Operations
 
Smoke on the Water is designed to capitalize on the country's growing level of recreational marijuana acceptance. The company plans to engage in a roll up strategy for this highly-fragmented industry and provide turn-key solutions for Marijuana-friendly campgrounds and resorts. The company has strategized to initially develop the property through acquisition, subsequently rebranding the existing RV business to represent the Smoke on The Water brand. Upon project launch, the Company plans to provide fully functional vacationing solutions to campground operators and owners seeking to fill the growing demand for stress free and acceptable vacationing for the pro-personal choice and marijuana smoking community.
On March 7, 2017, Smoke on the Water, Inc. executed a Real Estate Purchase Agreement to acquire the Lake Selmac Resort located at 2700 Lakeshore Drive, Selma, Oregon. 
 
Owned Properties
 
We have secured real estate in Eagle Point in Jackson County, Oregon representing our sole condominium operating location.  The building is 15,000 square feet and zoned to meet the requirements for specific purpose industrial use and is divided into four 1,500 square feet condo style grow rooms which, is being leased to four tenants and one 7,500 square feet grow facility leased to one tenant, a related party.
 
Further we have acquired real estate located just 20 miles from Grants Pass, Oregon and 2.5 miles east of the Redwood Highway in Selma, Oregon known as the Lake Selmac Resort. The total property occupies approximately 5.85 acres, has 29 RV spaces (13 pull through spots), 2 cabins and a convenience store, boat dock, bath house and coin operated laundry facilities. The Resort facilities also include fishing, swimming, boating, and tent camping. This is our first cannabis friendly tourist destination. We also operate a full-service country store.
 
In September 2018, the Company completed the sale of its land held in the Pioneer Business Park near Eugene, OR. The Company received proceeds of approximately $74,000 after payment of expenses of the sale and full retirement of the attached mortgage of approximately $250,000.

Sales & Leasing
 
We develop, lease, own and provide investment sales opportunities for commercial industrial properties focused in the cannabis production arena.  The company has relationships with tenants, brokers and investors across the cannabis industry to leverage successful transactions for both lease-to-own option as well as investors looking to purchase facilities with qualified tenants providing positive cash-flow backed by commercial property.
 
Tourist Recreation and site rentals 
 
During fiscal 2017 we acquired our first cannabis friendly tourist destination with the purchase of Lake Selmac Resort where we offer facilities including fishing, swimming, boating, RV parking, tent camping & cabin accommodation. This property has had increased operations in our most recently completed fiscal year. 
 
Supplies and Equipment
 
We intend in the future, to provide operators state-of-the art equipment and methodology to provide efficient implementation to assist clients to realize stabilized operations faster.
 
Financing
 
We intend in the future, to assist tenants with financing for space build-out as well as acquisition of commercial property.
 
Marketing
 
Our initial marketing will be aimed at attracting customers through networking with real estate agencies, agents, commercial brokers and consulting groups that are involved in the cannabis industry.  We will target specific trade shows, conferences and seminars associated with cannabis growers.  As our capital for marketing is very limited we are reviewing the cost of advertising on the radio or in print or running ads on certain cannabis industry online websites. Further during 2017 we commenced marketing of our Smoke on the Water brand. With our Lake Selmac resort property we provide fully functional vacationing solutions to campground operators and owners seeking to fill the growing demand for stress free and acceptable vacationing for the pro-personal choice and marijuana smoking community.
Employees
 
We currently have four employees two of whom are officers of the Company and one of whom is employed part time. Our employees are not represented by unions and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Facilities
 
Our office is located at 722 W. Dutton Rd, Eagle Point, Oregon 97524 and is in the building that we own.  We currently pay no rent.  We believe this facility will be adequate for our needs for the next twelve months.
Competition
 
Commercial real estate:
 
The commercial real estate market is highly competitive.  We believe finding properties that are zoned for the specific use of allowing cannabis growers may be limited as more competitors enter the market.  Initially we will aggressively target states in the western US that legally allow for medical and recreational cannabis to be grown.  We have identified several competitors that appear to have offerings similar to ours.  They are Zoned Properties, Inc. (ZDPY), MJ Holdings, Inc. (MJNE), and Home Treasure Finders, Inc. (HMTF)

Zoned Properties, Inc. - Zoned Properties, Inc., a real estate investment firm, focuses on acquiring free standing buildings, land parcels, and greenhouses in order to have them re-zoned to be able to carry out aeroponics agricultural grow operations. It plans to operate primarily in Arizona, Illinois, Nevada, and Colorado.  
 
MJ Holdings, Inc. – MJ Holdings, Inc. acquires and leases real estate to licensed marijuana operators, including but not limited to providing complete turnkey growing space and related facilities to licensed marijuana growers and dispensary owners.  Additionally, MJ Holdings plans to explore ancillary opportunities in the regulated marijuana industry.
 
Home Treasure Finders, Inc. – Home Treasure Finders, Inc. is engaged in a real estate lead referral business in Colorado. It focuses on buying and selling properties; and leasing its real estate properties to cannabis growers for cannabis cultivation. The company also manages 55 rental units. Home Treasure Finders, Inc. was founded in 2008 and is based in Denver, Colorado.  Advanced Cannabis Solutions, Inc. – Advanced Cannabis Solutions, Inc. a development stage company, focuses on providing real estate leasing services to the regulated cannabis industry in the United States. It plans to purchase real estate assets; and lease growing space and related facilities to licensed marijuana growers and dispensary owners for their operations. The company was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
 
Cannabis friendly resort properties:
 
There are currently 29 states in the U.S. that have legalized medical marijuana and 8 states in the U.S. that permit adult cannabis usage and have adopted laws which govern and permit recreational usage of cannabis on private property and by adults over the age of 21. Oregon, Washington and Colorado are three such states. 
 
The market for cannabis friendly resort properties in those states with recreational cannabis usage laws is small but growing. Presently we have identified only a handful of locations which we believe are competitive to our business model. Management believes there is substantial room for expansion in this particular field of operation with roll up of privately held resort and campground locations in this burgeoning leisure property space:
 
(1)Wilderness Bud and Breakfast San Juan National Forest, Pagosa Springs, CO 
 This property offers a wide variety of wilderness 420 friendly camping experiences featuring 420 Happy Hour, served daily and featuring a selection of the finest organic flowers, cannabis-infused edibles and extracts from the sunny southwest of Colorado. Tipis and tent sites are located on the banks of the Rio Blanco. Camp kitchen, stoves, BBQ, outhouse, solar shower and campfire area are located on the campgrounds. 
(2)CanyonSide Campground, Fort Collins, CO 
 Family owned and operated campground located in the Poudre Canyon, along the Cache La Poudre River. Property has five furnished cabins, ten RV sites with hook-ups and large tenting area. Property is located between Fort Collins and Walden, Colorado. 
 
Further there are various locations in Washington and Colorado which have been identified by The Travel Joint http://thetraveljoint.com/cannabis-camping/ as being friendly to edibles as opposed to smoking cannabis, which have not been included in our competitive analysis. 
 
Government Regulation
 
Currently, there are approximately twenty states plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulations that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. Fifteen other states are considering legislation to similar effect. As of the date of this writing, the policy and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal use is prohibited on the basis of federal law and may or may not be permitted on the basis of state law.

The Department of Justice governs the use of cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Schedule 21 of the U.S. Code includes five established schedules of controlled substances known as schedules I, II, III, IV, and V. The Department of Justice has mandated that schedules established by this section shall be updated and republished on a semi-annual basis during the two-year period beginning one year after October 27, 1970 and shall be updated and republished on an annual basis thereafter. Schedule I includes cannabis in its listing. Substances included in Schedule I have the following characteristics:
 
(A) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse;
 (B) The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States;
 (C) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.
 On January 4, 2018 the office of the Attorney General published a memo regarding Marijuana Enforcement that rescinds Obama-era directives easing federal enforcement. While marijuana has always been illegal under federal law, as noted above, certain states have legalized adult usage under various local laws which govern substance usage and limits. In the January 8, 2018 memo, Jefferson B. Sessions, Attorney General has indicated enforcement decisions will be left up to the U.S. Attorney’s in the respective States clearly indicating that the burden is with “federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute by weighing all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of federal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.”
 The Company does not believe this directive will have a substantive impact on its planned operations. 
 
On April 13, 2018 it was announced that President Donald Trump had promised Senate Republican Cory Gardner that he will support congressional efforts to protect states that have legalized marijuana, defusing a months-long standoff between Sen. Cory Gardner and the administration over Justice Department nominees. Trump told Gardner that despite the DOJ memo of January 4, 2018, the marijuana industry in Colorado will not be targeted. A bill has not been finalized, but discussion has commenced to find legislation that would, in effect, make clear the federal government cannot interfere with states that have voted to legalize marijuana.(1)

We do not produce, market, or sell cannabis.  We are limiting ourselves to states where the state law allows for the production of cannabis. Beyond the state law allowing for cannabis production our construction must comply with all state and local building requirements as well as zoning requirements.  We work closely with the local authorities regarding zoning and work closely with the local building inspectors to comply in every way with building regulations.
