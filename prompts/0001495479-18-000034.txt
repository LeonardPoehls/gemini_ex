Item 1. Business.
Our Business
We are an owner and operator of two distinct Italian restaurant brands, BRAVO! Cucina Italiana (“BRAVO!”) and BRIO Tuscan Grille (“BRIO”). We have positioned our brands as multifaceted culinary destinations that deliver the ambiance, design elements and food quality reminiscent of fine dining restaurants at a value typically offered by casual dining establishments, a combination known as the upscale affordable dining segment. Each of our brands provides its guests with a fine dining experience and value by serving affordable cuisine prepared using fresh, flavorful ingredients and authentic Italian cooking methods, combined with attentive service in an attractive, lively atmosphere. We strive to be the best Italian restaurant company in America and are focused on providing our guests an excellent dining experience through consistency of execution.
Bravo Brio Restaurant Group, Inc. was incorporated in July 1987 as an Ohio corporation under the name Belden Village Venture, Inc. Our name was changed to Bravo Cucina of Dayton, Inc. in September 1995, to Bravo Development, Inc. in December 1998 and to Bravo Brio Restaurant Group, Inc. in June 2010. The first BRAVO! restaurant opened in 1992 and the first BRIO restaurant opened in 1999, each in Columbus, Ohio. We completed the initial public offering of our common shares in October 2010. As of December 31, 2017, we operated 113 restaurants in 32 states. Additionally, one BRIO restaurant is operated under a franchise agreement. Bravo Brio Restaurant Group’s mission statement is to be the best Italian restaurant company in America by delivering the highest quality food and service to each guest...at each meal...each and every day.
BRAVO! Cucina Italiana
BRAVO! Cucina Italiana is a full-service, upscale affordable Italian restaurant offering a broad menu of freshly-prepared classic Italian food served in a lively, high-energy environment with attentive service. The subtitle “Cucina Italiana,” meaning “Italian Kitchen,” is appropriate since all cooking is done in full view of our guests, creating the energy of live theater. BRAVO! offers a wide variety of pasta dishes, steaks, chicken, seafood and pizzas, emphasizing fresh, made-to-order cuisine and authentic recipes that deliver an excellent value to guests. BRAVO! also offers creative seasonal specials, an extensive wine list, carry-out and catering.
The average check for BRAVO! during fiscal 2017 was $21.57 per guest with an average lunch check of $17.10 per guest and an average dinner check of $24.39 per guest. At BRAVO! in 2017, lunch and dinner represented 30% and 70% of revenues, respectively, and alcohol sales accounted for approximately 18% of restaurant sales. Our average annual revenues per comparable BRAVO! restaurant were $2.9 million in fiscal 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we owned and operated 49 BRAVO! restaurants in 23 states.
BRIO Tuscan Grille
BRIO Tuscan Grille is an upscale affordable Italian chophouse restaurant serving freshly-prepared, authentic northern Italian food in a Tuscan villa atmosphere. BRIO means “lively” or “full of life” in Italian and draws its inspiration from the cherished Tuscan philosophy of “to eat well is to live well.” The cuisine at BRIO is prepared using fresh ingredients and a high standard for quality execution with an emphasis on steaks, chops, fresh seafood and made-to-order pastas. BRIO also offers creative seasonal specials, an extensive wine list, carry-out and banquet facilities at select locations.
The average check for BRIO during fiscal 2017 was $26.83 per guest, with an average lunch check of $20.21 per guest and an average dinner check of $31.54 per guest. At BRIO in 2017, lunch and dinner represented 31% and 69% of revenues, respectively, and alcohol sales accounted for approximately 22% of restaurant sales. Our average annual revenues per comparable BRIO restaurant were $4.0 million in fiscal 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we operated 64 BRIO restaurants in 21 states, all of which we own with the exception of one restaurant that we operate under a management agreement pursuant to which we receive a management fee. Additionally, one BRIO restaurant is operated under a franchise agreement.
We operate one full-service upscale affordable American-French bistro restaurant in Columbus, Ohio under the brand “Bon Vie.” Our Bon Vie restaurant is included in the BRIO operating and financial data set forth in this annual report.
Real Estate
As of December 31, 2017, we leased 109 operating locations and owned three locations, of which 100 are located adjacent to or in lifestyle centers and/or shopping malls and 12 are free-standing units strategically positioned in high-traffic 
5

areas. On average, our restaurants range in size from 6,000 to 9,000 square feet. The majority of our leases provide for minimum annual rentals and contain percentage-of-sales rent provisions against which the minimum rent is applied. A significant percentage of our leases also provide for periodic escalation of minimum annual rent. Typically, our leases are ten or 15 years in length with two, five-year extension options. See Part I, Item 2 “Properties.”
Landlords and developers seek out our concepts to be restaurant anchors for their developments as they are complementary to national retailers, having attracted on average between approximately 2,700-4,500 guests per restaurant each week in fiscal 2017. As a result of the importance of our brands to the retail centers in which we are located, we are often able to negotiate a prime location within a center as well as favorable real estate terms and choose between our two brands to determine which is optimal for a location. This helps to generate attractive returns on our investment and drive positive returns on capital for our shareholders. On average, a restaurant opening requires a net cash investment of approximately $1.5 to $2.5 million.
Site Selection Process
Part of our growth strategy is to develop a nationwide system of restaurants. We have developed a disciplined site acquisition and qualification process incorporating management’s experience as well as extensive data collection, analysis and interpretation. We are actively developing BRAVO! and BRIO restaurants in both new and existing markets, and we will continue to expand in major metropolitan areas throughout the United States. Management closely analyzes traffic patterns, demographic characteristics, population density, level of affluence and consumer attitudes or preferences. In addition, management carefully evaluates the current or expected co-retail and restaurant tenants in order to accurately assess the attractiveness of the identified area.
BRAVO! and BRIO are highly sought after by the owners and developers of upscale shopping centers and mixed use projects. We are therefore typically made aware of new developments and opportunities very early on in their selection process. In addition to our real estate personnel and broker network actively seeking locations, we do site screening on projects that are brought to our attention in the planning phases.
Design
BRAVO! and BRIO restaurants integrate critical design elements of each brand while making each restaurant unique. Consideration is taken with each design to incorporate the center’s architecture and other regional design elements while still maintaining certain critical features that help identify our brands. Our interiors, while timeless and inviting, incorporate current trends that give our restaurants a sophisticated yet classic feel. This flexibility of design allows us to build one and two story restaurants and to place restaurants in a variety of locales, including ground up locations, in-line locations and conversions of office, retail and restaurant space.
Our brands maintain several common qualities, including certain design elements such as chandeliers and marble and granite counter tops that help reduce building and construction costs and create consistency for our guests. We share best practices in service, preparation and food quality across both brands. In addition, we share services such as real estate development, purchasing, human resources, marketing and advertising, information technology, finance and accounting, allowing us to maximize efficiencies across our company.
The flexibility of our concepts has enabled us to open restaurants in a wide variety of locations, including high-density residential areas, shopping malls, lifestyle centers and other high-traffic locations. On average, it takes us approximately 12 to 18 months from identification of the specific site to opening the doors for business. In order to maintain consistency of food, guest service and atmosphere at our restaurants, we have set processes and timelines to follow for all restaurant openings to ensure they stay on schedule.
The identification of new sites along with their development and construction are the responsibilities of the Company’s Real Estate Development Group. Our project managers are responsible for building the restaurants, and our staff members deal with purchasing, project management, budgeting, scheduling and other administrative functions. Senior management reviews the comprehensive studies provided by the Real Estate Development Group to determine which regions to pursue prior to any new restaurant development.
In fiscal 2015, we executed our first franchise agreement with an experienced restaurant owner and operator in San Juan, Puerto Rico, pursuant to which our franchise partner will pay us a royalty fee to use our BRIO brand name, menu, and design elements. Currently, we have no plans to further franchise any of our brands. However, we intend to evaluate all similar opportunities in the future and may expand upon this initial franchise location if we deem it to be in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders.

Restaurant Operations
We have a group of district partners who report to a regional Vice President or the Chief Operating Officer. The regional Vice President reports to our Chief Operating Officer, who in turn reports to our President and Chief Executive Officer. Each restaurant district partner typically supervises the operations of six to nine restaurants in his or her respective geographic area and is in frequent contact with each location. We additionally have two Corporate Executive Chefs, one for each brand. The staffing at our restaurants typically consists of a general manager, two to three assistant managers, an executive chef and one to three sous chefs. In addition, our restaurants typically employ 60 to 150 hourly employees. Our operational philosophy is as follows:

• | Offer Italian Food and Wines. We seek to differentiate ourselves from other multi-location restaurants by offering affordable cuisine prepared using fresh ingredients and authentic Italian cooking methods. To ensure that the menu is consistently prepared to our high standards, we have developed a comprehensive eight week management training program. As part of their skill preparation, all of our executive chefs perform a cooking demonstration. This enables our Corporate Executive Chefs to evaluate a candidate’s skill set. All executive chefs are required to complete eight weeks of kitchen training, including mastering all stations, ordering, receiving and inventory control. Due to our high average unit volumes, the executive chefs are trained throughout the eight weeks to ensure that their food is consistently prepared on a timely basis. In addition, all executive chefs are trained on product and labor management programs to achieve maximum efficiencies. Both of these tools reinforce our commitment to training our employees to run their business from a profit and loss perspective, as well as from the culinary side. We offer made-to-order menu items prepared using traditional Italian culinary techniques with an emphasis on fresh ingredients and authentic recipes. Our food menu is complemented by a wine list that offers both familiar varieties as well as wines exclusive to our restaurants. An attention to detail, culinary expertise and focused execution reflects our chef-driven culture. Each brand’s menu has its own distinctive flavor profile, with BRAVO! favoring the more classic Italian cuisine that includes a variety of pasta dishes and pizzas and BRIO favoring a broader selection of premium steaks, chops, seafood, flatbreads, bruschettas and pastas. All of our new menu items are developed by our Corporate Executive Chefs through a six month ideation process designed to meet our high standards of quality and exceed our guests’ expectations. 


• | Deliver Superior Guest Service. We are committed to delivering superior service to each guest, at each meal, each and every day. Significant time and resources are spent in the development and implementation of our training programs, resulting in a comprehensive service system for both hourly service people and management. We offer guests prompt, friendly and efficient service, keeping wait staff-to-table ratios high, and staffing each restaurant with experienced “on the floor” management teams to ensure consistent and attentive guest service. We employ server assistants to ensure prompt delivery of fresh dishes at the appropriate temperature, thus allowing the wait staff to focus on overall guest satisfaction. All service personnel are trained in the specific flavors of each dish. Using an understanding of our menu, the servers assist guests in selecting menu items complementing individual preferences. Only trained, experienced chefs and culinary staff are hired and allowed to operate in the kitchen. Best-in-class service standards are designed to ensure satisfied guests and attract both new and repeat guest traffic. 


• | Leverage Our Partnership Management Philosophy. A key element to our expansion and success has been the development of our partnership management philosophy, which is based on the premise that active and ongoing economic participation (via a bonus plan) by each restaurant’s general manager, executive chef, assistant managers and sous chefs is essential to long-term success. The purpose of this structure is to attract and retain an experienced management team, incentivize the team to execute our strategy and objectives and provide stability to the operating management team. This program is offered to all restaurant management personnel. This provides our management team with the financial incentive to develop people, build lifelong guests and operate their restaurants in accordance with our standards. 

Sourcing and Supply
To ensure the highest quality menu ingredients, raw materials and other supplies, we continually research and evaluate products. We contract with Distribution Market Advantage ("DMA"), a cooperative of multiple food distributors located throughout the nation, for the broadline distribution of most of our food products. DMA is a company with whom we negotiate and gain access to third party food distributors and suppliers. The DMA distributors supplied us with approximately 70% of our food supplies. We utilize distributors Gordon Food Service (“GFS”), Ben E. Keith Company (“BEK”), Shamrock Foods (“Shamrock”) and Nicholas & Company (“Nicholas”) under the DMA arrangement. At the end of fiscal 2017, GFS, BEK, Shamrock, and Nicholas distributed approximately 81%, 8%, 6% and 5%, respectively, of the food supplies distributed through our DMA arrangement. We negotiate pricing and volume terms either directly with certain of our suppliers and distributors or through DMA. Currently, we have pricing agreements of varying lengths with several of our distributors and suppliers, including our distributors and suppliers of poultry, certain seafood products, dairy products, soups and sauces, bakery 
7

items and certain meat products. Our restaurants place orders directly with the distributors and maintain regular distribution schedules.
Our purchasing contracts cover substantially all of our requirements for a specific product. Our contracts typically provide either for fixed or variable pricing based on an agreed upon cost-plus formula and require that our suppliers deliver directly to our distributors. In addition to our broadline distribution arrangements, we utilize direct distribution for several products, including a portion of our meat, a majority of our fresh seafood, produce and alcoholic beverages. We also contract with a third party provider to supply, maintain and remove our cooking shortening and oil systems.
We have a procurement strategy for all of our product categories that includes contingency plans for key products, ingredients and supplies. These plans include selecting suppliers that maintain alternate production facilities capable of satisfying our requirements, or in certain instances, the approval of secondary suppliers or alternative products. We believe our procurement strategy will allow us to obtain sufficient product quantities from other sources at competitive prices.
Food Safety
Providing a safe and clean dining experience for our guests is essential to our mission statement. We have taken steps to mitigate food quality and safety risks, including designing and implementing a training program for our chefs, hourly service employees and managers focusing on food safety and quality assurance. In addition, we include food safety standards and procedures in every recipe for our cooks. We also consider food safety and quality assurance when selecting our distributors and suppliers. Our suppliers are inspected by federal, state and local regulators or other reputable, qualified inspection services, which helps ensure their compliance with all applicable food safety and quality guidelines.
Marketing and Advertising
The target audience for BRAVO! and BRIO is primarily college-educated professionals, ages 35-65, and their families who dine out frequently for social or special occasions. Our marketing strategy is designed to create brand awareness, reinforce our made-to-order, chef-inspired menu and develop ongoing relationships with these guests to increase dining frequency and drive comparable restaurant sales growth.
Local Restaurant Marketing
We seek to connect with the consumers and businesses in our local community to create awareness, trial, and loyalty. Each local restaurant management team engages guests and potential guests both inside and outside of the restaurant to create a loyal following for our brands.
Advertising
Our goal is to create relevant and compelling programs designed to attract new guests while also increasing core guest frequency. For each key marketing promotion, we create a fully integrated campaign which typically consists of in-store merchandising, e-mail messaging, social media, public relations, paid search and digital display advertising, and local store marketing support.
A portion of our marketing budget is spent on point-of-sale materials which effectively communicate key brand initiatives to guests while they are dining in our restaurants. These programs include add-on sales and value initiatives, seasonal menu changes, holiday promotions, limited time offers, bar promotions, private party and banquet offerings. We also spend a portion of our marketing budget on targeted digital media, which allows us to generate awareness and trial in a geo-targeted area around our restaurants most efficiently.
New Restaurant Openings
We use the openings of new restaurants as opportunities to reach out to various media outlets as well as the local community. Local public relations firms are retained to assist BRAVO! and BRIO with obtaining appearances on radio and television cooking shows, establishing relationships with local charities and gaining coverage in local newspapers and magazines. We employ a variety of marketing techniques to promote new openings along with press releases, direct mail, e-marketing, blogger outreach and other local restaurant marketing activities, which include concierge parties, training lunches and dinners with local residents, media, community leaders and businesses. In addition, we typically partner with local charities and host events during the first month of our grand openings.

E-Marketing & Social Media
One of our goals is to give guests every opportunity to engage with us, so we’ve made it a priority to make ourselves accessible to them through various digital channels including our website, email, and social networks. We are active on a variety of communications channels, including social media (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) and our MyBravo Mail and MyBrio Mail E-Clubs.  Each channel serves a unique purpose and allows us to reach a significant number of people in a timely and targeted fashion at a fraction of the cost of traditional media. We will continue to allocate a portion of our marketing budget toward this rapidly growing area.
Rewards Program
In 2015, both brands began offering an incentive in order to boost core guest frequency. For every five (5) visits, members earn a reward to redeem on their next visit. The reward programs, called “MyBRAVO Rewards” and “MyBRIO Rewards", were designed to reward guests for their continuous dining at our restaurants. Guests can download a MyBRAVO/MyBRIO! Rewards mobile application, register their cards at BRAVO! and BRIO locations or online at www.myBRAVOReward.com or www.myBRIOReward.com. Guests who join receive exclusive offers loaded onto their account, special event information and other announcements via e-mail throughout the year. The program also serves as a high impact communication tool to inform members of the exciting new marketing programs for each brand.
Training and Employee Programs
We conduct comprehensive training programs for our management, hourly employees and corporate personnel. Our training department provides a series of formulated training modules that are used throughout our company, including leadership training, team building, food safety certification, alcohol safety programs, guest service philosophy training, sexual harassment training and others. E-learning is utilized for several management training modules in our eight week management training program, which culminates in three days of classroom certification and testing.
We utilize a specific training process for new restaurant openings, which is overseen by regional trainers who conduct both service and kitchen training and are on site through the first two weeks of opening. The regional trainers lend support and introduce our standards and culture to the new team. We believe that hiring the best available team members and committing to their training helps keep retention high during the restaurant opening process.
We have a training and employee development program called Bravo Brio Restaurant Group University (BBRGU). The “Rising Star” program, which was created under the umbrella of BBRGU to develop aspiring hourly team members into assistant managers and chefs, has been an instrumental part of our training and retention program. The key element of the Rising Star program is to provide upward mobility within the organization, utilizing existing labor hours in the restaurants for focused training of the most promising employees. Many of our General Managers and Executive Chefs have gained their positions through internal promotions as a result of this program. 
Additionally, we have designed our Assistant General Manager and Executive Sous Chef programs to identify and develop our future General Managers and Executive Chefs from within our current employee base. This program not only reduces the cost of searching and training for these positions, it also provides a specific career path which we can market and promote within our current management teams. 
Management Information Systems
Restaurant level financial and accounting controls are handled through a point-of-sale (“POS”) cash register system and computer network in each restaurant that communicates with our corporate headquarters. The POS system is also used to authorize and transmit credit card sales transactions. Our restaurant communications are comprised of cable, DSL, Fractional T1 and T1 lines. Our restaurants use back-office applications to manage the business and control both food and labor costs. The food control software helps drive food and beverage costs down by identifying kitchen or bar inefficiencies and, through the menu engineering capabilities, it aides in enhancing profitability. The labor control software provides the ability to schedule labor and manage labor costs, including time clock governance that does not allow an employee to “clock in” more than a designated amount of time before a scheduled shift.
We utilize an enterprise reporting package ("ERP") system which includes general ledger, accounts payable, fixed asset accounting, payroll and human resources subsystems. The data pulled from the restaurants is integrated into the ERP system and a data warehouse. This data provides visibility that allows us to better analyze the business. 
We continue to leverage our internal website called PASTAnet, which provides us with the ability to collaborate, communicate, train and share information between the restaurants and our corporate office.

Both BRAVO! and BRIO have mobile applications in both the Apple and Google app stores. These mobile applications allow our guests to view our menus, find a location and get directions. We also have Online Ordering for both BRAVO! and BRIO restaurants. Guests can order online for both BRAVO! and BRIO via our mobile applications or websites. We also continue to support the wireless access points in all of our restaurants to provide our guests wireless internet services. 
Government Regulation
We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws affecting our business. Each of our restaurants is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of government authorities, which may include alcoholic beverage control, nutritional information disclosure, product safety, health, sanitation, environmental, zoning and public safety agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties in obtaining or failures to obtain required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development and openings of new restaurants or could disrupt the operations of existing restaurants. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations and, to date, we have not experienced abnormal difficulties or delays in obtaining the licenses or approvals required to open or operate any of our restaurants.
During fiscal 2017, approximately 20% of our restaurant sales were attributable to alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities, for licenses and permits to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be subject to penalties, temporary suspension or revocation for cause at any time. The failure of a restaurant to obtain its licenses, permits or other approvals, or any suspension of such licenses, permits or other approvals, would adversely affect that restaurant’s operations and profitability and could adversely affect our ability to obtain these licenses, permits and approvals elsewhere. Alcoholic beverage control regulations impact many aspects of the daily operations of our restaurants, including: the minimum ages of patrons and staff members consuming or serving these beverages, respectively; staff member alcoholic beverage training and certification requirements; hours of operation; advertising; wholesale purchasing and inventory control of these beverages; the seating of minors and the serving of food within our bar areas; special menus and events, such as happy hours; and the storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. State and local authorities in many jurisdictions routinely monitor compliance with alcoholic beverage laws.
We are also subject to “dram shop” statutes in most of the states in which we operate, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party. We train our staff on how to serve alcohol, and we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance. We have never been named as a defendant in a lawsuit involving a “dram shop” statute.
Various federal and state labor laws govern our operations and our relationships with our staff members, including such matters as minimum wages, meal and rest breaks, overtime, tip credits, fringe benefits, family leave, safety, working conditions, unionization, citizenship or work authorization requirements and hiring and employment practices. We are also subject to increasingly complex federal and state immigration laws and regulations, including regulations of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In addition, some states in which we operate have adopted immigration employment laws which impose additional conditions on employers. Even if we operate our restaurants in strict compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of these federal and state agencies, some of our staff members may not meet federal citizenship or residency requirements or may lack appropriate work authorizations, which could lead to a disruption in our work force. We are also subject to federal and state child labor laws which, among other things, prohibit the use of certain “hazardous equipment” by staff members younger than 18 years old.
Significant government-imposed increases in minimum wages, paid or unpaid leaves of absence, sick leave and mandated health benefits, or increased tax reporting, assessment or payment requirements related to our staff members who receive gratuities, could be detrimental to the profitability of our restaurants. Minimum wage increases in recent years at the federal level and in the states in which we operate have impacted the profitability of our restaurants and led to increased menu prices. In addition, the costs of insurance and medical care have risen significantly over the past few years and are expected to continue to increase. The national health care reform legislation enacted on March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”), has increased our health care benefit costs. The requirement that we provide health insurance benefits to staff members or the additional employer paid employment taxes on income earned by our employees, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us. While we carry employment practices insurance covering a variety of labor-related liability claims, a settlement or judgment against us that is uninsured or in excess of our coverage limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial position.
10

We are subject to a variety of federal and state environmental regulations, including various laws concerning the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, such as cleaning solvents, and the operation of restaurants in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations. We do not anticipate that compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or which otherwise relate to the protection of the environment, will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, revenues or competitive position.
Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”) and related federal and state statutes. The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to public accommodations and employment. Under the ADA and related federal and state laws, we must make access to our new or significantly remodeled restaurants readily accessible to disabled persons. We must also make reasonable accommodations for the employment of disabled persons.
We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments, gift cards and consumer credit, protection and fraud, and any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our financial condition.
We have a significant number of hourly restaurant staff members who receive income from gratuities. We have elected to voluntarily participate in a Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment (“TRAC”) agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). By complying with the educational and other requirements of the TRAC agreement, we reduce the likelihood of potential employer-only FICA tax assessments for unreported or underreported tips. However, we rely on our staff members to accurately disclose the full amount of their tip income and our reporting on the disclosures provided to us by such tipped employees.
See Item 1A “Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state and local regulation of our business.
Intellectual Property
We currently own ten separate registrations in connection with restaurant service from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the following trademarks: Bravo Brio Restaurant Group®, BRAVO!®, BRAVO! Cucina Italiana®, Cucina BRAVO! Italiana®, BRAVO! Italian Kitchen®, Brio®, Brio Tuscan Grille™, Bon Vie®, Brio Coastal Bar & Kitchen® and Brio Bar Del Mar®. Our registrations confer a federally recognized exclusive right for us to use these trademarks throughout the United States, and we can prevent the adoption of confusingly similar trademarks by other restaurants that do not possess superior common law rights in particular markets. An important part of our intellectual property strategy is the monitoring and enforcement of our rights in markets in which our restaurants currently exist or markets which we intend to enter in the future. We also monitor trademark registers to oppose the registration of confusingly similar trademarks or to limit the expansion of existing trademarks with superior common law rights.
We enforce our rights through a number of methods, including the issuance of cease-and-desist letters or making infringement claims in federal court. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance.
Seasonality
Our business is sensitive to seasonal fluctuations as, historically, the percentage of operating income earned during the first and fourth quarters has been higher than the other quarters due in part to higher restaurant sales during the winter months in our stores located in the southern region of the United States and the year-end holiday season.
Competition
The restaurant business is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and location, and is affected by many factors, including changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns, macroeconomic conditions, demographic trends, weather conditions, the cost and availability of raw materials, labor and energy and government regulations. Any change in these or other related factors could adversely affect our restaurant operations. The main competitors for our brands are other operators of mid-priced, full service concepts in the multi-location, upscale affordable dining segment in which we compete most directly for real estate locations and guests, including Maggiano’s, Cheesecake Factory, P.F. Chang’s and BJ’s Restaurants. We also compete to a lesser extent with nationally recognized casual dining Italian restaurants such as Romano’s Macaroni Grill, Carrabba’s Italian Grill and Olive Garden, as well as high quality, locally-owned and operated Italian restaurants.
11

There are a number of well-established competitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours. In addition, many of our competitors are well established in the markets where our operations are, or in which they may be, located. While we believe that our restaurants are distinctive in design and operating concept, other companies may develop restaurants that operate with similar concepts. In addition, with improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants, quick-service restaurants and grocery stores, consumers may choose to trade down to these alternatives, which could also negatively affect our financial results.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 9,500 employees of whom approximately 100 were corporate management and staff personnel, approximately 600 were restaurant managers or trainees, and approximately 8,800 were employees in non-management restaurant positions. None of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
