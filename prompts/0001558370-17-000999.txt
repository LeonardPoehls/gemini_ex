 ITEM 1.      Business
 General
 Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a holding company, incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1981, that conducts business through its subsidiaries. Founded in 1937, we are one of the oldest mutual fund complexes in the United States, having introduced the Waddell & Reed Advisors group of mutual funds (the “Advisors Funds”) in 1940. Over time we added additional mutual funds: Ivy Funds (the “Ivy Funds”); Ivy Variable Insurance Portfolios, our variable product offering (“Ivy VIP”); InvestEd Portfolios, our 529 college savings plan (“InvestEd”); Ivy High Income Opportunities Fund, a closed-end mutual fund (“IVH”); and the Ivy Global Investors Fund Société d’Investissement à Capital Variable (the “SICAV”) and its Ivy Global Investors sub‑funds (the “IGI Funds”), an undertaking for the collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS”). In 2016, we introduced the Ivy NextShares® exchange-traded managed funds (“Ivy NextShares”) (collectively, the Advisors Funds, Ivy Funds, Ivy VIP, InvestEd, IVH and Ivy NextShares are referred to as the “Funds”). As of December 31, 2016, we had $80.5 billion in assets under management.
 We derive our revenues from providing investment management, investment advisory, investment product underwriting and distribution, and shareholder services administration to the Funds, the IGI Funds, and institutional and separately managed accounts. Investment management fees are based on the amount of average assets under management and are affected by sales levels, financial market conditions, redemptions and the composition of assets. Our underwriting and distribution revenues consist of fees earned on fee‑based asset allocation products and related advisory services, asset‑based service and distribution fees promulgated under the 1940 Act (“Rule 12b-1”), commissions derived from sales of investment and insurance products, and distribution fees on certain variable products. The products sold have various commission structures and the revenues received from those sales vary based on the type and dollar amount sold. Shareholder service fee revenue includes transfer agency fees, custodian fees from retirement plan accounts, and portfolio accounting and administration fees, and is earned based on assets under management or number of client accounts.
 We operate our business through a balanced distribution network. Our retail products are distributed through third parties such as other broker-dealers, registered investment advisers and various retirement platforms (collectively, the “retail unaffiliated distribution channel”) or through associated independent contractor financial advisors (the “retail broker-dealer channel”). We also market our investment advisory services to institutional investors, either directly or through consultants (the “institutional channel”).

 Our retail unaffiliated distribution channel efforts include retail fund distribution through broker-dealers (the primary method of distributing mutual funds for the industry), registered investment advisers (fee‑based financial advisors who generally sell mutual funds through financial supermarkets) and retirement and insurance platforms. Assets under management in this channel were $30.3 billion at the end of 2016.
 In the retail broker-dealer channel, associated independent financial advisors focus their efforts primarily on financial planning, serving mostly middle class and mass affluent clients. We compete with smaller broker-dealers and independent financial advisors, as well as a span of other financial service providers. Assets under management in this channel were $42.3 billion at December 31, 2016.
 Through our institutional channel, we serve as subadviser for domestic and foreign distributors of investment products for pension funds, Taft‑Hartley plans and endowments. Additionally, we serve as investment adviser and distributor of the IGI Funds. Assets under management in the institutional channel were $7.9 billion at December 31, 2016.
 Organization
 We operate our investment advisory business through our subsidiary companies, primarily Waddell & Reed Investment Management Company (“WRIMCO”), a registered investment adviser for the Advisors Funds and Ivy Investment Management Company (“IICO”), the registered investment adviser for the Ivy Funds, Ivy VIP, InvestEd, the IGI Funds, and Ivy NextShares and global distributor of the IGI Funds.   
 Our underwriting and distribution business operates through two broker-dealers: Waddell & Reed, Inc. (“W&R”) and Ivy Distributors, Inc. (“IDI”). W&R is a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser that acts primarily as the national distributor and underwriter for shares of the Advisors Funds, InvestEd and other mutual funds, and as a distributor of variable annuities and other insurance products issued by our business partners. In addition, W&R is the largest distributor of the Ivy Funds. IDI is the distributor and underwriter for the Ivy Funds, Ivy VIP and Ivy Nextshares.
 Waddell & Reed Services Company (“WRSCO”) provides transfer agency and accounting services to the Funds. Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc., W&R, WRIMCO, WRSCO, IICO and IDI are hereafter collectively referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” unless the context requires otherwise.
 Investment Management Operations
 Our investment advisory business provides one of our largest sources of revenues. We earn investment management fee revenues by providing investment advisory and management services pursuant to investment management agreements with the Funds. While the specific terms of the agreements vary, the basic terms are similar. The agreements provide that we render overall investment management services to each of the Funds, subject to the oversight of each Fund’s board of trustees and in accordance with each Fund’s investment objectives and policies. The agreements permit us to enter into separate agreements for shareholder services or accounting services with each respective Fund.
 Each Fund’s board of trustees, including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons” of the Fund or the Company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “ICA”) (“disinterested members”) and the Fund’s shareholders must approve the investment management agreement between the respective Fund and the Company. These agreements may continue in effect from year to year if specifically approved at least annually by (i) the Fund’s board, including a majority of the disinterested members, or (ii) the vote of a majority of both the shareholders of the Fund and the disinterested members of each Fund’s board, each vote being cast in person at a meeting called for such purpose. Each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined by the ICA or the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and may be terminated without penalty by any Fund by giving us 60 days’ written notice if the termination has been approved by a majority of the Fund’s trustees or the Fund’s shareholders. We may terminate an investment management agreement without penalty on 120 days’ written notice.
 In addition to performing investment management services for the Funds, we act as an investment adviser for the IGI Funds, institutional and other private investors and we provide subadvisory services to other investment companies. Such services are provided pursuant to various written agreements and our fees are generally based on a percentage of assets under management.

 Our investment management team begins each business day in a collaborative discussion that fosters idea sharing, yet reinforces individual accountability. Through all market cycles, we remain dedicated to the following investment principles:

· | Rigorous fundamental research—an enduring investment culture that dedicates itself to analyzing companies on our own rather than relying exclusively on widely available research produced by others.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Collaboration and accountability—a balance of collaboration and individual accountability, which ensures the sharing and analysis of investment ideas among investment professionals while empowering portfolio managers to shape their portfolios individually.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focus on growing and protecting investors’ assets—a sound approach that seeks to capture asset appreciation when market conditions are favorable and strives to manage risk during difficult market periods.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  These three principles shape our investment philosophy and money management approach. For nearly 80 years, our investment organization has delivered consistently competitive investment performance. Through bull and bear markets, our investment professionals have not strayed from what works—fundamental research and a time‑tested investment process. We believe investors turn to us because they appreciate that our investment approach continues to identify and create opportunities for wealth creation.
 Our investment management team is comprised of 78 professionals, including 34 portfolio managers who average 23 years of industry experience and 15 years of tenure with our firm. We have significant experience in virtually all major asset classes, several specialized asset classes and a range of investment styles. At December 31, 2016, 76% of the Company’s $80.5 billion in assets under management were invested in equities, of which 79% was domestic and 21% was international. In recent years, we have supported growth of international investments by adding investment professionals native to countries that we consider emerging markets. They, along with other members of the investment team, focus on understanding foreign markets and capturing investment opportunities. Our investment management team also includes subadvisors who bring similar investment philosophies and additional expertise in specific asset classes.
 Investment Management Products
 Our mutual fund families offer a wide variety of investment options. We are the exclusive underwriter and distributor of 90 registered open‑end mutual fund portfolios in the Funds, which includes 14 investment styles. Additionally, we have one closed‑end offering, three Ivy NextShares exchange-traded managed funds and offer the IGI Funds through our institutional channel. The Advisors Funds, variable products offering Ivy VIP, and InvestEd are offered primarily through W&R financial advisors in the retail broker-dealer channel; in some circumstances, certain of those funds are also offered through the retail unaffiliated distribution channel. The Ivy Funds are offered through both our retail unaffiliated distribution channel and retail broker-dealer channel. The Funds’ assets under management are included in either our retail unaffiliated distribution channel or our retail broker-dealer channel depending on which channel marketed the client account or is the broker of record.
 During 2016, we launched the Ivy Targeted Return Bond fund, subadvised by Pictet Asset Management, and the Ivy California Municipal High Income fund. The Ivy Targeted Return Bond fund seeks to provide a positive total return over the long‑term across all market environments by investing in any form of debt security issued in the U.S or internationally. The Ivy California Municipal High Income fund seeks a high level of income that is exempt from federal and California income taxes.  In January of 2017, we launched the Ivy IG International Small Cap fund, subadvised by IG International Management Ltd. This fund seeks smaller-capitalization companies outside North America that exhibit perceived growth at a reasonable price.
 Additionally in 2016, we introduced three Ivy NextShares as part of a planned lineup of NextShares exchange-traded managed funds.  Ivy Energy NextShares invests primarily in securities of companies within all aspects of the energy sector.  Ivy Focused Growth NextShares invests primarily in a portfolio of common stock issued by large capitalization, growth-oriented companies that the portfolio manager believes have the ability to sustain growth over the long-term.  Ivy Focused Value NextShares invests primarily in the common stocks of companies that the portfolio manager believes are undervalued, trading at a significant discount relative to the intrinsic value of the Company as estimated by IICO and/or are out of favor in financial markets but have a favorable outlook for capital appreciation.

 Other Products
 We offer our retail broker-dealer channel clients a variety of fee‑based asset allocation products, including Managed Allocation Portfolio (“MAP”), MAP Plus, MAP Choice, MAP Flex, MAP Select, MAP Latitude and Strategic Portfolio Allocation (“SPA”). These products utilize a variety of investment options including mutual funds, as well as individual stock, bond and exchange traded fund investment options. As of December 31, 2016, clients had $18.4 billion invested in our fee‑based asset allocation products, of which $15.6 billion is invested in our mutual funds and included in our mutual fund assets under management.
 In our retail broker-dealer channel, we distribute various business partners’ variable annuity products, which offer Ivy VIP as an investment vehicle. We also offer our retail broker-dealer channel customers retirement and life insurance products underwritten by our business partners. Through our insurance agency subsidiary, W&R financial advisors also sell life insurance and disability products underwritten by various carriers.
 Distribution Channels
 We distribute our investment products through the retail unaffiliated distribution, retail broker-dealer and institutional channels.
 Retail Unaffiliated Distribution Channel
 Our team of 42 external wholesalers lead our wholesaling efforts, which focus principally on distributing the Ivy Funds through three segments: broker-dealers (the largest method of distributing mutual funds for the industry and for us), retirement platforms (401(k) platforms using multiple managers) and registered investment advisers (fee‑based financial advisors who generally sell mutual funds through financial supermarkets). Additionally, our National Accounts team, comprised of 10 employees, work with our distribution partners managing current and new relationships. Retail Broker-Dealer Channel
 Throughout our history, independent W&R advisors have sold investment products primarily to middle income and mass affluent individuals, families and businesses across the country in geographic markets of all sizes. We assist clients on a wide range of financial issues with a significant focus on helping them plan, generally, for long‑term investments such as retirement and education, and offer one‑on‑one consultations that emphasize long‑term relationships through continued service. As a result of this approach, this channel has developed a loyal customer base with clients maintaining their accounts significantly longer than the industry average. Over the past several years, we have expanded our brokerage platform technology and offerings, and continue to do so which enable us to competitively recruit experienced advisors.
 As of December 31, 2016, there were 1,780 independent W&R financial advisors who operate out of offices located throughout the United States. We believe, based on industry data, that W&R financial advisors are currently one of the largest groups in the United States selling primarily mutual funds, and that W&R, our broker-dealer subsidiary, ranks among the largest independent broker-dealers. Retail broker-dealer channel underwriting and distribution fee revenues per the average number of advisors were $243 thousand, $265 thousand and $254 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, our retail broker-dealer channel had approximately 426,000 mutual fund customers.
 Institutional Channel
 Through this channel, we manage assets in a variety of investment styles for a variety of institutions. The largest client type is other asset managers that hire us to act as subadviser; they are typically domestic and foreign distributors of investment products who lack scale or the track record to manage internally, or choose to market multi‑manager styles. Over time, the institutional channel has been successful in developing subadvisory relationships, and as of December 31, 2016, subadvisory business comprised more than 60% of the institutional channel’s assets. Our diverse client list also includes the IGI Funds, pension funds, Taft‑Hartley plans and endowments.

 Service Agreements
 We earn service fee revenues by providing various services to the Funds and their shareholders. Pursuant to shareholder servicing agreements, we perform shareholder servicing functions for which the Funds pay us a monthly fee, including: maintaining shareholder accounts; issuing, transferring and redeeming shares; distributing dividends and paying redemptions; furnishing information related to the Funds; and handling shareholder inquiries. Pursuant to accounting service agreements, we provide the Funds with bookkeeping and accounting services and assistance for which the Funds pay us a monthly fee, including: maintaining the Funds’ records; pricing Fund shares; and preparing prospectuses for existing shareholders, proxy statements and certain other shareholder reports.
 Agreements with the Funds may be adopted or amended with the approval of the disinterested members of each Fund’s board of trustees and have annually renewable terms of one year.
 Competition
 The financial services industry is a highly competitive global industry. According to the Investment Company Institute (the “ICI”), at the end of 2016 there were more than 9,500 open‑end investment companies, more than 500 closed‑end investment companies and more than 1,700 exchange traded funds of varying sizes, investment policies and objectives whose shares are being offered to the public in the United States alone. Factors affecting our business include brand recognition, business reputation, investment performance, quality of service and the continuity of both client relationships and assets under management. A majority of mutual fund sales go to funds that are highly rated by a small number of well‑known ranking services that focus on investment performance. Competition is based on distribution methods, the type and quality of shareholder services, the success of marketing efforts, the ability to develop investment products for certain market segments to meet the changing needs of investors, and the achievement of competitive investment management performance.
 We compete with hundreds of other mutual fund management, distribution and service companies that distribute their fund shares through a variety of methods, including affiliated and unaffiliated sales forces, broker-dealers and direct sales to the public of shares offered at a low or no sales charge. Many larger mutual fund complexes have significant advertising budgets and established relationships with brokerage houses with large distribution networks, which enable these fund complexes to reach broad client bases. Many investment management firms offer services and products similar to ours, as well as other independent financial advisors. We also compete with brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, commercial banks and other financial institutions and businesses offering other financial products in all aspects of their businesses. Although no single company or group of companies consistently dominates the mutual fund management and services industry, many are larger than us, have greater resources and offer a wider array of financial services and products. 
 The distribution of mutual funds and other investment products has undergone significant developments in recent years, which has intensified the competitive environment in which we operate. These developments include the introduction of new products, increasingly complex distribution systems with multiple classes of shares, the development of internet websites providing investors with the ability to invest on‑line, the introduction of sophisticated technological platforms used by financial advisors to sell and service mutual funds for their clients, the introduction of separately managed accounts—previously available only to institutional investors—to individuals, and growth in the number of mutual funds offered.  In recent years, we have faced significant competition from passive oriented investment strategies, which have taken market share from active managers like ourselves.  While we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain, we believe there will always be demand for active management.
 We believe we effectively compete across multiple dimensions of the asset management and broker-dealer businesses. First, we market our products, primarily the Ivy Funds family, to unaffiliated broker-dealers and advisors and compete against other asset managers offering mutual fund products. This distribution method allows us to move beyond proprietary distribution and increases our potential pool of clients. Competition is based on sales techniques, personal relationships and skills, and the quality of financial planning products and services offered. We compete against asset managers that are both larger and smaller than our firm, but we believe that the breadth and depth of our products position us to compete in this environment. In this marketplace, we compete with a broad range of asset managers. Second, W&R financial advisors, who operate through our affiliated broker-dealer, have access to our proprietary financial products. We believe our business model targets customers seeking personal assistance from financial advisors or planners where the primary competition is companies distributing products through financial advisors. The market for financial advice is 

 
  7

 
extremely broad and fragmented. W&R financial advisors compete primarily with large and small broker-dealers, independent financial advisors, registered investment advisers, financial institutions and insurance representatives. Finally, we compete in the institutional marketplace, working with consultants who select asset managers for various opportunities, as well as working directly with plan sponsors, foundations, endowments, sovereign funds and other asset managers who hire subadvisors. 
 We also face competition in attracting and retaining qualified financial advisors and employees. To maximize our ability to compete effectively in our business, we offer competitive compensation.
 For additional discussion regarding the impact of competition, please see the Market and Competition risk factors included in Item 1A—“Risk Factors” in this annual report.
 Regulation
 The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation and virtually all aspects of our business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients and shareholders of registered investment companies. Under such laws and regulations, agencies and organizations that regulate investment advisers, broker-dealers, and transfer agents like us have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit an investment adviser, broker-dealer or transfer agent from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In such event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include, but are not limited to, the suspension of individual employees or agents, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, censures, fines and the revocation of investment adviser and other registrations.
 The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) is the federal agency responsible for the administration of federal securities laws. Certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Advisers Act, which imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers including, among other things, fiduciary duties, record‑keeping and reporting requirements, operational requirements and disclosure obligations, as well as general anti‑fraud prohibitions. Investment advisers are subject to periodic examination by the SEC, and the SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration.
 Our Funds are registered as investment companies with the SEC under the ICA, and various filings are made with states under applicable state rules and regulations. The ICA regulates the relationship between a mutual fund and its investment adviser and prohibits or severely restricts principal transactions and joint transactions. Various regulations cover certain investment strategies that may be used by the Funds for hedging and/or speculative purposes. To the extent the Funds purchase futures contracts, options on futures contracts, swaps and foreign currency contracts, they are subject to the commodities and futures regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
 We derive a large portion of our revenues from investment management agreements. Under the Advisers Act, our investment management agreements terminate automatically if assigned without the client’s consent. Under the ICA, investment advisory agreements with registered investment companies, such as the Funds, terminate automatically upon assignment. The term “assignment” is broadly defined and includes direct assignments, as well as assignments that may be deemed to occur, under certain circumstances, upon the transfer, directly or indirectly, of a controlling interest in the Company.
 The Company is also subject to federal and state laws affecting corporate governance, including the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules adopted by the SEC. Our report on internal controls over financial reporting for 2016 is included in Part I, Item 9A.
 As a publicly traded company, we are also subject to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”), the exchange on which our stock is listed, including the corporate governance listing standards approved by the SEC.
 Two of our subsidiaries, W&R and IDI, are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and the states. Much of the broker-dealer regulation has been delegated by the SEC to self‑regulatory organizations, principally the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), which is the primary regulator of our broker-dealer activities. These self‑regulatory organizations adopt rules (subject to approval by the SEC) 

 
  8

 
that govern the industry and conduct periodic examinations of our operations over which they have jurisdiction. Securities firms are also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales practices, market making and trading among broker-dealers, the use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital structure, record‑keeping, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Violation of applicable regulations can result in the revocation of broker-dealer licenses, the imposition of censures or fines, and the suspension or expulsion of a firm, its officers or employees.
 W&R and IDI are each subject to certain net capital requirements pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3‑1 of the Exchange Act (the “Net Capital Rule”) specifies the minimum level of net capital a registered broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that part of its assets be kept in a relatively liquid form. The Net Capital Rule is designed to ensure the financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. Any failure to maintain the required minimum net capital may subject us to suspension or revocation of our registration or other limitations on our activity by the SEC, and suspension or expulsion by FINRA or other regulatory bodies, and ultimately could require the broker-dealer’s liquidation. The maintenance of minimum net capital requirements may also limit our ability to pay dividends. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, net capital for W&R and IDI exceeded all minimum requirements.
 Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, W&R is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (the “SIPC”). IDI is exempt from the membership requirements and is not a member of the SIPC. The SIPC provides protection against lost, stolen or missing securities (but not loss in value due to a rise or fall in market prices) for clients in the event of the failure of a broker-dealer. Accounts are protected up to $500,000 per client with a limit of $100,000 for cash balances. However, since the Funds, and not our broker-dealer subsidiaries, maintain customer accounts, SIPC protection would not cover mutual fund shareholders whose accounts are maintained directly with the Funds, but would apply to brokerage accounts held on our brokerage platform.
 Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti‑Terrorist Financing Act of 2001, imposes significant anti‑money laundering requirements on all financial institutions, including domestic banks and domestic operations of foreign banks, broker-dealers, futures commission merchants and investment companies.
 The Company and the independent financial advisors in our retail broker-dealer channel are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to the extent they are considered “fiduciaries” under ERISA with respect to certain clients.  The U.S. Department of Labor, which administers ERISA, adopted regulations in April 2016 that, among other things, treat as fiduciaries any person who provides investment advice or recommendations to employee benefit plans, plan fiduciaries, plan participants, plan beneficiaries, IRAs or IRA owners. 
 Our operations outside the United States are subject to the laws and regulations of various non‑U.S. jurisdictions and non‑U.S. regulatory agencies and bodies, including the regulation of the IGI Funds by Luxembourg’s Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier as UCITS. Similar to the United States, non‑U.S. regulatory agencies have broad authority in the event of non‑compliance with laws and regulations.
 Our businesses may be materially affected not only by regulations applicable to us as an investment adviser, broker-dealer or transfer agent, but also by law and regulations of general application. For example, the volume of our principal investment advisory business in a given time period could be affected by, among other things, existing and proposed tax legislation and other governmental regulations and policies (including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board), and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules that affect the business and financial communities.
 Our business is also subject to new and changing laws and regulations. For additional discussion regarding the impact of current and proposed legal or regulatory requirements, please see the Legal, Regulatory and Tax risk factors included in Item 1A—“Risk Factors” in this annual report.
 Intellectual Property
 We regard our names as material to our business, and have registered certain service marks associated with our business with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
