Overview and History
 
Trailblazer Resources, Inc., formerly Energy Composites Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) currently is a holding company with no ongoing business operations.   We were incorporated on October 29, 1992 under the laws of the State of Nevada.  Prior to October 14, 2008, we were defined as a “shell” company whose sole purpose was to locate and consummate a merger or acquisition with a private entity.  As of October 14, 2008, we completed a reverse acquisition of Advanced Fiberglass Technologies, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (“AFT”).  Pursuant to the reverse acquisition, we issued 28,750,000 shares of our common stock to AFT’s shareholders (approximately 72% of the then issued and outstanding common stock) and AFT’s shareholders gained voting control of our Company.  As a result of the reverse acquisition, we were no longer considered a “shell” company and AFT became our wholly-owned subsidiary.  On August 23, 2010, AFT changed its name to ECC Corrosion, Inc. (“ECC-C”).
 
ECC-C was incorporated in the state of Wisconsin on January 1, 2005, following nearly ten years operating as M&W Fiberglass, LLC (“M&W”).  Founded in 1995 by Jamie and Jennifer Mancl, M&W was the operating entity that developed and operated ECC-C’s business.  In January 2005, M&W transferred all operating assets and liabilities into a newly formed S-Corporation: ECC-C.  
 
On December 15, 2008, we closed a private offering of units consisting of (i) a 3-year, 6% convertible debenture (the “Debentures”) with a conversion price of $2.50 per share, and (ii) a number of warrants (the “Warrants”) exercisable into shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the principal amount of the Debentures.  Each Warrant was originally exercisable into shares of common stock for a term of 3 years at $5.00 per share.  We issued Debentures with a face amount of $6,370,000 and Warrants exercisable into 2,548,000 shares of common stock.  As of December 31, 2016, Debentures in the total principal amount of $5,970,000 have been converted into common stock of the Company, including $150,000 in December 2016, however, the majority of which occurred prior to 2013.  The number of shares of common stock issued as principal and interest for these conversions has totaled 2,474,926 shares through December 31, 2016 and 82,998 were in common stock payable as of December 31, 2016 and subsequently issued in January 2017.
 
On March 8, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the temporary reduction of the exercise price of outstanding Warrants to $2.50 per share from $5.00 per share. The temporary exercise price reduction was valid from March 22, 2010 through May 6, 2010.  After May 6, 2010, the warrants reverted back to their original terms. During 2010, the Company received $590,823 related to the exercise of 236,329 warrants to purchase its common stock at $2.50 per share from warrant holders. 
 
On September 2, 2011 the Board of Directors of the Company, acting on the recommendation of its disinterested directors, approved the sale of all of the stock of ECC-C to Jamie and Jennifer Mancl and their affiliated entities who were the majority shareholders of the Company (the “Mancls”) in exchange for substantially all of the Mancls’ shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement dated August 12, 2011 (the “ECC-C Sale”).  This decision was made due to the continuing operating losses that had been incurred since the reverse acquisition of AFT on October 14, 2008.  As additional funding was going to be required, it was determined to be in the best interests of the Company to dispose of this operating subsidiary.  On October 21, 2011, the Company completed the ECC-C Sale and the Company cancelled 24,039,180 shares of the Company that had been owned by the Mancls. After the ECC-C Sale, we were once again a shell company. We changed the name of the Company to Trailblazer Resources, Inc. effective October 17, 2011.
 
On December 15, 2011, the Board of Directors extended the expiration date of the remaining 2,311,671 Warrants that had been issued in connection with the convertible Debentures in 2008 to December 31, 2012 and reduced the exercise price to $1.50 per share.  Since December 31, 2012, the expiration date has been extended several times and the exercise price was further reduced. The Warrants expired on June 30, 2014.

Our Plan of Operations
 
Since the disposition of ECC-C in 2011, our plan of operations has been to identify and evaluate industries and business opportunities in order to find a suitable acquisition target for the Company.
 
On July 20, 2012, we executed an agreement with Temple Mountain Energy, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (“TME”), to acquire TME’s assets.  On April 12, 2013, we determined not to proceed with the proposed transaction since the results of our due diligence investigation were not satisfactory.
 
On September 9, 2013, we executed an asset acquisition agreement with Solus Industries, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company (“Solus”) engaged in providing commercial roofing, heating/ventilation/air-conditioning and refrigeration systems.  Effective October 25, 2013, we terminated the asset acquisition agreement with Solus due to unsatisfactory results of our due diligence investigation.
 
As a result of the aforementioned acquisition agreement terminations, our ongoing plan of operations is to continue to seek, identify and acquire a suitable business.
 
On December 8, 2016, we entered into a mutually binding letter of intent to acquire Global CashSpot Corp (“GCS”). Under the terms of the letter of intent, we will issue 37,809,039 newly issued shares of the Company in exchange for all outstanding shares of GCS. Both parties intended that the transaction would close within 60 days, unless extended by mutual agreement of both parties. On February 8, 2017, the parties agreed to extend the date by which closing would occur to March 31, 2017.  As a condition precedent to closing, the Company will obtain all necessary shareholder authorizations to change its name to Global CashSpot Corp, and bring its SEC reporting obligations current. GCS is a financial technology company deploying a proprietary cross-border payment network that enables un-banked or self- banked consumers around the world to transfer money, via computer or mobile device from anywhere in the world using a branded prepaid debit card.
