The company plans to support 100 agricultural machinery companies, 1000 agricultural cooperatives, 5000 large agricultural farmers, to promote economy through modern planting and harvesting machinery. Chongqing CAT9 will work together with farmers to establish agricultural cooperatives, to help students, laid-off workers and veterans to establish micro-enterprises, in order to development both urban and rural areas so that, suppressed land and rural property can be activated. Chongqing CAT9 expects this initiative to begin developing in Q1 2017.
 Chongqing CAT9 is also engaged in the business of the purchase and sale of Acer Truncatum oil. We purchase raw material (oil) from suppliers in China and in turn bottle, package and ship our product back to the factory. Chongqing CAT9 uses sales agents who then sell direct to retail customers. Sales channels include online sales such as Taobao, T-Mall and Alibaba, and government agencies. The Company’s strategy is to process their own raw materials (oil) from the Acer Truncatum plant with land leases and developing a more direct approach that provides better economics to the Company. Recently the company has entered into the business of growing, harvesting and the production of edible oil with the acquisition of Acer Truncatum Plantations via two agreements which provide a total of 1400 Mu (230 Acres) of land in Yunnan Province, China. 
 Acer Truncatum is a plant that produces an extract from its leaf. Nervonic acid is the principal extract of the Acer Truncatum plant of which Acer Truncatum oil is derived. Nervonic acid is a rich omega-9 fatty acid that is known to be beneficial to memory related brain health, anti-aging, blood lipid regulation, and anti-fatigue symptoms. There are a few alternate sources where nervonic acid can be derived, however at much less yield than from an Acer Truncatum plant.

 Our funds are kept in financial institutions located in the PRC, which do not provide insurance for amounts on deposit. Moreover, we are subject to the regulations of the PRC, which restrict the transfer of cash from the PRC, except under certain specific circumstances. Accordingly, such funds may not be readily available to us to satisfy obligations which have been incurred outside the PRC.
 We generally finance our operations through operating profit and borrowings from our directors. As of the date of this Form 10-K Annual Report, we have not experienced any difficulties due to a shortage of capital, we have not experienced any difficulty in raising funds through loans from banks and financial institutions, and we have not experienced any liquidity problems in settling our payables in the normal course of business and repaying our loans when they come due. We are unaware of any trends, demands, commitments events or uncertainties that will result or be likely to result in material changes in our liquidity.
 We believe that the level of financial resources is a significant factor for our future development and accordingly, we may determine from time to time to raise capital through private debt or equity financing to strengthen our financial position, to expand our facilities and to provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising such additional capital on terms acceptable to us.
 
Competitive Advantages
 We believe that our competitive advantages include offering modern farming equipment and technology needed for productive and cost effective farming, utilizing Hi-Tech GPS crop machinery, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) drone technology, and cooperative management of growing, harvesting and delivery logistics. Our proximity to regional fruit production centers enables us to purchase fresh fruits directly from farmers, avoid the need to transport fresh fruit over long distances to processing facilities, reducing our transportation expenses and damage to fresh fruit during transportation and helps us maintain high quality of finished products by preserving freshness. In addition using innovative on-line off-line (O2O) marketing and distribution platform such as the WeChat mobile application allows the consumers to order their fresh foods directly to their door providing a much greater market penetration.
 Research and Development
 We will continue to research and develop new methods for Hi-Tech seeding, irrigation, growth monitoring and harvesting to enhance the yield and productivity for farmers.

Industry and Principal Markets
 Global Farm Management Market
 According to Markets and Markets, a market research firm, the global farm management market is poised to grow to over $5.5 billion in total market value by the end of 2020, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.64%. Global farm management products are highly segmented and are technology driven utilizing global positioning satellite technology (GPS), remote sensing, variable rate technology, hardware automation, yield, soil, water and climate sensing technology.
World Agricultural Equipment Market
 We also address the agricultural equipment market by offering heavy machinery and farm equipment to potential customers. This market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.6% to reach $302 billion by 2022 according to Statistics MRC. Key drivers to this growth are expected to be world population growth, increase for food production demand, and the need for mechanization of farming techniques.
Principal Markets
 We support farmers in the Chongqing region within China by marketing their products to customers through utilizing high technology platforms. Currently, this comprises the majority of our business activity. We expect to grow through expanding our business through additional lines of commerce such as offering heavy machinery and farm equipment to countries in Africa.
 Internationally, we have a strong focus in developing business relations in Africa due to favorable population demographics. Africa has consistently been ranked as one of the poorest regions for food security in the world. There are many factors that contribute to this issue such as weather extremes, unstable government, war, hyperinflation, lack of resources and political crisis. Despite these issues, management believes there are tremendous opportunities within the farm and agricultural equipment market in Africa.
 Chongqing CAT9seeks to provide Chinese farm management to areas which we are currently in negotiation with Fe Corporation in West Africa and have entered into a letter of intent, who has made available for our business over 72,000 square kilometers of land for agriculture development and 124,000 square kilometers of water for fishing rights. In addition to the requirement for farm management, Fe Corporation will purchase farm machinery and equipment to implement their project of which Chongqing CAT9has the ability to provide through its resource partnerships.
 In addition, Chongqing CAT9 has recently entered into negotiation with Grupo Bermejo, a company in Argentina for importing various products such as meat, wheat and corn. Due to recent policy changes and trade restrictions being lifted with Argentina, we expect positive results in expanding both the import of food products to China as well as exportation of equipment and machinery to the farmers in Argentina.

The PRC Market Customers
 The PRC has 20% of the world’s population, but only has 6% of arable land. This puts an incredible burden on the country and the government to fulfill the growing demands of China. Management believes that this will provide an excellent opportunity for our company to grow and be a major contributing factor in providing a solution to this challenging domestic problem. We are able to reach any customer who has access to the Internet and a mobile device. Our O2O initiative allows us to utilize high technology platforms such as the WeChat mobile application to reach our customers.
 Additionally, we believe that the increased health awareness of consumers and the quality of living powered by the PRC’s economic growth will continue to fuel the demand for fresh organic and non-organic food products.
 Competition 
 The markets in which we operate are competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to shifting customer demands and expectations. There are a number of companies that compete directly with our product offerings and some of our competitors have significantly more financial resources than we possess. These competitors however only use the internet and only one is national Yihaodian (yhd.com). The others Nogogo is located in southern China (nogogo.cn - Shenzhen), and Epermarket located in east China (epermarket.com - Shanghai).
 We believe our competitive advantages include our unique O2O marketing and logistics platform which will reach more customers than our competitor’s conventional methods, as there are no other companies currently providing this sales and distribution method.
 Strategy
 Our goal is to become a leading provider in farm food distribution and farm management equipment in China and overseas, particularly in Africa. We intend to achieve this goal by implementing the following strategies:

The National Labor Contract Law has enhanced rights for the nation's workers, including permitting open-ended labor contracts and severance payments. The legislation requires employers to provide written contracts to their workers, restricts the use of temporary labor and makes it harder for employers to lay off employees.
