ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

(a)  General Development of Business

On July 7, 2011, Ascent Media Corporation merged with its direct wholly-owned subsidiary, Ascent Capital Group, Inc. ("Ascent Capital", the "Company", "we, "us" and "our"), for the purpose of changing its name to Ascent Capital Group, Inc. Ascent Capital was incorporated in the state of Delaware on May 29, 2008 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Discovery Holding Company ("DHC"), a subsidiary of Discovery Communications, Inc. On September 17, 2008, Ascent Capital was spun off from DHC and became an independent, publicly traded company. The spin-off was intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction.

At December 31, 2017, our assets consisted primarily of our wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Monitronics International, Inc. ("MONI"), investments in marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents. 
At December 31, 2017, we had investments in marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents, on a consolidated basis, of $105,958,000 and $10,465,000, respectively.
MONI provides residential customers and commercial client accounts with monitored home and business security systems, as well as interactive and home automation services. MONI is supported by a network of independent Authorized Dealers providing products and support to customers in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. MONI’s wholly owned subsidiary, LiveWatch Security LLC (“LiveWatch”) is a Do-It-Yourself ("DIY") home security firm, offering professionally monitored security services through a direct-to-consumer sales channel.
In early 2017, MONI officially launched its own direct inside sales operations ("MONI Direct") targeting subscriber acquisitions through direct-to-consumer advertising primarily through internet, print and partnership program marketing activities. MONI now targets subscriber acquisitions through its Authorized Dealer program, LiveWatch DIY channel and the MONI Direct channel. 
Additionally, in the third quarter of 2017, MONI signed an agreement with Nest Labs, Inc. ("Nest") to offer professional monitoring for the Nest Secure alarm system, which was unveiled by Nest in September 2017. Nest Secure customers will typically install the system themselves. MONI launched professional monitoring services for the Nest Secure alarm system in December 2017 through the MONI Direct channel with further roll out planned for 2018. 
Recent Events
On February 26, 2018, MONI entered into an exclusive, long-term, trademark licensing agreement with The Brink’s Company ("Brink's"), which will result in a complete rebranding of MONI and LiveWatch as BRINKS Home Security.
Under the terms of the agreement, MONI will have exclusive use of the BRINKS and BRINKS Home Security trademarks related to the residential smart home and home security categories in the U.S. and Canada. MONI will pay Brink’s customary licensing fees and minimum and growth-based royalties that will increase overtime as the BRINKS Home Security brand is reintroduced. MONI expects to pay first-year royalties of approximately $5,000,000. The agreement provides for an initial term of seven years and, subject to certain conditions, allows for subsequent renewal periods whereby MONI can extend the agreement beyond 20 years.

(b)  Financial Information About Reportable Segments

We identify our reportable segments based on financial information reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. We report financial information for our consolidated business segments that represent more than 10% of our consolidated revenue or earnings before income taxes. Based on the foregoing criteria, we had two reportable segments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, MONI and LiveWatch.  For more information, see below and our financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business

Ascent Capital Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a holding company whose principal assets as of December 31, 2017 consisted of our wholly-owned operating subsidiary, MONI, investments in marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents.  Our principal executive office is located at 5251 DTC Parkway, Suite 1000, Greenwood Village, Colorado 80111, telephone number (303) 628-5600.

MONI and Subsidiaries

Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, MONI, we are one of the largest security alarm monitoring companies in North America, with customers under contract in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada. We offer:

• | monitoring services for alarm signals arising from burglaries, fires, medical alerts and other events through security systems at our customers' premises;


• | a comprehensive platform of home automation services, including, among other things, remote activation and control of security systems, support for video monitoring, flood sensors, automated garage door and door lock capabilities and thermostat integration, with mobile device accessibility provided through our proprietary mobile notification system;


• | hands‑free two‑way interactive voice communication between our monitoring center and our customers; and


• | customer service and technical support related to home monitoring systems and home automation services.


Revenue is generated primarily from fees charged to customers (or "subscribers") under alarm monitoring agreements ("AMAs"), which include access to interactive and automation features at a higher fee.  The monitored security systems are either professionally installed by licensed technicians or installed by the subscribers themselves for DIY product solutions.
For its professional installation option, MONI primarily outsources its sales and installation functions to its Authorized Dealer program, which is unlike many of its national competitors. By outsourcing the low margin, high fixed-cost elements of its business to a large network of independent service providers, MONI is able to allocate capital to growing its revenue-generating account base rather than to local offices or depreciating hard assets. MONI also acquires subscribers through its MONI Direct channel, which can then be professionally installed by internal employee technicians or through a network of third party service dealers, and through the LiveWatch DIY channel. Customer leads for these channels are typically obtained from direct-to-consumer marketing primarily via internet, print and through partnership programs. 
MONI generates incremental revenue through product and installation sales or by providing additional services, such as maintenance and wholesale contract monitoring. Contract monitoring includes fees charged to other security alarm companies for monitoring their accounts on a wholesale basis.  As of December 31, 2017, MONI provided contract monitoring services for approximately 76,000 accounts.  These incremental revenue streams do not represent a significant portion of our overall revenue.
MONI was incorporated in 1994 and is headquartered in Farmers Branch, Texas.
Sales and Marketing

Management continues to market the MONI brand directly to consumers through internet and print national advertising campaigns and partnerships with other subscription- or member-based organizations and businesses. This, coupled with the Authorized Dealer nationwide network, is an effective way for MONI to market alarm systems.  Locally-based dealers are often an integral part of the communities they serve and understand the local market and how best to satisfy local needs. By combining the dealer's local presence and reputation with MONI's nationally marketed brand, accompanied with its high quality service and support, MONI is able to cost-effectively provide local services and take advantage of economies of scale where appropriate. LiveWatch offers a differentiated go-to-market strategy through direct response TV, internet and radio advertising.

MONI's Authorized Dealer Program
MONI's authorized independent dealers are typically small businesses that sell and install alarm systems.  During 2017, MONI acquired AMAs from more than 345 dealers.  These dealers focus on the sale and installation of security systems and generally do not retain the monitoring contracts for their customers and do not have their own facilities to monitor such systems due to the large upfront investment required to create the account and build a monitoring station.  They also do not have the scale required to operate a monitoring station efficiently.  These dealers typically sell the contracts to third parties and outsource the monitoring function for any accounts they retain. The initial contract term for contracts generated by the dealers are typically three to five years, with automatic renewals annually or on a month-to-month basis depending on state and local regulations. MONI has the ability to monitor a variety of signals from nearly all types of residential security systems.
MONI generally enters into exclusive contracts with dealers under which the dealers sell and install security systems and MONI has a right of first refusal to acquire the associated AMAs.  In order to maximize revenues, MONI seeks to attract dealers from throughout the U.S. rather than focusing on specific local or regional markets.  In evaluating the quality of potential participants for the dealer program, MONI conducts an internal due diligence review and analysis of each dealer using information obtained from third party sources.  This process includes:

• | background checks on the dealer, including lien searches to the extent applicable; and


• | a review of the dealer's licensing status and creditworthiness.

Once a dealer is approved and signed as a MONI authorized dealer, the primary steps in creating an account are as follows:

1.              Dealer sells an alarm system to a homeowner or small business.
2.              Dealer installs the alarm system, which is monitored by MONI's central monitoring center, trains the customer on its use, and receives a signed three to five year contract for monitoring services.
3.              Dealer presents the account to MONI for acquisition.
4.              MONI performs diligence on the alarm monitoring account to validate quality.
5.              MONI acquires the customer contract at a formula-based cost.

MONI believes its ability to maximize its return on invested capital is largely dependent on the quality of the accounts acquired. MONI conducts a review of each account to be acquired through its dealer network.  This process typically includes:


• | subscriber credit score reviews;


• | telephone surveys to confirm satisfaction with the installation and security systems;


• | an individual review of each alarm monitoring contract;


• | confirmation that the customer is a homeowner; and


• | confirmation that each security system is monitored by MONI's central monitoring station prior to origination.


MONI generally acquires each new customer account from a dealer at a cost based on a multiple of the account's monthly recurring revenue. MONI's dealer contracts generally provide that if a customer account acquired by MONI is terminated within the first 12 months, the dealer must replace the account or refund the cost paid by MONI. To secure the dealer’s obligation, MONI typically holds back a percentage of the cost paid for the account.
Customer Integration and Marketing
MONI's dealers typically introduce customers to MONI in the home when describing MONI's central monitoring station.  Following the acquisition of a monitoring agreement from a dealer, the customer is notified that MONI is responsible for all their monitoring and customer service needs.  The customer's awareness and identification of MONI's brand as the monitoring service provider is further supported by the distribution of branded materials by the dealer to the customer at the point of sale. Such materials may include the promotional items listed below. All materials provided in the dealer model focus on the MONI brands and the role of MONI as the single source of support for the customer.
Dealer Network Development

MONI remains focused on expanding its network of independent authorized dealers. To do so, MONI has established a dealer program that provides participating dealers with a variety of support services to assist them as they grow their businesses. Authorized dealers may use the MONI brand name in their sales and marketing activities and on the products they sell and install. MONI authorized dealers benefit from their affiliation with MONI and its national reputation for high customer satisfaction, as well as the support they receive from MONI. MONI also provides authorized dealers with the opportunity to 
5

obtain discounts on alarm systems and other equipment purchased by such dealers from original equipment manufacturers.  MONI also makes available sales, business and technical training, sales literature, co-branded marketing materials, sales leads and management support to its authorized dealers.  In most cases these services and cost savings would not be available to security alarm dealers on an individual basis.

Currently, MONI employs sales representatives to promote its authorized dealer program, find account acquisition opportunities and sell MONI monitoring services. MONI targets independent alarm dealers across the U.S. that can benefit from the MONI dealer program services and can generate high quality monitoring customers for MONI. MONI uses a variety of marketing techniques to promote the dealer program and related services. These activities include direct mail, trade magazine advertising, trade shows, internet web site marketing, publicity and telemarketing. MONI has experienced success in implementing initiatives designed to improve lead sourcing for our dealers and for direct‑to‑consumer sales. Providing internally sourced leads to dealers strengthens our dealer relationships and serves as another mechanism for driving customer base growth. MONI has been named as an exclusive partner with several nationally recognized brands.
Dealer Marketing Support

MONI offers its authorized dealers an extensive marketing support program. MONI focuses on developing professionally designed sales and marketing materials that will help dealers market alarm systems and monitoring services with maximum effectiveness. Materials offered to authorized dealers include:

• | sales brochures and flyers;


• | yard signs;


• | window decals;


• | customer forms and agreements;


• | sales presentation binders;


• | door hangers;


• | vehicle graphics;


• | trade show booths; and


• | clothing bearing the MONI brand name.


These materials are made available to dealers at prices that MONI's management believes would not be available to dealers on an individual basis.

MONI's sales materials promote both the MONI brand and the dealer's status as a MONI authorized dealer. Dealers often sell and install alarm systems which display the MONI logo and telephone number, which further strengthens consumer recognition of their status as MONI authorized dealers. Management believes that the dealers' use of the MONI brand to promote their affiliation with one of the nation’s largest alarm monitoring companies boosts the dealers' credibility and reputation in their local markets and also assists in supporting their sales success.
Negotiated Account Acquisitions

In addition to the development of MONI's dealer network, MONI periodically acquires alarm monitoring accounts from other alarm companies in bulk on a negotiated basis. MONI's management has extensive experience in identifying potential opportunities, negotiating account acquisitions and performing thorough due diligence, which helps facilitate execution of new acquisitions in a timely manner.
MONI Direct 
The MONI Direct channel is a direct-response inside sales phone operation trained to sell home security solutions and acquire AMAs from prospective customers. MONI Direct has typically allowed for substantial discounts on alarm monitoring equipment to initiate subscriber contracts. However, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, MONI Direct began offering certain customers the ability to finance the purchase of alarm monitoring systems by contracting with a third party financing company. In this arrangement, the customer is typically charged the retail price for the alarm monitoring equipment and MONI receives the cash for the retail sale from the third party financing company. The customer has a separate contract with the third party financing company and is then responsible to make payments to them. The financing company has no recourse against MONI if the customer defaults on qualifying transactions. 
6

The initial monitoring contract term for AMAs generated by MONI Direct are typically three years, with automatic renewal on a month-to-month basis. MONI has the ability to monitor a variety of signals from nearly all types of residential security systems, including the Nest Secure product, which was unveiled in September 2017. 
MONI Customer Operations
Once a customer has contracted with MONI for services either through the Authorized Dealer program or the MONI Direct channel, MONI provides monitoring services as well as billing and 24-hour telephone support through its central monitoring station, located in Farmers Branch, Texas.  This facility is Underwriters Laboratories ("UL") listed.  To obtain and maintain a UL listing, an alarm monitoring center must be located in a building meeting UL's structural requirements, have back-up and uninterruptable power supplies, have secure telephone lines and maintain redundant computer systems.  UL conducts periodic reviews of alarm monitoring centers to ensure compliance with their requirements.  MONI's central monitoring station has also received the Monitoring Association’s prestigious Five Diamond certification. Five Diamond certification is achieved by having all alarm monitoring operators complete special industry training and pass an exam.

MONI has a back-up facility in Dallas, Texas that is capable of supporting monitoring and certain customer service operations in the event of a disruption at its primary monitoring and customer care center. 

MONI's telephone systems utilize high-capacity, high-quality, digital circuits backed up by conventional telephone lines. When an alarm signal is received at the monitoring facility, it is routed to an operator. At the same time, information concerning the subscriber whose alarm has been activated and the nature and location of the alarm signal is delivered to the operator's computer terminal. The operator is then responsible for following standard procedures to contact the subscriber or take other appropriate action, including, if the situation requires, contacting local emergency service providers.  MONI never dispatches its own personnel to the subscriber's premises in response to an alarm event.  If a subscriber lives in an area where the emergency service provider will not respond without verification of an actual emergency, MONI will contract with an independent third party responder if available in that area.
Security system interactive and home automation services are contracted with and provided by various third party technology companies to the subscriber.
MONI seeks to increase subscriber satisfaction and retention by carefully managing customer and technical service. The customer service center handles all general inquiries from subscribers, including those related to subscriber information changes, basic alarm troubleshooting, alarm verification, technical service requests and requests to enhance existing services. MONI has a proprietary centralized information system that enables it to satisfy over 90% of subscriber technical inquiries over the telephone, without dispatching a service technician. If the customer requires field service, MONI relies on its nationwide network of independent service dealers and over 85 employee field service technicians to provide such service.  MONI closely monitors service dealer performance with customer satisfaction forms, follow-up quality assurance calls and other performance metrics.  In 2017, MONI dispatched approximately 295 independent service dealers around the country to handle its field service.

LiveWatch DIY Channel and Customer Operations
LiveWatch is a leading DIY home security provider offering professionally monitored security services through a direct-to-consumer sales channel. Similar to MONI, LiveWatch is an asset-light business and geographically unconstrained. LiveWatch obtains subscribers through e-commerce online sales and through a trained inside sales phone operation. LiveWatch typically offers substantial equipment subsidies to initiate, renew or upgrade alarm monitoring service contracts. The initial contract term for LiveWatch AMAs is typically one year, with automatic renewal on a month-to-month basis.
When a customer initiates and completes the sales process to obtain alarm monitoring services, including signing an AMA, LiveWatch pre-configures the alarm monitoring system based on the customer's specifications. LiveWatch then packages and ships the equipment directly to the customer. The customer self installs the equipment on-site and activates the monitoring service over the phone. Technical support for installation is provided via telephone or online assistance via the LiveWatch website. Monitoring services are provided through a third party central monitoring station. Security system interactive and home automation services are contracted with and provided to the subscriber by various third party technology companies. LiveWatch has a customer care center to handle general inquiries from subscribers as well as engage in retention activities.
LiveWatch has operations in central Kansas and in a satellite office in Evanston, Illinois.

Customers
MONI believes its subscriber acquisition process, which includes both clearly defined customer account standards and a comprehensive due diligence process, contributes significantly to the high quality of its subscriber base. For each of its last five calendar years, the average credit score of accounts acquired by MONI was 715 or higher on the FICO scale.

Approximately 94% of MONI's subscribers are residential homeowners and the remainder are small commercial accounts. MONI believes that by focusing on residential homeowners, rather than renters, it can reduce attrition, because homeowners relocate less frequently than renters.
Intellectual Property

MONI has a registered service mark for the Monitronics name and a service mark for the Monitronics logo and also holds registered service marks for "MONI." LiveWatch has a registered service mark for the LiveWatch name and a service mark for the LiveWatch logo. We own certain proprietary software applications that are used to provide services to our dealers and subscribers, including various trademarks, patents and patents pending related to the "ASAPer" system employed by LiveWatch, which causes a predetermined group of recipients to receive a text message automatically once an alarm is triggered. Other than as mentioned above, we and our subsidiaries do not hold any patents or other intellectual property rights on our proprietary software applications.
Strategy

Corporate Strategy

Ascent Capital actively seeks opportunities to leverage our strong operating platform and capital position through strategic acquisitions and investments in the security alarm monitoring industry as well as other life safety industries.  
We continually evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities that we believe offer the opportunity for attractive returns on equity. In evaluating potential acquisition and investment candidates we consider various factors, including among other things:

• | opportunities that strategically align with our existing operations;


• | financial characteristics, including recurring revenue streams and free cash flow;


• | growth potential;


• | potential return on investment incorporating appropriate financial leverage, including the target's existing indebtedness and opportunities to restructure some or all of that indebtedness;


• | risk profile of business; and


• | the presence of a strong management team.


We consider acquisitions and investments utilizing cash, leverage and, potentially, Ascent Capital stock. In addition to acquisitions, we consider majority ownership positions, minority equity investments and, in appropriate circumstances, senior debt investments that we believe provide either a path to full ownership or control, the possibility for high returns on investment, or significant strategic benefits.

Our acquisition and investment strategy entails risk. While our preference is to build our presence in the security alarm monitoring industry through acquisitions, we will also consider potential acquisitions in other life safety industries, which could result in further changes in our operations from those historically conducted by us.  Please see "Risk Factors" below.

MONI Strategy

MONI's goal is to maximize return on invested capital, which it believes can be achieved by pursuing the following strategies:
Capitalize on Limited Market Penetration
MONI seeks to capitalize on what it views as the current limited market penetration in security services and grow its existing customer base through the following initiatives:

• | continue to develop its leading dealer position in the market to drive acquisitions of high quality AMAs;


• | leverage its acquisition of LiveWatch to competitively secure new DIY customers without significantly altering its existing asset‑light business model;


• | further develop internal lead sourcing through additional partnership opportunities to support existing direct marketing and acquisitions through its dealer program;

8


• | increase home integration, automation and ancillary product offerings; and


• | continue to monitor potential accretive merger and acquisition opportunities and further industry contraction.

Proactively Manage Customer Attrition
Customer attrition has historically been reasonably predictable and MONI regularly identifies and monitors the principal drivers thereof, including its customers' credit scores, which MONI believes are the strongest predictors of retention. MONI seeks to maximize customer retention by consistently offering high quality automated home monitoring services and increasing the average life of acquired AMAs through the following initiatives:

• | maintain the high quality of its customer base by continuing to implement its highly disciplined AMA acquisition program;


• | continue to motivate its dealers to obtain only high‑quality accounts through incentives built into purchase multiples and by having a performance guarantee on substantially all dealer originated accounts;


• | capitalize on its lead generation initiatives to supply high quality leads with strong retention indicators to its dealers;


• | prioritize the inclusion of interactive and home automation services in the AMAs its purchases, which it believes increases customer retention;


• | proactively identifying customers "at‑risk" for attrition through new technology initiatives, including statistical analysis of "big data";


• | improve customer care and first call resolution;


• | continue to implement initiatives to reduce core attrition, which include more effective initial on-boarding of customers, conducting customer surveys at key touchpoints and competitive retention offers for departing customers; and


• | utilize available customer data to actively identify customers who are relocating and target retention of such customers.

Maximize Economics of Business Model

Due to the scalability of its operations and the low fixed and variable costs inherent in its cost structure, MONI believes it will continue to experience high Adjusted EBITDA margins as costs are spread over increased recurring revenue streams. In addition, MONI optimizes the rate of return on investment by managing subscriber acquisition costs, or the costs of acquiring an account ("Subscriber Acquisition Costs"). Subscriber Acquisition Costs, whether capitalized or expensed, include the costs related to the direct-to-consumer channels for both MONI and LiveWatch and the costs to acquire alarm monitoring contracts from MONI's dealers and certain sales and marketing costs. MONI consistently offers what MONI views as competitive rates for account acquisition. MONI believes its cash flows may also benefit from its continued efforts to decrease its cost to serve by investing in customer service automation, targeting cost saving initiatives and integrating the operations of LiveWatch and MONI.  For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Grow Distribution Channels
MONI plans to expand AMA acquisitions by targeting new dealers from whom it expects to generate high quality customers. MONI believes that by providing dealers with a full range of services designed to assist them in all aspects of their business, including sales leads, sales training, technical training, comprehensive on‑line account access, detailed weekly account summaries, sales support materials and discounts on security system hardware purchased through our strategic alliances with security system manufacturers, it is able to attract and partner with dealers that will succeed in MONI's existing dealer network. 
Additionally, MONI expects its recent focus on internal lead sourcing and lead sourcing driven by relationships with third parties to contribute to the growth of its direct-to-consumer offerings (MONI Direct and LiveWatch) as well as its dealer network. These most recent efforts resulted in the partnership with Nest and adding the option for third party financing on the product sales, both as discussed above. MONI continues to evaluate these new relationships and how to maximize them by integrating them into its sales channels. MONI believes these strategies support an entrepreneurial culture at the dealer level and allow us to continue to grow our direct-to-consumer offerings.
For a description of the risks associated with the foregoing strategies, and with the Company's business in general, see "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS."

Industry; Competition

The security alarm industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Our competitors include two other major security alarm companies with nationwide coverage, numerous smaller providers with regional or local coverage and certain large multi-service organizations in the telecommunications or cable businesses. Our significant competitors for obtaining subscriber AMA's are:

• | ADT, Inc. ("ADT");


• | Vivint, Inc.;


• | Guardian Protection Services;


• | Vector Security, Inc.;


• | Comcast Corporation; and


• | SimpliSafe, Inc.

Competition in the security alarm industry is based primarily on reputation for quality of service, market visibility, services offered, price and the ability to identify and obtain customer accounts. Competition for customers has also increased in recent years with the emergence of DIY home security providers and other technology companies expanding into the security alarm industry. We believe we compete effectively with other national, regional and local alarm monitoring companies, including cable and telecommunications companies, due to our reputation for reliable monitoring, customer and technical services, the quality of our services, and our relatively lower cost structure. We believe the dynamics of the security alarm industry favor larger alarm monitoring companies, such as MONI, with a nationwide focus that have greater resources and benefit from economies of scale in technology, advertising and other expenditures.
Some of these security alarm companies have also adopted, in whole or in part, a dealer program similar to that of MONI.  In these instances, MONI must also compete with these programs in recruiting dealers.  MONI believes it competes effectively with other dealer programs due to the quality of its dealer support services and its competitive acquisition terms.  Our significant competitors for recruiting dealers are:

• | ADT;


• | Central Security Group, Inc.;


• | Guardian Protection Services, Inc.; and


• | Vector Security, Inc.

Seasonality

MONI's operations are subject to a certain level of seasonality.  Since more household moves take place during the second and third calendar quarters of each year, MONI's disconnect rate and expenses related to retaining customers are typically higher in those calendar quarters than in the first and fourth quarters.  There is also a slight seasonal effect resulting in higher new customer volume and related cash expenditures incurred in investment in new subscribers in the second and third quarters.
Regulatory Matters

MONI's operations are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and licensing requirements of federal, state and local authorities including federal and state customer protection laws. In certain jurisdictions, MONI is required to obtain licenses or permits to comply with standards governing employee selection and training and to meet certain standards in the conduct of its business.  The security industry is also subject to requirements imposed by various insurance, approval, listing and standards organizations. Depending upon the type of subscriber served, the type of security service provided and the requirements of the applicable local governmental jurisdiction, adherence to the requirements and standards of such organizations is mandatory in some instances and voluntary in others.
Although local governments routinely respond to panic and smoke/fire alarms, there are an increasing number of local governmental authorities that have adopted or are considering various measures aimed at reducing the number of false burglar alarms. Such measures include:

• | subjecting alarm monitoring companies to fines or penalties for false alarms;


• | imposing fines on alarm subscribers for false alarms;


• | imposing limitations on the number of times the police will respond to false alarms at a particular location;


• | requiring additional verification of intrusion alarms by calling two different phone numbers prior to dispatch ("Enhanced Call Verification"); and

10


• | requiring visual verification of an actual emergency at the premise before the police will respond to an alarm signal.


Enhanced Call Verification has been implemented as standard policy by MONI.

Security alarm systems monitored by MONI utilize telephone lines, internet connections, cellular networks and radio frequencies to transmit alarm signals. The cost of telephone lines, and the type of equipment which may be used in telephone line transmission, are currently regulated by both federal and state governments. The operation and utilization of cellular and radio frequencies are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission and state public utility commissions.

For additional information on the regulatory frame work in which MONI operates, please see "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Factors Relating to Regulatory Matters."
