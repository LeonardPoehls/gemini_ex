GENERAL
 
The current business activities of the Company entail: (i) the owning and leasing of electronic gaming machines (EGMs) placed in gaming venues in the Philippines on a revenue-sharing (participation) basis with venue owners; and (ii) the development and testing of a social gaming platform designed for the Pan-Asian markets.
 
For our gaming operations in the Philippines, we utilize our operational experience to acquire EGMs, casino management systems and other gaming peripherals directly from manufacturers, dealers and suppliers and install the same in our contracted venues. In addition, we assist in brand-building and marketing promotions. In one location, we are also the venue owner. In this venue, we design marketing programs and hire, train and manage the floor staff and set high expectations on the level of customer service.
 
Our social gaming operations commenced in the second half of 2015. We have developed a social gaming platform and a social casino games application called City of Games which is focused on the Pan-Asian markets. In August 2016, we began initial testing of a limited version of City of Games in a single market in the Philippines. Since then, we have expanded the testing to include additional countries and features, such as third-party licensed slot content and a rewards platform which enables players to redeem accumulated points for reward items. We have also commenced development of another non-casino style application intended exclusively for the Mainland China market. This application remains in the early stages of development. We are continuing to explore and develop a business model for the commercial exploitation of the platform and applications.
 
During the reported periods, our gaming operations also included operations in Cambodia. In these locations, we also functioned as a manager of the EGM operations and either jointly managed with the relevant casino owner or exclusively managed the floor operations and designed marketing programs and promotions for our designated gaming spaces. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we terminated all our EGM participation and leasing agreements in Cambodia and sold all our gaming assets associated with these operations in three separate transactions. In addition, we developed and operated a small regional gaming casino Dreamworld Casino (Pailin), which was open from May 2012 to June 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold 100% of the issued share capital of Dreamworld Leisure (Pailin) Limited, our wholly-owned Cambodian subsidiary established for the purpose of owning and operating Dreamworld Casino (Pailin), to a local Cambodian individual and relative of our partner in the operations.

We also operated a gaming products business, which entailed the design, manufacture and distribution of gaming chips and plaques as well as the distribution of third-party gaming products. On May 11, 2016, we sold the principal assets of these operations and exited this business.
 
All related historical revenues and expenses for the Cambodia gaming operations and gaming products business have been reclassified as discontinued operations. The accounting policies of these discontinued operations are consistent with our policies for the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  
 
We have offices in Hong Kong, Mainland China, Cambodia, the Philippines and the United States.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we owned or had rights to certain trademarks that we used in connection with our discontinued gaming products operations, including, but not limited to Dolphin™.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and through the date of this report, we have carried out the following corporate actions and transactions:
 
We entered into a management services agreement with Melco Services Limited. On January 27, 2016, we entered into a management services agreement with Melco Services Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Melco International Development Limited, which is also the parent of our majority shareholder, EGT Entertainment Holding Limited. The agreement was approved by the conflicts committee and audit committee of our board of directors and pertains to the provision of specific management and administrative services by Melco Services Limited to us. The agreement became effective on January 1, 2015 and will continue until termination by either party, for any reason, upon 30 days prior written notice. Total consideration for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was HK$1.8 million and HK$1.6 million (approximately $232,000 and $206,000 based on the exchange rate of HK$1 to US$0.129), respectively. In future years, we will pay to Melco Services Limited a service fee for each year to be agreed upon by the parties in a timely fashion early in the relevant year.
    As part of our efforts to refocus our business operations, in 2016, we sold assets and exited certain businesses, which has significantly reduced our base of operations.

The purchase price was paid in full and the transaction closed on July 6, 2016. We had placed EGMs in NagaWorld on a participation basis from January 2009 to February 2016 and had leased EGMs on a fixed lease basis from March 2016 to June 2016. NagaWorld had been a primary contributor to our operating results and cash flows.

In addition, GPIC is obligated to make earn out payments to us over the next five years, or longer in the case of sales to our related parties, based on varying percentages of net revenues on certain select sales to specific Asian-based casinos. Also that day, GPIC agreed to irrevocably withdraw, terminate and discontinue certain legal action between the parties.
 
The above asset sale represented our exit from the table game equipment business and, as part of the transaction, we each agreed not to engage in the manufacture of table game equipment in competition with GPIC.
 
Our shareholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 38 million to 250 million. At our annual meeting of stockholders held on November 22, 2016 (Hong Kong time), our shareholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 38 million to 250 million. Our board of directors believed it is in our best interests to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock in order to give us greater flexibility in considering and planning for future corporate needs and to enable us to take timely advantage of market conditions and favorable financing and acquisition opportunities that become available to us without the delay and expense associated with convening a special meeting of our stockholders. Any newly authorized shares of our common stock will be identical to the shares of our common stock now authorized and outstanding. The amendment will not affect the rights of current holders of our common stock, none of whom have preemptive or similar rights to acquire our newly authorized shares.

GAMING BUSINESS

Slot Operations
 
Overview
 
Since September 2007, our business model has included the ownership and leasing of EGMs placed with venue owners on a revenue-sharing, or participation basis in Cambodia and the Philippines. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our operations in Cambodia also included leasing EGMs on a fixed fee basis. As of December 31, 2016, we had exited the EGM participation and leasing business in Cambodia and presently our EGM operations are located solely in the Philippines.
 
We contract with the venue owners or operators for the placement of EGMs and directly acquire and install the EGMs and other gaming peripherals at the relevant gaming venues. The target market for our EGM leasing operations has been hotels and various other gaming venues in certain markets in Pan-Asia where often many venue owners have little or no gaming operations experience.
 
We utilize EGMs from leading manufacturers, including Aristocrat Technologies, International Game Technology and WMS Gaming. As of December 31, 2016, we had an inventory of 155 EGMs suitable for deployment but not in use. However, it is possible that we may supplement our existing inventory with the purchase of a limited number of new and used EGMs from cash on hand and cash from operations over the next twelve months.
 
We help to market, design and develop the gaming venues of the venue owners to whom we lease our EGMs and related systems. We contract with the venue owners for the leasing and maintenance of the EGMs on a revenue-sharing basis. We also provide the development and implementation of various related gaming services in the Pan-Asia region which include:
 

· | Developing the technical and network design, layout and overall space configuration of the gaming floor in order to best utilize and leverage the available space and present an appealing environment to customers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Selecting the mix of EGMs for the property to optimize the economic potential of the gaming floor and overall experience for the venue owners’ customers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We assist the venue owners by recruiting and training the necessary gaming floor personnel for the operations and maintenance of the EGMs and back-of-the-house accounting. In one case, where we are the venue owner, the gaming floor personnel are our employees. In addition, we maintain all performance data and provide ongoing technical and operations support in order to optimize game performance throughout the gaming floor.
 
By utilizing our developed operational experience and established market presence and key relationships, we identify and secure venues for the placement of EGMs and, where warranted, casino management systems that track game performance and provide statistics on each installed EGM owned and leased by us. We contract with the venue owners or operators for the placement of the EGMs on a revenue-sharing basis, and we acquire and install the EGMs and other gaming systems and peripherals at the relevant gaming venues. 
 
EGM operations revenue and gross margin are influenced by a number of factors, including the number and type of EGMs in service, the levels of play and the revenue-sharing percentages. Cost of EGM operations includes depreciation and amortization, other operating expenses and other installation and maintenance costs of the EGMs.
 
As of December 31, 2016, our EGM operations were located solely in the Philippines, where we had 411 EGM seats in operation in two venues. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we had EGM operations in Cambodia, which included a total of approximately 1,000 EGM seats in operation in three venues. These EGMs were sold and the machine operation and participation agreements and leasing contract were terminated during the year ended December 31, 2016 (see Recent Developments).
 
Total gaming operations revenue comprised essentially 100% of consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
Competition
 
The global gaming industry is highly competitive. Our competitors principally include both public and private companies with operations focused on the Asian market. Part of our operating strategy includes addressing markets and customers where we face less competition and entry barriers are higher due to several factors including:

6
-


· | United States Gaming Laws: All of the major gaming equipment suppliers are licensed by a large number of United States regulatory agencies. In order for one of these companies to enter the markets we serve in Asia on a direct revenue sharing model with a foreign operator, the operator would be required to comply with various United States regulatory procedures. We are not subject to this requirement as we currently do not have any gaming licenses in the United States.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Local Knowledge: Through our operating experience, we have contacts and relationships in the Pan-Asia region that we believe provide us with an advantage in these markets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gaming Regulations and Licensing
 
In the Philippines, EGM leasing operations require the venue owners to obtain the necessary gaming licenses in order to operate the EGMs leased by us and we demand that all venue owners to whom we lease EGMs, being our customers in the Philippines, hold the required gaming licenses to operate their venues. Since our EGM leasing business model primarily focuses on leasing EGMs to the venue owners, technically, we are not considered to be an operator or owner of the gaming operations by the relevant authorities (although to a certain extent we have assumed some operator roles, including but not limited to the design of marketing programs, recruitment, training and management of floor staff, in certain of our venues) and thus, we are not required to obtain any form of gaming licenses in the Philippines for our EGM leasing business. However, current gaming laws, including licensing requirements and other regulatory obligations, could change or become more stringent resulting in additional regulations being imposed upon us and our EGM leasing operations. Any such adverse developments in the regulation of the gaming industry could be difficult to comply with and significantly increase our costs which, in turn, could cause our EGM leasing business to cease to be viable.
 
We previously held a formal gaming license issued by the Cambodian government in July 2012 to operate a casino in Pailin, which was sold during the year ended December 31, 2015.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
Our social gaming business is significantly based on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, trade secrets and other proprietary information that we use to develop our games and to enable them to run properly on multiple platforms. Other intellectual property we create includes product and feature names and audio-visual elements, including graphics, music and interface design.
 
While most of the intellectual property we use is created by us, we have also acquired rights to proprietary intellectual property. We have also obtained rights to use intellectual property through licensing agreements with third parties. These licenses typically limit our use of intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods.
 
We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law protections, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We also actively engage in monitoring and enforcement activities with respect to infringing uses of our proprietary intellectual property rights by third parties.
 
We typically own the copyright to the software code to our content, as well as the trademark for the brand or title under which our games are marketed. We have one trademark “成金一擊” registered under Class 9 under Trade Marks Ordinance (Chapter 559) in Hong Kong.

EMPLOYEES
 
As of March 15, 2017, we had approximately 11 full-time employees in Hong Kong, 23 full-time employees in the United States and 26 full-time employees in the Philippines. None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we consider our relationships with employees to be satisfactory.
