ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
MPM Holdings Inc. (“Momentive”) is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its business through its subsidiaries. Momentive’s wholly owned subsidiary, MPM Intermediate Holdings Inc. (“Intermediate Holdings”), is a holding company for its wholly owned subsidiary, Momentive Performance Materials Inc. (“MPM”) and its subsidiaries. 
As a result of MPM’s reorganization and emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 24, 2014 (the “Effective Date” or the “Emergence Date”) (described below), Momentive became the indirect parent company of MPM in accordance with MPM’s plan of reorganization (the “Plan”) pursuant to MPM’s emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on the Emergence Date. Prior to its reorganization, MPM, through a series of intermediate holding companies, was controlled by investment funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Management Holdings, L.P. (together with Apollo Global Management, LLC and subsidiaries, “Apollo”).
Momentive along with its subsidiaries is one of the world's largest producers of silicones, silicone derivatives and functional silanes. Momentive is a global leader in the development and manufacture of products derived from quartz and specialty ceramics. 
Products and Markets
Our products are used in thousands of applications and are sold into diverse markets, such as industrial, building and construction, transportation, agriculture, electronics, healthcare, personal care, semiconductor and fiber optics. The diversity of our products limits our dependence on any one market or end-use. We have a history of product innovation and success in introducing new products to new markets, as evidenced by more than 3,400 patents, the majority of which relate to the development of new products and manufacturing processes.
As of December 31, 2016, we had 23 production sites strategically located around the world, which allows us to produce the substantial majority of our key products locally in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Through this network of production facilities, we serve more than 4,000 customers between our Silicones and Quartz businesses in over 100 countries worldwide. We use our global platform to deliver products to companies efficiently on a worldwide basis. Many of our customers are expanding internationally to serve developing areas in Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, India and Russia. Maintaining close proximity to our international customers allows us to serve them more quickly and efficiently and thus build strong relationships. Our customers include leading companies in their respective industries.
We believe that our scale and global reach provide significant efficiencies in our fixed and variable cost structure and that our breadth of related products provides significant operational, technological and commercial advantages. Manufacturing capacity at our internal sites and our joint venture in China is sufficient to produce the majority of one of our key intermediates, siloxane, which facilitates a cost effective operating structure and security of supply.

We believe we have created a value-added, technical service-oriented business model that enables us to target and participate in high-margin and high-growth specialty markets. These specialty markets account for the majority of our revenues and continue to be a growing part of our business.
 Growth and Strategy
We believe that we have opportunities for growth through the following long-term strategies: 
Expand Our Global Reach in Faster Growing Regions—We intend to continue to grow by expanding our sales presence and application support around the world. Specifically, we are focused on growing our business in the high growth regions of Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, Latin America, India and the Middle East, where the usage of our products is increasing. 
Develop and Market New Products—We will continue our efforts to expand our product offerings through research and development initiatives and research partnership formations with third parties. Through these innovation initiatives we expect to create new generations of products and services which will continue to drive revenue and earnings growth over the long term. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we invested $64, $65 and $76, respectively, in research and development. In recent years we have completed such initiatives as upgrading technology facilities at our Tarrytown, NY site, implementing a full scale pilot line for our coatings business in Leverkusen, Germany, expanding our technology center in Seoul, Korea, and opening a research and development facility in Bangalore, India, all of which further complement our network of innovation centers strategically located to support our customers globally.
Increase Shift to High-Margin Specialty Products—We proactively manage our product portfolio with a focus on specialty, high-margin products. We continue to invest in growth as demonstrated by our recent announcement related to NXT* silane expansion in Leverkusen, Germany anticipated to be operational in 2017.
 In addition, we recently acquired the operating assets of Sea Lion Technology, Inc to further support the Silanes business. We previously had a tolling relationship with Sea Lion Technology, Inc. on their site, so these assets are well known to us. We believe the acquisition will enable us to further strategically leverage these assets in support of our NXT* silane business.
These actions enable us to strategically invest in a specialty growth platform and rationalize commodity-oriented siloxane capacity. The actions we are taking to lower costs, transform operations and invest in profitable growth will enhance our competitiveness in the current market environment and position us well when end markets recover.
*NXT is a trademark of Momentive Performance Materials Inc.
Continue Portfolio Optimization and Pursue Targeted Add-On Acquisitions and Joint Ventures—As a large manufacturer of performance materials, with leadership in the production of silicone, silicone derivatives, quartz and specialty ceramics, we have an advantage in pursuing add-on acquisitions and joint ventures in areas that allow us to build upon our core strengths, expand our product, technology and geographic portfolio and better serve our customers. We believe we will have the opportunity to consummate acquisitions at relatively attractive valuations due to the scalability of our existing global operations and deal-related synergies.
Implement Strategic Cost Reduction Initiatives—Pursuant to our earlier announcements during the fourth quarter of 2015 and as expanded in March and May of 2016, approximately $35 in annual structural cost reduction initiatives through our global restructuring program have been implemented and have begun delivering savings, of which approximately $29 were delivered in 2016. At the same time, we initiated strategic actions to address our global siloxane manufacturing capacity including, transformation of our Leverkusen, Germany facility by rationalizing siloxane capacity and making further investments in specialty assets through the NXT* silanes expansion, which is on track. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed the siloxane rationalization at our Leverkusen, Germany facility and it will reduce operating costs by approximately $10 per year. We have incurred approximately $17 in costs associated with the restructuring initiative as of December 31, 2016, which primarily represents severance expenses. The targeted savings are being achieved primarily through a reduction in force and delayering of our organization mostly in selling, general and administrative roles, as well as productivity actions at our operating facilities.
Leverage Cost Savings from the Shared Services Agreement—The Shared Services Agreement with Hexion Inc. (“Hexion”) has resulted in significant synergies for us. The Shared Services Agreement remains in place between MPM and Hexion following completion of our balance sheet restructuring, and both companies will continue to work together to benefit from the optimized cost structure and services that it provides.
Industry and Competitors
We compete with a variety of companies, including large global chemical companies and small specialty chemical companies, in each of our product lines.The principal factors of competition in our industry include product quality, customer service and breadth of product offerings, product innovation, manufacturing efficiency, distribution and price.

Silicones
2016 Net Sales: $2,061
We believe we are one of the world’s largest producers of silicones, silicone derivatives and organofunctional silanes, with leading positions in various product lines and geographic areas. We manufacture a wide range of high-performing elastomers, engineered materials and fluids. Silicones are generally used as an additive to a wide variety of end products in order to provide or enhance certain of their attributes, such as resistance (heat, ultraviolet light and chemical), lubrication, adhesion or viscosity. Silicones are used in product formulations primarily due to two distinguishing factors: (i) their high degree of inertness (resistance to heat, electricity and chemical reactions); and (ii) the ability during manufacturing to greatly modify their viscosity, enabling production of end-products with significant variation in levels of lubricity or adhesion. Silicones are developed using various finishing processes to generate a wide variety of different performance characteristics and are typically used in applications where traditional materials cannot perform under required conditions. Entirely new applications for silicones continue to emerge as a result of their versatility and broad range of both physical and chemical properties. We have a broad range of specialty silicones technologies, with highly advanced research, applications development and technical service capabilities.
Products
Our silicones product portfolio consists primarily of those set forth below. 

• | Fluids— Fluids products are polydimethylsiloxane polymers, co-polymers, elastomers and gel networks, high-performance antifoams and emulsions. Silicone fluids exhibit low surface tension, excellent gloss, excellent sensory, softening and conditioning properties, good thermal stability and excellent viscosity over a wide temperature range, which permits usage in a number of applications. Fluids are used primarily in the personal care, home care and auto care, textiles, oil and gas, agriculture and industrial end-markets and are sold under the Magnasoft, Sagtex, Formasil, Silwet, Silsoft, Silshine, Tospearl and Velvesil brands.

End-Markets and Applications
The physical properties of silicones, such as weather-ability, longevity and tolerance to a wide temperature range, make them versatile products with broad commercial applications. In the building and construction industry, silicone sealants and caulks are used to seal expansion and control joints in pre-cast exterior concrete panels and metal curtain walls, as well as in siding, window and door perimeters. In the transportation industry, silicones are used in a variety of original equipment manufacturer and aftermarket applications. In the electronics industry, silicones’ tolerance to high temperatures give them a considerable advantage relative to other traditional materials in a variety of computer and electronic manufacturing applications. In the personal care industry, silicones are used in consumer goods such as hair care and shaving products, antiperspirants and deodorants, cosmetics and shower and bath products. In the healthcare industry, silicones are used in medical equipment, as well as in surgeries and other general medical procedures. We believe that such a broad range of commercial uses not only helps to maintain a steady demand for our products in industries that are less vulnerable to economic cycles, but also allows for continuous innovation leading into new applications for our products in high-growth industries.
Raw Materials

• | Silicon Metal— Silicon metal is an inorganic material that is not derived from petrochemicals. Major silicon metal suppliers include Ferroglobe PLC, Elkem ASA, Lao Silicon Ltd., CBC Co. Ltd., and other smaller vendors located around the world. We currently purchase silicon metal under short-term, one-year or multi-year contracts and in the spot market. We typically purchase silicon metal under formal contracts in the United States and in the spot market in Asia Pacific.


• | Siloxane— Siloxane is a key intermediate required to produce silicone polymers. We are one of two producers in the silicones market with global siloxane production capacity. We produce siloxane for our internal use in Waterford, NY and Ohta, Japan and source siloxane from our joint venture in Jiande, China and third parties. We also source siloxane under a purchase and sale agreement with Asia Silicones Monomer Limited (“ASM”) and from time to time, we enter into supply agreements with other third parties to take advantage of favorable pricing and minimize our costs.


• | Methanol— Methanol is a key raw material for the production of methyl chloride, which is used to produce chlorosilanes. Major methanol suppliers include Itochu Chemical Forontier Corporation, CBC Co. Ltd., Southern Chemical Corporation, and Mitsubishi Gas Chemicals. We typically enter into quarterly or annual contracts for methanol.

Quartz
2016 Net Sales: $172
We believe that our Quartz business is a global leader in the development and manufacturing of fused quartz and ceramic materials. Fused quartz, a man-made glass manufactured principally from quartz sand, is used in processes requiring extreme temperature, high purity and other specific characteristics. Fused quartz and ceramic materials are used in a wide range of industries, including semiconductor, lamp tubing, manufacturing, packaging, cosmetics and fiber optics. We believe that our Quartz business is a leading global producer of quartz tubing, ingots and crucibles and high-performance, non-oxide ceramic powders, coatings and solids.
Products
Our Quartz business’ products are used as a superior substitute for glass. On a microscopic level, normal glass is filled with impurities, bubbles and other flaws. For this reason, applications that require transparency and a high level of purity or stress-resistance (such as process equipment for semiconductor manufacturing or lamp lenses for high intensity video projectors) require the use of quartz. A significant driver of our Quartz volumes derives from semiconductor chip manufacturers adding to or adjusting their manufacturing lines for newly developed products. The manufacture of quartz products for use in the production of semiconductors generated approximately 72% of our Quartz business’ revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 71% and 65% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Raw Materials
Naturally occurring quartz sand is the key raw material for many of the products manufactured by our Quartz business, which is currently available from a limited number of suppliers. The Unimin Corporation (“Unimin”), a major producer of natural quartz sand, controls a significant portion of the market for this sand. As a result, Unimin exercises significant control over quartz sand prices, which have been steadily increasing. In recent years, these increases have averaged approximately 3-5% per year. In April 2015, we entered into a purchase agreement with Unimin, which expired on December 31, 2016. We are currently negotiating the terms of a new long term supply agreement with Unimin, and expect to enter into an agreement within the first half of 2017. Since the expiration of our agreement with Unimin, purchases from Unimin have been handled through purchase orders without disruption of supply to our Quartz business and we expect that process to continue if we are unable to enter into a new agreement. We also use quartz sand from other global sand suppliers.
Raw Material Purchases
Overall, in 2016, we purchased approximately $846 of raw materials. Many of the raw materials we use to manufacture our products are available from more than one source, and are readily available in the open market. As discussed above, we currently purchase under short-term, one-year or multi-year contracts and in the spot market so as to ensure competitive pricing and adequate supply.

Marketing, Customers and Seasonality
We market an extensive product line to meet a wide variety of customer needs. We focus on customers who are, or have the potential to be, leaders in their industries and have growth objectives that support our own growth objectives. In addition, we focus on customers who value our service-oriented business model. This approach includes high-quality, reliable products backed by local sales support and technical expertise. An important component of our strategy is to utilize our broad product capabilities to win high-end specialty business from our customers. These customers value these capabilities and, as a result, we are able to become a supplier of choice, given our relationship and ability to develop solutions to meet their precise needs.
In 2016, our largest customer accounted for less than 3% of our net sales, and our top twenty customers accounted for approximately 28% of our net sales. Neither our overall Company nor any of our businesses depends on any single customer or a particular group of customers; therefore, the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on any of our businesses or the Company as a whole.
We do not experience significant seasonality of demand, although sales have historically been slightly higher during the second and fourth quarters due to increased industrial activity. Seasonality trends, however, have been skewed in recent years primarily due to volatile global economic conditions.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses include wages and benefits for research personnel, including engineers and chemists; payments to consultants and outside testing services; costs of supplies and chemicals used in in-house laboratories; and costs of research and development facilities. Our research and development efforts focus on the development of new applications for our existing products and technological advances that we hope will lead to new products. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we spent $64, $65 and $76, respectively, on research and development.
Intellectual Property
We own, license or have rights to approximately 3,400 patents and approximately 170 trademarks registered in a variety of countries, along with various patent and trademark applications and technology licenses around the world. These patents will expire between 2017 and 2035. Our rights under such patents and licenses are a significant strategic asset in the conduct of our business. Patents, patent applications, trademarks and trademark applications relating to our Velvesil, Silwet, Silsoft, Tospearl, SPUR+ and NXT brands, technologies and products are considered material to our business.
Solely for convenience, the trademarks, service marks and tradenames referred to in this report are without the “®” and “TM” symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the rights of the applicable licensors to these trademarks, service marks and tradenames.
Industry Regulatory Matters
Domestic and international laws regulate the production and marketing of chemical substances. Although almost every country has its own legal procedure for registration and import, laws and regulations in the European Union, the United States, and China are the most significant to our business. These laws typically prohibit the import or manufacture of chemical substances unless the substances are registered or are on the country's chemical inventory list, such as the European inventory of existing commercial chemical substances and the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act inventory. Chemicals that are on one or more of these lists can usually be registered and imported without requiring additional testing in countries that do not have such lists, although additional administrative hurdles may exist. Under such laws, countries may also require toxicity testing to be conducted on chemicals in order to register them or may place restrictions on the import, manufacture and/or use of a chemical.
The European Commission enacted a regulatory system in 2006, known as Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances (“REACH”), which requires manufacturers, importers and consumers of certain chemicals to register these chemicals and evaluate their potential impact on human health and the environment. As REACH matures, significant market restrictions could be imposed on the current and future uses of chemical products that we use as raw materials or that we sell as finished products in the European Union. Other countries may also enact similar regulations.
In the European Union and other jurisdictions committed to compliance with the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, there is an increasing likelihood that our manufacturing sites will be affected in some way over the next few years by taxation of greenhouse gas, or GHG emissions. In addition, although the United States is not a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, several states, including California and New York, are implementing their own GHG regulatory programs, and the enactment of federal climate change legislation in the United States is a possibility for the future. While only a small number of our sites are currently affected by existing GHG regulations, and none have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result, it is likely that GHG emission restrictions will increase over time. Potential consequences of such restrictions include increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. Currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites.
Environmental Regulations
Our policy is to strive to operate our plants in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities. We have implemented company-wide environmental, health and safety policies and practices managed by our 
 7

Environmental, Health and Safety, or EH&S department, and overseen by the EH&S Committee of the Board of Directors of MPM Holdings Inc. Our EH&S department has the responsibility to ensure that our operations worldwide comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. This responsibility is executed via training, communication of EH&S policies, formulation of relevant policies and standards, EH&S audits and incident response planning and implementation. Our EH&S policies and practices include management systems and procedures relating to environmental emissions, waste generation, process safety management, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, worker health and safety requirements, emergency planning and response and product stewardship.
Our operations involve the use, handling, processing, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental regulation at the federal, state and international level. Our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal or modification. Violations of environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on operating activities, substantial fines, penalties, damages or other costs. In addition, statutes such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and comparable state and foreign laws impose strict, joint and several liability for investigating and remediating the consequences of spills and other releases of hazardous materials, substances and wastes at current and former facilities and at third-party disposal sites. Other laws permit individuals to seek recovery of damages for alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to hazardous substances and conditions at or from our facilities or to hazardous substances otherwise owned, sold or controlled by us. Therefore, notwithstanding our commitment to environmental management, environmental health and safety, we may incur liabilities in the future, and these liabilities may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Although our environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with international, federal and state laws and environmental regulations, future developments and increasingly stringent regulation could require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures.
We expect to incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under environmental laws, including costs to acquire, maintain and repair pollution control equipment. In 2016, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $24 on an aggregate basis to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to make other environmental improvements. We estimate that our capital expenditures in 2017 for environmental controls at our facilities will be approximately $20. This estimate is based on current regulations and other requirements, but it is possible that a material amount of capital expenditures, in addition to those we currently anticipate, could be necessary if these regulations or other requirements or other facts change.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 4,900 employees, flat compared to 2015. Approximately 45% of our employees are members of a labor union or have collective bargaining agreements. The new contract involving the Local 81359 and Local 81380 unions in our Waterford, NY site and Local 84707 union in our Willoughby, OH site was ratified by union membership in February 2017 and is effective until June 2019.
Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Filing and Emergence
On April 13, 2014 (the “Petition Date”), Momentive Performance Materials Holdings Inc. (MPM’s direct parent prior to October 24, 2014) (“Old MPM Holdings”), MPM, and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization (the “Bankruptcy Filing”) under Chapter 11 (“Chapter 11”) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Court”). The Chapter 11 proceedings were jointly administered under the caption In re MPM Silicones, LLC, et al., Case No. 14-22503. MPM continued to operate our businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Court until our emergence from the Chapter 11 proceedings.
On September 11, 2014, the Court confirmed the plan of reorganization proposed by the Debtors (the “Plan”), and on October 24, 2014 (the “Effective Date) the Plan became effective and MPM emerged from the Chapter 11 proceedings. Upon emergence from bankruptcy on the Effective Date, we adopted fresh-start accounting which resulted in the creation of a new entity (such entity, the “Successor Company”) for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of the Company on or after October 24, 2014 are not comparable with the consolidated financial statements of the Company prior to that date (such entity, the “Predecessor Company”).
