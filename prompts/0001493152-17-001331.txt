ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
RealBiz Media Group, Inc., including all its subsidiaries, are collectively referred to herein as “RealBiz,” “RBIZ”, “the Company,” “us,” or “we”.
 
Overview
 
We are currently engaged in the business of providing digital media and marketing services for the real estate industry and we intend to enter the international food distribution business. We will focus on international food distribution of nuts, fruits, honey, and meats. We intend to separate the real estate and food distribution business into two segments. We also plan to spin-off the real estate business into a separate company.
Real Estate
 
We have generated revenue from service fees (video creation and production and website hosting (ReachFactor)) and product sales (Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 and Microvideo app). We were formed through the merging of three divisions: (i) our fully licensed real estate division (formerly known as Webdigs); (ii) our TV media contracts (Home Preview Channel /Extraordinary Vacation Homes) division; and (iii) our Real Estate Virtual Tour and Media group (RealBiz 360). The assets of these divisions were used to create a new suite of real estate products and services that create stickiness through the utilization of video, social media, and loyalty programs. At the core of our programs is our proprietary video creation technology which allows for an automated conversion of data (text and pictures of home listings) to a video with voice and music. We provide video search, storage, and marketing capabilities on multiple platform dynamics for web, mobile, and TV. Once a home, personal or community video is created using our proprietary technology, it can be published to social media, email or distributed to multiple real estate websites, broadband or television for consumer viewing.
Products and Services:
 
We currently offer the following products and services:
 
Enterprise Video Production: We service some of the largest and well known franchisor accounts in the North America real estate market in compiling real estate listings into a video format and distributing such video to franchisor’s websites, brokers and agents and lead generation platforms 24/7. Some of these multiyear contracts produced over 10 million video listings from 2012 to 2015 and we anticipate that such contracts will be eclipsing that production in 2017. This core area significantly contributes to our growth not only in this core service but continues to allow us access to national databases and directly agents and brokers to allow us access to upgrades and upsell other core products and services. We currently have the capacity to produce over 15,000 videos per day.


Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 (formerly PowerAgent): Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 is a newly developed comprehensive marketing toolset for the professional real estate agent which utilizes our proprietary video technology to allow any agent to create videos for their listings, edit such videos with music and include an introductory segment and market the videos through multiple sources. This product is powered by an intuitive CRM (customer relationship management) and has been designed to allow agents to extend their marketing reach through social media management, email marketing and web site syndication. In addition, the iOS and Android applications work in conjunction with Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 allowing the agent to take many of the capabilities mobile, right to where the asset is located.
 
The Virtual Tour (VT) and Microvideo App (MVA): These programs were developed and implemented to allow agents to access specific video based product strategies that are designed specifically to increase the search engine optimization (“SEO”) rank and traffic credit to real estate franchise systems and/or their brokers. The MVA is a proprietary video widget marketing application designed to deliver video and integrate SEO strategies, traffic generation, e-mail, lead generation with mobile-friendly viewing. This solution gives those franchises and brokers a much-needed tool to lower their cost of prospect acquisition.


ReachFactor: Our social media and marketing platform under the “ReachFactor” brand name offers a variety of solutions to agents and brokers such as web design and web hosting, digital ad campaigns, blogging, social media management, reputation management and search engine optimization.
 
NestBuilder Website Portal: We provide a consumer real estate portal at www.nestbuilder.com which contains over 1.5 million listings. Unlike other competitors, NestBuilder focuses on building agent’s brands and delivering high-quality leads. Nestbuilder achieves this by offering fully customizable webpages in NestBuilder Agent that will follow homebuyers throughout the home search, ultimately turning www.NestBuilder.com into each agent’s very own national portal. We provide this website free of charge to consumers and agents.
Nestbuilder Agent: This agent-only platform allows agents to claim and customize their own web page to be used as a marketing platform. This platform interacts with the Nestbuilder website allowing agents to claim their listings and then create customized listing pages, as well as being able to pull other Multiple Listing Service (“MLS”) property listings to create specialized marketing messages. Additionally, the agents can view the effectiveness of their marketing efforts through a dashboard that shows multiple statistics including number of views, time spent, origination and lead generation. This platform is provided free of charge and equips each real estate agent with contents and assets that they can use to pursue prospects and generate leads.

Ezflix Mobile Application: The ezflix mobile application is a free mobile/web video editor that pre-integrates with an agent’s listing data, allowing the agent to edit all of their listing’s data, and convert them into video with live video interstitial capabilities, audio recording and music. Ezflix can then share videos to all social media platforms, email, and multiple other real estate portals including, but not limited to, NestBuilder (www.nestbuilder.com) thereby giving agents a way to personalize their listing videos with entertaining local relevant content. This application is available to both web and mobile platforms, and was initially launched for both the Android and iOS versions in January and February 2015, respectively. This platform as it evolves will combine our Virtual Tour (“VT”) and Microvideo App lication (“MVA”) platform into one solution and distribute to multiple partners and resellers including Photographer and Videographer service providers’ network. This product integration was substantially upgraded during 2015 and integrates with our Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 product (formerly PowerAgent) released in January 2016.
Food Products
 
Verus Foods, Inc. (“Verus”) a Nevada corporation, and our wholly owned subsidiary is an international supplier of consumer food products. Verus markets under its own brand primarily to supermarkets, hotels, and other members of the wholesale trade. In 2017, Verus plans to pursue a three-pronged development program through the addition of cold-storage facilities, product line expansion, and new vertical farm-to-market operations. Verus’ initial focus is on frozen foods, particularly meat, poultry, seafood, vegetables, and French fries. Verus has a significant regional presence in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and sub-Saharan Africa (excluding Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”)-restricted nations), with deep roots in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
Growth Strategy
 
Key Elements of our growth strategy during fiscal 2016 include:
 
Leverage our proprietary video technology. While our proprietary video technology has been developed for the real estate industry, we believe this technology can be applied to other industries as well. We believe that the used car sale industry could benefit from our automated and seamless development engine.
 
Design and develop technology for the real estate industry. We will continue working to develop technologies to increase sales and efficiencies for the real estate professional.
 
Fiscal 2016 Developments.
 
Redemption of Convertible Notes. In December 2015, we redeemed our outstanding 7.5% convertible promissory notes issued to Himmil Investments Ltd. (“Himmil”) and canceled Himmel’s warrant to purchase 675,000 shares of the Company’s common stock for $500,000. These convertible notes contained a variable conversion price which, in management’s opinion contributed to downward pressure on our stock price. The funds for the redemption of these notes resulted from the sale of our common stock and warrants which resulted in gross proceeds of $680,000. The balance of the proceeds, or $179,140 (after redemption of the Himmil notes and broker fees) was applied to working capital.
International Food Subsidiary. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we began discussions to add an international food subsidiary under the direction of consumer product industry-veteran Anshu Bhatnagar. Our interest in this business came from the potential to generate future revenue streams at a faster pace than our core business. This plan of action was subsequently implemented, with full integration of this subsidiary scheduled for Fiscal 2017.

Background and Industry Trends
 
We believe that the real estate market is undergoing a dramatic change similar to that previously experienced by traditional stock brokerages. We believe that the most critical aspect driving this change is the advent of the Internet as a tool for searching for and researching real estate, eliminating the time commitments and expense involved with visiting multiple properties in person. Although many buyers use both the Internet and a realtor in their search, according to the National Association of Realtors’ 2014 “Member Profile”, 89% of home buyers use the Internet to search for a home, up from 74% in 2010. This mirrors the 69% who use a realtor for their search. In addition, home sellers can use the Internet to check home valuations, track the housing market and research comparable sales information. Most consumers used the Internet frequently to search for homes (81%), with consumers aged 33 or younger being higher than average (92%) and 59-67 year olds lower than average at 69% Real estate searches are often conducted on mobile devices such as iPhones (47%), iPads (40%) or Androids (24%). One of the most significant trends for our business is that 70% of homebuyers search for and watch video home tours. Also, real estate searches on Google have grown 253% over the past four years.


The increased use of technology throughout the entire process of a residential real estate transaction is an important development in the real estate market. For instance, electronic communication and electronic data storage permits a real estate brokerage to quickly reproduce standard real estate transaction documents, store such documents and other important information about customers and properties, and communicate quickly with other parties involved in real estate transactions (e.g., title companies, insurers, surveyors, inspectors and governmental agencies), all of which permits increased efficiencies in the process of buying and selling a home. The technological changes and developments generally make it possible to affect a greater volume of transactions with less effort and expense.
 
We believe the technological developments in the real estate market and the increased amount of information available to and used by ordinary consumers appear to be circumstances that are similar to those developments that eventually gave rise to the non-traditional stock brokerages which have intruded upon the market dominance of traditional stock brokerages over the past two decades. For example, we note that the non-traditional stock brokerages developed their services and products to compete primarily on the bases of price, consumer effort and technology. Their websites, such as TD Ameritrade or e-Trade, provide not only trading capacity for the average consumer, but also a tremendous amount of information about companies. In this regard, we note that there has recently been a proliferation of various Internet-related real estate businesses that seek to provide either specific and limited services or information relating to residential real estate transactions (e.g., ForSaleByOwner.com, BuyOwner.com, Realtor.com, Trulia.com and Zillow.com). Like the non-traditional stock brokerages, these businesses typically rely on consumer effort, technology, and price as the bases for competition.
 
However, the market models of Zillow/Trulia and Realtor are now in direct conflict with the enterprises that own the listings and that make the actual sales. Zillow’s main revenues are generated by advertising the listing as though another agent owned the listing. Unaware, the consumer thus interacts with the displayed agent thinking they are the one that controls the listing. Then, the display agent contacts the true agent and asks to split the sales commission. As the consumer power of Zillow has grown, they have substantially cut into the profits of the enterprises and agents that actually own the listings. Thus, the battle lines are now drawn between Zillow and groups such as the Realogy member companies (including Century 21, Sotheby’s, Better Homes & Gardens, etc.) and Keller Williams.


We foresee direct and continuous pushback in 2016 by the enterprises against Zillow, in trying to neutralize their marketing power and take ownership back of their listings. As a publicly owned company Zillow can only grow revenues by increasing advertising rates to the agent community which strikes deep into agent discontent with the enterprises and the resulting demand in action. This competitive model is unique to the real estate industry and clearly will not follow the path of the aforementioned financial portals.
 
Website and Mobile Applications
 
RealBiz is utilizing its proprietary technological intellectual property along with its industry contracts to create two separate and very important critical paths for real estate professionals and their organizations to follow. By using its video processing capabilities combined with micro-site and website building techniques RealBiz has created an agent/broker micro-site product that leverages best practices in SEO on the agent/brokers behalf and delivers a web and mobile friendly rich media experience to consumers. This solution provides the broker a significant increase in organic ranking in local searches and increased site traffic, and by doing so, reduces the agent/broker’s dependency on traditional listing aggregators. Secondly, by integrating marketing capabilities into a single powerful platform, we have entered the direct to agent sales model through Nestbuilder Agent 2.0, our proprietary marketing toolset. This strategy lowers risk threshold by distributing revenues throughout 1,200,000 registered agents in the U.S. as well as providing a pathway to develop accelerating revenue stream via a monthly subscription model. While the former video generator intensive model for RealBiz will continue to be our primary revenue generator, we believe that our Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 will become the next generation of marketing for the real estate industry.
Market and Competition
 
The National Association of Realtors has approximately 1.2 million members, of which we estimate roughly half are active and associated with at least one real estate brokerage firm.
 
Presently, Zillow is the largest independent real estate market site, as measured by homes in its database and unique visitors to its website. In 2015 Zillow completed its acquisition of Trulia making it the single most powerful name in the real estate web marketplace. In 2015 a full 29% of web property searches were conducted on the joint platforms. As part of the industry consolidation, NewsCorp recently acquired the third largest real estate portal, Realtor.com. Additionally, there are a variety of other websites which have meaningful market share and listing information. We believe a battle for the consumer mindset is now underway as the real estate enterprises enter into a competitive setting against Zillow/Trulia/Realtor. We also believe RealBiz can benefit from the acrimony as we have positioned ourselves as the friends of the enterprises and offer products and capabilities that will enhance the position of the enterprises by leveraging our technology.

Industry Segments
 
We have operated in one primary operating segment, real estate, mainly through web-assisted services. We intend to begin operations in a new segment for our planned food products business.
Seasonality of Business
 
The residential real estate market has traditionally experienced seasonality, with a peak in the spring and summer seasons and a decrease in activity during the fall and winter seasons. Revenues in each quarter can be significantly affected by activity during the prior quarter, given the time lag between contract execution and closing. A typical real estate transaction has a 30-day lag between contract signing and closing of the transaction.
 
Verus Food is expected to have only modest seasonality due to the product mix, which will include many staples such as nuts, fruits, honey, and meats. We expect our initial growth rates to mask any seasonality during our first year of operation which is anticipated to commence in 2017. In the Middle East markets, we expect to see a spike in sales during the month of Ramadan.


Other GOVERNMENT Regulation
 
We are subject to governmental regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities with respect to our operations. We operate several Internet websites that we use to distribute information and provide our services and content. Internet services are now subject to regulation in the United States relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under the age of 13, including the federal Child Online Protection Act (“COPA”) and the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (“CAN-SPAM”). In addition, most states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations. Additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services, covering such issues as user privacy, child safety, data security, advertising, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services. In addition, to the extent we offer products and services to online consumers outside the United States, the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions, including, without limitation, consumer protection, privacy, advertising, data retention, intellectual property, and content limitations, may impose additional compliance obligations on us.
 
Verus is subject to U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and other government regulations in the countries in which we operate.

Corporate Structure and Information
 
Our principal offices are located at 9711 Washingtonian Blvd #550, Gaithersburg, MD, 20850, and our telephone number at that office is (908) 758-3787. Our website address is www.realbizmedia.com. The information contained on our website or that can be accessed through our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
On July 12, 2012, we were incorporated in the state of Delaware under the name Webdigs, Inc. On October 9, 2012, we completed a share exchange (the “Exchange Transaction”) with Monaker Group, Inc. (formerly known as Next 1 Interactive, Inc.), a Nevada corporation (“Monaker”), and we received all of the outstanding equity in Attaché Travel International, Inc., a Florida corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Monaker (“Attaché”) in consideration of our issuance to Monaker of 93 million shares of our newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Attaché owned approximately 80% of a corporation named RealBiz Holdings Inc. which is the parent corporation of RealBiz 360, Inc. (“RealBiz”). As a condition to the closing of the Exchange Transaction, on October 3, 2012, we changed our name from “Webdigs, Inc.” to “RealBiz Media Group, Inc.”, by engaging in a short-form parent-subsidiary merger in the State of Delaware.
 
In August 2015, we completed the restructuring of our management, financial reporting and operations from our former parent company, Monaker Group, Inc. The primary purpose of the restructuring was to eliminate unnecessary development expenses and unlock revenue opportunities by creating a unified technology platform.
 
On August 6, 2015, we issued an aggregate 35,000 shares of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock to (i) Keith White, a member of the Company’s Board of Director at the time and (ii) a company controlled by the Company’s then Chairman, Don Monaco. Mr. Monaco received 20,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock in consideration of cancellation of $100,000 in indebtedness owed to him by the Company’s former parent company, Monaker. The debt was convertible into 2 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Mr. White received 15,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock in exchange for 15,000 shares the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock held by Mr. White.
 
Each share of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 100 shares of the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, the 35,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible into an aggregate of 3,500,000 shares of common stock. Although, the holders of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock vote together with holders of our common stock as a single class, each holder of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to the number of votes equal to 100 votes for each share of our common stock into which the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock could be converted. Accordingly, the 35,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to 350,000,000 votes.
 
On November 16, 2016, the Company, with the approval of a majority of the shareholders eligible to vote, approved an amendment of the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) to effect a 1 for 200 reverse split of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The reverse split has not been declared effective by FINRA as of the filing date of this Annual Report.
