Our business consists principally of promoting racing events at these major motorsports entertainment facilities, which, in total, currently have approximately 761,000 grandstand seats and 560 suites. We earn revenues and generate substantial cash flows primarily from admissions, television media rights fees, promotion and sponsorship fees, hospitality rentals (including luxury suites, chalets and the hospitality portion of club seating), advertising revenues, royalties from licenses of our trademarks, parking and camping, and track rentals. We own Americrown Service Corporation (“Americrown”), which provides catering, concessions and services at certain of our motorsports entertainment facilities. We own and operate the Motor Racing Network, Inc. ("MRN") radio network, also doing business under the name “MRN Radio”, the nation’s largest independent motorsports radio network in terms of event programming. We have an equity investment in a Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway that has generated substantial equity earnings and cash distributions to us since its opening in fiscal year 2012. We are developing a retail, dining and entertainment destination, ONE DAYTONA, across from Daytona International Speedway, which will create synergy with the Speedway, enhance customer and partner experiences, monetize real estate on International Speedway Blvd. and leverage our real estate on a year-round basis.
INCORPORATION
We were incorporated in 1953 under the laws of the State of Florida under the name “Bill France Racing, Inc.” and changed our name to “Daytona International Speedway Corporation” in 1957.

OPERATIONS
The general nature of our business is a motorsports themed amusement enterprise, furnishing amusement to the public in the form of motorsports themed entertainment. Our motorsports themed event operations consist principally of racing events at our major motorsports entertainment facilities, which include providing catering and food and beverage concessions at our motorsports entertainment facilities that host NASCAR Cup Series events except for catering and food and beverage concessions at Chicagoland and Route 66. Our other operations include MRN; our 50.0 percent equity investment in the joint venture Kansas Entertainment, LLC ("Kansas Entertainment"), which operates the Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway; and certain other activities including retail, dining and entertainment operations at ONE DAYTONA. We derived approximately 89.3 percent of our 2017 revenues from NASCAR-sanctioned racing events at our wholly owned motorsports entertainment facilities. In addition to events sanctioned by NASCAR, in fiscal 2017, we promoted other stock car, sports car, open wheel, motorcycle and go-kart racing events.
Food, Beverage and Merchandise Operations
We conduct, either through operations of the particular facility or through our wholly owned subsidiary, Americrown, food and beverage concession operations and catering services, both in suites and chalets, for customers at each of our motorsports entertainment facilities with the exception of food and beverage concessions and catering services at Chicagoland, Route 66 and ISM Raceway. In January 2015, the Company entered into a 10-year agreement with Fanatics Retail Group Concessions, Inc. ("Fanatics") for Fanatics to have exclusive retail merchandise rights for its track trademarks and certain other intellectual property at all ISC tracks.
Motor Racing Network, Inc.
Our wholly owned subsidiary, MRN, also does business under the name “MRN Radio”. While not a radio station, MRN creates motorsports-related programming content carried on radio stations around the country as well as on a national satellite radio service, Sirius XMRadio. MRN produces and syndicates to radio stations live coverage of the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck series races and certain other races conducted at our motorsports entertainment facilities, as well as some races conducted at motorsports entertainment facilities we do not own. Sirius XM Radio also compensates MRN for the contemporaneous re-airing of race broadcasts and certain other production services. MRN produces and provides unique content to its website, http://www.motorracingnetwork.com/, and derives revenue from the sale of advertising on such website. Each motorsports entertainment facility has the ability to separately contract for the rights to radio broadcasts of NASCAR and certain other events held at its location. In addition, MRN provides production services for the trackside large screen video display units ("ISM Vision") at NASCAR Cup Series event weekends that take place at our motorsports facilities, as well as at Dover International Speedway and Pocono Raceway. MRN also produces and syndicates daily and weekly NASCAR racing-themed programs. MRN derives revenue from the sale of national advertising contained in its syndicated programming, the sale of advertising and audio and video production services for ISM Vision, as well as from rights fees paid by radio stations that broadcast the programming. 
ONE DAYTONA
We have pursued development of ONE DAYTONA, a premier mixed use, dining, retail and entertainment destination across from the Daytona International Speedway, which will create synergy with the Speedway, enhance customer and partner experiences, monetize real estate on International Speedway Blvd and leverage our real estate on a year-round basis (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - ONE DAYTONA").
EQUITY INVESTMENTS
Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway
We have a 50/50 partnership with Penn Hollywood Kansas Inc. (“Penn”), a subsidiary of Penn National Gaming Inc., which operates a Hollywood-themed and branded destination entertainment facility, overlooking turn two at Kansas. Penn is the managing member of Kansas Entertainment and is responsible for the operation of the casino (see "Equity and Other Investments"). 
Fairfield Inn Hotel at ONE DAYTONA
We have a 33.25 percent equity interest in a partnership with Daytona Hospitality Group II, LLC ("DHGII"), a subsidiary of Prime-Shaner Groups, to construct and operate a Fairfield Inn hotel. DHGII is the managing member of the Fairfield and is responsible for the development and operations of the hotel (see "Equity and Other Investments").

The Autograph Hotel at ONE DAYTONA
We have a 34.0 percent equity interest in a partnership with Daytona Hospitality Group, LLC ("DHG"), a subsidiary of Prime-Shaner Groups, to construct and operate a Autograph hotel. DHG is the managing member of the Fairfield and is responsible for the development and operations of the hotel (see "Equity and Other Investments").
We have entered into an additional joint venture, which is structured similarly to the Fairfield Inn joint venture. This joint venture project includes a residential component of the ONE DAYTONA project (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - ONE DAYTONA").
Other Activities
From time to time, we use our motorsports entertainment facilities for testing for teams, driving schools, riding experiences, car shows, auto fairs, concerts, music festivals and settings for television commercials, print advertisements and motion pictures, which may be promoted by us or a third party. 
Competition
We are among the largest owners of major motorsports themed entertainment facilities based on revenues, number of facilities owned and/or operated, number of motorsports themed events promoted and market capitalization. Racing events compete with other professional sports such as football, basketball, hockey and baseball, as well as other recreational events and activities. Our events also compete with other racing events sanctioned by various racing bodies such as NASCAR, the American Sportbike Racing Association — Championship Cup Series, United States Auto Club (“USAC”), Sports Car Club of America (“SCCA”), IMSA, IndyCar Series, ARCA and others, many of which are often held on the same dates at separate motorsports entertainment facilities. We believe that the type and caliber of promoted racing events, facility location, sight lines, pricing, variety of motorsports themed amusement options and level of customer conveniences and amenities are the principal factors that distinguish competing motorsports entertainment facilities.
Employees
As of November 30, 2017 we had over 820 full-time employees. We also engage a significant number of temporary personnel to assist during periods of peak attendance at our events, some of whom are volunteers. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that we enjoy a good relationship with our employees.
