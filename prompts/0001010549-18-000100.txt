Item 1.                         Business
Company Overview
 
Water Now, Inc. was incorporated in Texas on February 10, 2016 to develop and commercialize a patent-pending, gas/diesel powered, portable device that processes and purifies contaminated water. Our business strategy was conceived as a result of the growing global water crisis. Today, many countries and regions are experiencing acute water shortages and we believe our technology and products are capable of generating safe drinking water from many available water sources.
 
Our product lines are designed to consist of portable units capable of providing a cost-effective, safe and efficient method of water purification. Our products require no pre- or post-treatment of the source water, no filters, no membranes and no chemicals. The quality of water purified by products has been tested to meet or exceed the World Health Organization’s (“WHO”) drinking water standards.
 
Product Line 
 
Three models in our product line have been developed for commercialization: the Aqua 125 unit, the Aqua 1000 unit, and an upgraded Aqua 1000 unit designed for disaster relief, military and agricultural applications. The Aqua 125 model is capable of purifying fresh water that is contaminated primarily with partially dissolved solid material, microorganisms and other pathogens, which can be dangerous to humans. The Aqua 125 model has the capacity to purify up to 120 gallons of water per day. The Aqua 1000 model adds the ability to desalinate salt water, with a capacity of up to 800 gallons per day. The disaster relief configuration, which consists of an upgraded Aqua 1000 unit complemented with a reservoir mounted on a trailer, is expected to be capable of purifying up to 800 gallons of water per day.

All models are currently available for purchase.
 
Manufacturing and Distribution
 
Strategy
 
Our distribution strategy is to distribute our products through direct sales and distributors. We are focusing on selling our products to governmental and non-governmental organizations both inside and outside the U.S. For the foreseeable future, we do not anticipate focusing on retail distribution.
Sunmark Ltd.
 
We have entered into a Sales Agreement with Sun Mark (Gulf) JLT, an affiliate of UK-based Sun Mark Ltd. This Sales Agreement provides that we will sell to Sun Mark a total of 10,000 units of the Aqua 125 model, subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement. The Company and Sun Mark have waived the delivery schedule in the Sales Agreement. To date, the Company has delivered 50 Aqua 125 units to Sun Mark at a purchase price of $2,995 per unit.
Materials and Suppliers
 
We do not expect to depend on any single source of materials for the production of our water purification products. As currently designed, the components of our Aqua units are available from various sources. We believe that all components have adequate replacements from other suppliers.
 
We entered into a General Assembly Agreement with Source One International Co. Ltd. (“Source One”). Pursuant to the General Assembly Agreement, Source One agrees to assemble and deliver to us the protective metal cage component of our units. Source One has agreed to warrant products sold pursuant to the agreement for one year from the date of shipment.
 
Currently, we purchase Ducar generators from Chongqing Dajiang Power Equipment Company, Ltd (“CDP”); however, we do not have a supplier agreement with CDP.
 
Customers
 
In addition to Sun Mark, the Company has sold a small number of units to multiple customers in South America. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had back-log orders of approximately $65,000. All of which are expected to be filled in fiscal year 2018.
Warranty 
 
We have entered into an Administration Agreement with Datacom Warranty Corp., a third-party warranty administrator, to administer warranty claims. We expect that all significant components of our products will have warranties from the respective supplier. We have retained Datacom to administer warranty claims with the responsible component manufacturer. Our cost to have Datacom administer warranty claims on our behalf under the Administration Agreement is $30.00 per unit shipped by us.

Competition
 
There are numerous competitors in the water purification industry. We believe that the design of our water purification products have advantages over other water purification solutions that are currently available. Our products are designed not to require pre- or post-treatment of the source water, filters, membranes or chemicals. We believe that our water purification units will compete on the basis of a combination of the foregoing factors, as well as price. We expect that competition for water purification solutions will remain highly competitive.
Governmental Approvals and Regulations
 
We do not anticipate that we will need to obtain material governmental approvals for the manufacturing and distribution of our water purification products, other than customary permits and licenses generally applicable to businesses operating in the geographic areas in which we operate. We do not anticipate that obtaining any such permit or license will impact or hinder our operations in any material respect. We also expect to be subject to regulations applicable to businesses operating in the areas in which we operate. We do not anticipate that any of such regulations will have a material effect on our business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we can give no assurance regarding the impact that governmental regulations might have on our operations. We do not anticipate that we will be required to incur significant costs and expenses in order to comply with environmental laws, although certain components incorporated into our products are expected to require certifications that they satisfy applicable environmental regulatory requirements. The cost of obtaining such certifications are expected to be borne by our suppliers.
Intellectual Property
 
We have filed a patent application (application number 62/472,246) for the design of our water purification technology with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Current water purification products typically require disposable filters and membranes coupled with a heating element driven through a resistive coil that can fail, especially if coming in contact with the fluids involved. Our design seeks to mitigate these problems by utilizing a water pump fed rotational centrifugal system, where solid contaminants are held to the interior cylindrical walls of the centrifuge, resulting in water containing fewer contaminants.
Research and Development; Employees
 
From our formation through December 31, 2017, we incurred an aggregate of approximately $1,695,000 on research and development (“R&D”) activities. As of December 31, 2017, we had nine employees, all of whom were employed on a full-time basis.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or “JOBS Act.” An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies, and we have elected to comply with these reduced reporting and other burdens. These provisions include:

• | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements and an exemption from various shareholder voting requirements with respect to executive compensation arrangements. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We could remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, (iii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. The foregoing amounts are subject to adjustment for inflation.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act and Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with the revised accounting standards. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
 
Merger of VCAB One Corporation into Water Now, Inc.
 
On September 27, 2016, we consummated a transaction whereby VCAB One Corporation, a Texas corporation (“VCAB”), merged with and into us. At the time of the merger VCAB was subject to a bankruptcy proceeding and had minimal assets, no equity owners and no liabilities, except for approximately 1,500 holders of Class 5 Allowed General Unsecured Claims and a holder of allowed administrative expenses (collectively, “Claim Holders”). Pursuant to the terms of the merger, and in accordance with the bankruptcy plan, we issued an aggregate of 703,808 shares of our common stock (the “Plan Shares”) to the Claim Holders whose claims had been approved as of the time of issuance as full settlement and satisfaction of their respective claims. As provided in the confirmed bankruptcy plan, the Plan Shares were issued pursuant to Section 1145 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. An additional 196,192 Plan Shares are held in reserve in the Company’s treasury for issuance to Claim Holders whose claims have yet to be either approved or denied by the court. The treasury shares will be issued once a Claim Holder’s claim has been approved or disapproved. If disapproved the shares will be distributed to approved Claim Holders on a pro rata basis. As a result of the merger, the separate corporate existence of VCAB was terminated. We entered into the merger in order to increase our shareholder base in order to, among other things, assist us in satisfying the listing standards of a national securities exchange.
