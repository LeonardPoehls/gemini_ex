Item 1. Business
General
MSB Financial Corp. (the "Company") is a Maryland-chartered corporation organized in 2014 to be the successor to MSB Financial Corp., a federal corporation ("Old MSB") upon completion of the second-step conversion of Millington Bank (the "Bank") from the two-tier mutual holding company structure to the stock holding company structure. MSB Financial, MHC (the "MHC") was the former mutual holding company for Old MSB prior to completion of the second-step conversion.  In conjunction with the second-step conversion, each of the MHC and Old MSB ceased to exist.  The second-step conversion was completed on July 16, 2015 at which time the Company sold 3,766,592 shares of its common stock (including 150,663 shares purchased by the Bank's employee stock ownership plan) at $10.00 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $37.7 million. Expenses related to the stock offering totaled $1.5 million and were netted against proceeds. As part of the second-step conversion, each of the outstanding shares of common stock of Old MSB held by persons other than the MHC were converted into 1.1397 shares of Company common stock with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares.  As a result, a total of 2,187,242 shares were issued in exchange for Old MSB shares in the second-step conversion.
The Company's principal business is the ownership and operation of the Bank. The Bank is a New Jersey-chartered stock savings bank and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The primary business of the Bank is attracting retail deposits from the general public and using those deposits together with funds generated from operations, principal repayments on securities and loans and borrowed funds, for its lending and investing activities. The Bank's loan portfolio primarily consists of one-to-four family and home equity residential loans, commercial loans, and construction loans. It also invests in U.S. government obligations and mortgage-backed securities. The Bank is regulated by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") regulates the Company as a bank holding company.
In accordance with the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Company is the successor issuer to Old MSB and all financial data included herein up through the completion of the second-step conversion is that of Old MSB.
Throughout this document, references to "we," "us," or "our" refer to the Bank or Company, or both, as the context indicates.
Change in Fiscal Year End
Effective November 17, 2014, the Company changed its fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31.
Competition
We operate in a market area with a high concentration of banking and other financial institutions, and we face substantial competition in attracting deposits and in originating loans. A number of our competitors are significantly larger institutions with greater financial and managerial resources and lending limits. Our ability to compete successfully is a significant factor affecting our growth potential and profitability.
1

Our competition for deposits and loans historically has come from other insured financial institutions such as local and regional commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions located in our primary market area. We also compete with mortgage banking and finance companies for real estate loans and with commercial banks and savings institutions for consumer loans, and we face competition for funds from investment products such as mutual funds, short-term money funds and corporate and government securities. There are large competitors operating throughout our total market area, and we also face strong competition from other community-based financial institutions.
Lending Activities
We have traditionally focused on the origination of one- to four-family loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, which together comprise a sizeable portion of the total loan portfolio. During the past two years, we have significantly grown our commercial real estate portfolio, which includes multi-family dwellings/apartment buildings, service/retail and mixed-use properties, churches and non-profit properties, medical and dental facilities and other commercial real estate. Additionally, we originate residential and commercial construction loans and commercial and industrial loans. Our consumer loans are comprised of automobile loans, personal loans, account loans and overdraft lines of credit.
Loan Portfolio Composition.   The following tables analyze the composition of the Company's loan portfolio by loan category at the dates indicated.  Except as set forth below, there were no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans.

One- to Four-Family Real Estate Mortgages. Historically, the primary focus of our lending activity was the origination of one- to four-family first mortgage loans.  We continue to offer fixed rate, conventional mortgage loans with terms from 5 to 30 years.
We also originate adjustable rate mortgages, or ARMs, with up to 30 year terms at rates based upon the U.S. Treasury One Year Constant Maturity as an index. Our ARMs currently reset on an annual basis, beginning with the first year, and have a 200 basis point annual increase cap and a 600 basis point lifetime adjustment cap.  We do not originate "teaser" rate or negative amortization loans.
We are also offering a loan program whereby we offer an initial rate for a fixed period of time, normally 5 to 10 years, and thereafter there is one preset interest rate adjustment based on competitive rates.
Substantially all residential mortgages include "due on sale" clauses, which are provisions giving us the right to declare a loan immediately payable if the borrower sells or otherwise transfers an interest in the property to a third party. Property appraisals on real estate securing one-to four-family residential loans are made by state certified or licensed independent appraisers and are performed in accordance with applicable regulations and policies. We require title insurance policies on all first lien one-to four-family residential loans and all home equity loans over $250,000.  Homeowners, liability, fire and, if applicable, flood insurance policies are also required.
We provide financing on residential investment properties with 5 to 30 year fixed duration mortgages. Our investment property lending product is available to individuals or proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability corporations, and corporations with personal guarantees. All investment property is underwritten on its ability substantially to carry itself, unless the property is a twoâ€‘family residence with the mortgagor living in one of the units. Preference is given to those loans where rental income covers all operating expenditures, including but not limited to principal and interest, real estate taxes, hazard insurance, utilities, maintenance, and reserve. The cash coverage ratio to cover operating expenses must be at least 1.25 times.  Any negative cash flow will be included in the borrower's total debt ratio.  At December 31, 2017, investment property loans secured by one- to four-family homes totaled $42.6 million.
We generally originate one-to four-family first mortgage loans for primary residences and investment properties with loan-to-value ratios ranging from 65% to 80% depending on the collateral value.
Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Mortgages. Our commercial real estate lending includes multi-family dwellings/apartment buildings, service/retail and mixed-use properties, churches and non-profit properties, medical and dental facilities and other commercial real estate. Our commercial real estate mortgage loans are typically a 5 to 10 year balloon mortgage.  Multi-family and commercial real estate loans can be amortized over 30 years with periodic rate resets or 15 year fixed duration mortgages. This type of lending is made available to proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability companies and corporations with personal guarantees and/or carve out guarantees. All commercial property is underwritten on its ability substantially to provide satisfactory cash flows.  A cash flow and lease analysis is performed for each property. Preference is given to those loans where rental income covers all operating expenditures, including but not limited to principal and interest, real estate tax, hazard insurance, utilities, maintenance, and reserves. The cash coverage ratio to cover operating expenses must be at least 1.20 times for multi-family and 1.25 times for all other commercial loans.  Any negative cash flow will be included in the limit on the borrower's total debt ratio. Cash from other assets of the borrower, who may own multiple properties and generate a surplus, can be made available 
3

to cover debtâ€‘service shortages of the financed property. Maximum loan-to-value ratios on commercial real estate loans range from 65% to 80%.
The management skills of the borrower are judged on the basis of his/her professional experience and must be documented to meet the Company's satisfaction in relation to the desired project. The assets of the borrower must indicate his/her ability to support the proposed investment, both in terms of liquidity and net worth, and tangible history of the borrower's capability and experience must be evident.
Unlike single-family residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income, and which are secured by real property the value of which tends to be more easily ascertainable, multi-family and commercial real estate loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's business or rental income. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial real estate and multi-family loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself, the tenants and the general economic environment. Commercial real estate and multi-family loans, therefore, have greater credit risk than one-to four-family residential mortgages or consumer loans. In addition, commercial real estate and multi-family loans generally result in larger balances to single borrowers, or related groups of borrowers and also generally require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts.
Construction Loans. We originate construction loans for an owner-occupied residence or to a builder with a valid contract of sale. We also provide financing for speculative residential or commercial construction and development with individual consideration given to builders based on their past performance, workmanship, and financial worth. Our construction lending includes loans for construction or major renovations or improvements of owner-occupied residences.  The portfolio consists primarily of properties held by real estate developers.
Construction loans are mortgages up to 24 months in duration. Funds are disbursed periodically upon inspections made by our inspectors on the percentage of work completed, as per the approved budget. Funds disbursed may not exceed 60% of the loan-to-value of land and 80% of the loan-to-value of improvements any time during construction. The majority of our construction loans are variable rate loans with rates tied to the prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a premium. The Bank also has established a floor rate on all transactions.  A minimum of interest-only payments on disbursed funds must be made on a monthly basis.
Construction lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than residential mortgage lending. If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, we may be compelled to advance additional funds to complete the construction with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, there is no assurance that we will be able to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time.
Consumer Loans. Our consumer lending products consist of new and used automobile loans, secured and unsecured personal loans, account loans and overdraft lines of credit. The maximum term for a loan on a new or used automobile is six years and four years, respectively. We will lend up to 80% of the retail value or dealer invoice on a car loan. We offer a reduction on the interest rate for car loans if payments are automatically deducted from a Millington Bank checking or statement savings account.
Our personal loans have terms of up to four years with a minimum and maximum balance of $1,000 and $5,000, respectively. A reduction to the interest rate is offered for loans with automatic debit repayment from a Millington Bank checking or statement savings account. Our account loans permit a depositor to borrow up to 90% of his or her funds on deposit with us in certificate of deposit accounts. The interest rate is the current rate paid to the depositor, plus a premium. A minimum payment of interest only is required. We also offer an overdraft line of credit with a minimum of $500 and up to a maximum of $5,000 and an interest rate tied to the prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a premium.
Consumer lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than residential mortgage lending. Consumer loan repayment is dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability and can be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, personal bankruptcy and other factors. The application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on consumer loans in the event of a default. Account loans are fully secured.
Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. We offer fixed rate home equity loans and variable rate home equity lines of credit with a minimum credit limit of $5,000. Collateral valuation is established through a variety of methods, including an on-line appraisal valuation estimator, drive-by appraisals, recent assessed tax value, purchase price or consideration value as evidenced 
4

by a deed or property search report or a report of comparable real estate properties from a licensed realtor. Loan requests over $50,000, however, require a drive-by appraisal and amounts over $100,000 require full appraisals.  Loan requests over $500,000 require Loan Committee approval. Any policy exception requires approval from the Board of Directors. The loan-to-value limit on home equity lending varies depending on the collateral value and ranges from 65% up to 80%. The variable rate on home equity lines of credit is adjusted monthly and is currently set at prime for owner occupied properties and prime plus a premium for investment properties. The fixed rate loans on investment property are also higher than fixed rate owner occupied home equity loans. We generally provide home equity financing only for a first or second lien position.
Our fixed rate home equity loans have terms of 5 to 30 years. All new variable rate home equity lines of credit have terms of 10 years interest only draw period and a 15 year repayment period with a loan to value ranging from 65% to 80%.  Our existing portfolio of home equity lines is also comprised of interest only home equity lines of credit based on a 10 year draw period and 15 year repayment period consisting of principal and interest repayments.  The loan-to-value limit on interest only home equity financing is 80% on owner-occupied property and 70% on investment property.  We also offer bridge loans with a variable rate and a 70% loan-to-value limit on owner-occupied property and 60% on investment property.
Commercial and Industrial Loans. We offer revolving lines of credit to businesses to finance shortâ€‘term working capital needs like accounts receivable and inventory. These lines of credit may be unsecured or secured by liquid assets, accounts receivable and inventory or real estate. We generally provide such financing for no more than a 3 year term and with a variable rate. We also offer unsecured lines of credit to high net worth borrowers for short term working capital and/or business or investment purposes. These lines have a maximum term of two years with a variable interest rate.
We also originate commercial term loans to fund longerâ€‘term borrowing needs such as purchasing equipment, property improvements or other fixed asset needs. These loans are secured by new and used machinery, equipment, fixtures, furniture or other long-term fixed assets and have terms of 1 to 15 years. We originate commercial term loans for other general long-term business purposes, and these loans are secured by real estate. Principal and interest on commercial term loans is payable monthly.
The normal minimum amount for our commercial term loans and lines of credit is $5,000. The maximum amount is based on the loan to value limits set in our policy.  We typically do not provide working capital loans to businesses outside our normal market area or to new businesses where repayment is dependent solely on future profitable operation of the business. We avoid originating loans for which the primary source of repayment could be liquidation of the collateral securing the loan in light of poor repayment prospects. We typically require personal and/or carve out guarantees on all commercial loans, regardless of other collateral securing the loan.
The loan-to-value limits on commercial loans vary according to the collateral. Loans secured by real estate may be originated for up to an 80% loan-to-value ratio. Other limits are typically: Savings accounts-90% of the deposit amount; new equipment-75% of purchase price; and used equipment-the lesser of 75% of the purchase price or current market value.
Loans to One Borrower. The Bank's regulatory limit on total loans to any borrower or attributed to any one borrower is 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017, our loans to one borrower legal limit was approximately $9.6 million.
The Bank's lending policies require that any transaction between $500,000 and the Bank's legal lending limit must be approved by the Senior Loan Committee.  Any exceptions to policy requires prior Board approval.
At December 31, 2017, the Bank's largest lending relationship with a single borrower was an $9.0 million commercial loan to a non-depository financial institution.
Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Solicitation and Processing. Our customary sources of loan applications include repeat customers, referrals from realtors and other professionals, "walk-in" customers and business opportunities generated by our commercial lenders. Our residential loan originations are driven by the Bank's reputation, as opposed to being advertising driven.
We recently began to sell loans with servicing released into the secondary mortgage market. We sold four residential mortgage loans through December 31, 2017 and did not sell any loans for the preceding four year period.  It is our policy to retain the loans we originate in our portfolio. We have not uniformly originated our real estate mortgage loans to meet the documentation standards to sell loans in the secondary mortgage market. We may do so, however, in the future if we find it desirable in connection with interest rate risk management to sell longer term fixed rate mortgages into the secondary mortgage market.
5

We purchased $25.0 million in whole commercial real estate loans for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, we purchased $55.5 million in participation interests in loans originated by other banks during 2017. The Company will continue to actively utilize purchases and participations to grow the portfolio.
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Lending policies and loan approval limits are approved and adopted by the Board of Directors. Lending authority is vested primarily in the Senior Loan Committee comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Lending Officer and the Chief Credit Officer who will review and approve loans over $500,000 and up to the Bank's legal lending limit.  Each of the above individuals also has individual lending authority of up to $500,000.  Certain other Bank employees also have limited lending authority. Prior Board approval is required for all loan products with any exceptions to loan policy, regardless of amount.
Asset Quality
Loan Delinquencies and Collection Procedures. The Company's procedures for delinquent loans are as follows:

15 days delinquent: | late charge added, first delinquent notice mailed 
30 days delinquent: | second delinquent notice mailed 
45 days delinquent: | additional late charge, third delinquent notice mailed, telephone contact made
60 days delinquent: | telephone contact made, separate letter mailed 
90 days delinquent: | decision made to refer to attorney to send demand letter 
120 days delinquent: | attorney to file complaint to begin legal action 

When a loan is 90 days delinquent, the Senior Vice President and Chief Credit Officer or the President may determine to refer it to an attorney to send a demand letter.  After 120 days, the attorney is able to start the foreclosure proceedings by filing a complaint with the court.  All reasonable attempts are made to collect from borrowers prior to referral to an attorney for collection. In certain instances, we may modify the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize his or her financial affairs, and we attempt to work with the borrower to establish a repayment schedule to cure the delinquency.
As to mortgage loans, if a foreclosure action is taken and the loan is not reinstated, paid in full or refinanced, the property is sold at judicial sale at which we may be the buyer if there are no adequate offers to satisfy the debt. Any property acquired as the result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until it is sold or otherwise disposed of. When real estate owned is acquired, it is recorded at its fair value less estimated selling costs. The initial write-down of the property is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Adjustments to the carrying value of the property that result from subsequent declines in value are charged to operations in the period in which the declines occur. At December 31, 2017, we had no other real estate owned.
As to commercial loans, the Company requests updated financial statements when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent. As to account loans, the outstanding balance is collected from the related account along with accrued interest when the loan is 180 days delinquent.
Loans are reviewed on a regular basis, and all delinquencies of 60 days or more are reported to the Board of Directors. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they are more than 90 days delinquent, except for such loans which are "well secured" and "in the process of collection."  In addition a loan may be placed on nonaccrual status at any time if, in the opinion of management, the collection of the loan in full is doubtful. An asset is "well secured" if it is secured (1) by collateral in the form of liens on or pledges of real or personal property, including securities, that have a realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt (including accrued interest) in full, or (2) by the guarantee of a financially responsible party.  An asset is "in process of collection" if collection of the asset is proceeding in due course either (1) through legal action, including judgment enforcement procedures, or (2) in appropriate circumstances, through collection efforts not involving legal action which are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or its restoration to a current status in the near future.
When loans with interest accrued and unpaid are placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income. Subsequent payments are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on the assessment of the ultimate collectability of the loan. At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $4.0 million of loans that were held on a nonaccrual basis, all of which were classified as impaired with $33,000 subject to specific loss allowances totaling $28,000.

_______________

(1) | Includes $1.7 million, $2.2 million, $4.1 million, $4.6 million, and $3.2 million, in troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") at December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014 and June 30 2014, respectively.


(2) | Total non-performing assets consist of total non-performing loans and other real estate owned of $-, $-, $-, $1.3 million, and $409,000 at December 31, 2017, 2016 ,2015 and 2014 and June 30, 2014.

At December 31, 2017, there were no loans not disclosed in the table above where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such loans in the future.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, gross interest income of $174,000 would have been recorded on loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and $102,000 would have been recorded on troubled debt restructurings if those loans had been current in accordance with their original terms. $497,000 of interest collected on such loans was included in interest income during the period.
Classified Assets. The Company in compliance with the Uniform Credit Classification and Account Management Policy adopted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Company has an internal loan review program, whereby non-performing loans are classified as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss. It is our policy to review the commercial real estate, construction, and commercial loan portfolios, in accordance with regulatory classification procedures, on at least a quarterly basis. When a loan is classified as substandard or doubtful, management is required to evaluate the loan for impairment. When management classifies a portion of a loan as loss, a reserve equal to 100% of the loss amount is required to be established or the loan is to be charged-off, if a conforming loss event has occurred.
An asset that does not currently expose the Company to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification, but which possesses credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention is classified as "special mention."
7

An asset classified as "substandard" is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified have wellâ€‘defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
An asset classified as "doubtful" has all the weaknesses inherent in a "substandard" asset with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of a loss on a doubtful asset is high.
That portion of an asset classified as "loss" is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as an asset, without chargeâ€‘off, is not warranted. This classification does not necessarily mean that an asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value; but rather, it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off a basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future.
Management's classification of assets is reviewed by the Board on a regular basis and by the regulatory agencies as part of their examination process.
The following table discloses the Company's classification of loans as of December 31, 2017.

 | At December 31, 2017 
 | (In thousands) 
Special Mention | $ | 1,597
Substandard | 1,261 | 
Doubtful | â€” | 
Loss | â€” | 
Total | $ | 2,858

At December 31, 2017, 3 out of the 10 loans adversely classified, totaling $414,000, are included as non-performing loans in the non-performing assets table.
Management further monitors the performance and credit quality of the retail portfolio by analyzing the age of the portfolio as determined by the length of time a recorded payment is past due. These credit quality indicators are assessed in the aggregate in these relatively homogeneous portfolios. Loans greater than 90 days past due are generally considered nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual status. 
Allowance for Credit Losses. The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments.  The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the Statement of Financial Condition date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The reserve for unfunded credit commitments represents management's estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. No additional provisions are recorded in the event the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses exceeds the calculated reserve for unfunded credit commitments. The allowance for credit losses is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. All, or part, of the principal balance of loans receivable that are deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance when management determines that the repayment of that amount is highly unlikely.    Any subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance.  Non-residential consumer loans are generally charged off no later than 120 days past due on a contractual basis, earlier in the event of bankruptcy, or if there is an amount deemed uncollectible.  
Management, in determining the allowance for loan losses, considers the Company's past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The allowance consists of specific, general and unallocated components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan) is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class.  These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these classes of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors.  Each factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on management's best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation.  The unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.
The allowance calculation methodology includes segregation of the total loan portfolio into segments. The Company's loans receivable portfolio is comprised of the following segments: residential mortgage, commercial real estate, construction, consumer and commercial and 
8

industrial. Some segments of the Company's loan receivable portfolio are further disaggregated into classes which allows management to better monitor risk and performance.
The residential mortgage loan segment is disaggregated into two classes: one-to four-family loans, which are primarily first liens, and home equity loans, which consist of first and second liens.  The commercial real estate loan segment consists of both owner and non-owner occupied loans and is further disaggregated into owner-occupied loans and investor properties, which have medium risk due to historical activity on these type loans.  The construction loan segment is further disaggregated into two classes: one-to four-family owner occupied, which includes land loans, whereby the owner is known and there is less risk, and other, whereby the property is generally under development and tends to have more risk than the one-to four-family owner occupied loans.  The commercial and industrial loan segment consists of loans made for the purpose of financing the activities of commercial customers. The commercial and industrial loans consist of a mix of loans secured by real estate and unsecured lines of credit some of which are for high net worth individuals. The consumer loan segment consists primarily of installment loans and overdraft lines of credit connected with customer deposit accounts.  
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.
Loans whose terms are modified are classified as TDRs if the Company grants such borrowers concessions and it is deemed that those borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty.  Concessions granted under a TDR generally involve a reduction in interest rate, a below market interest rate based on risk, or an extension of a loan's stated maturity date. Nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings are restored to accrual status if principal and interest payments, under the modified terms, are current for six consecutive months after modification.   Loans classified as TDRs are designated as impaired.
The evaluation of the need and amount of the allowance for impaired loans and whether a loan can be removed from impairment status is made on a quarterly basis.  The Company's policy for recognizing interest income on impaired loans does not differ from its overall policy for interest recognition.
In addition, the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review our loan and real estate owned portfolios and the related allowance for loan losses and valuation allowance for real estate owned. They may require the allowance for loan losses or the valuation allowance for real estate owned to be increased based on their review of information available at the time of the examination, which would negatively affect our earnings.
The following table sets forth information with respect to the Company's allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated:

Securities Portfolio
Our investment policy is designed to manage cash flows and foster earnings within prudent interest rate risk and credit risk guidelines. The portfolio mix is governed by our short term and long term liquidity needs. Rateâ€‘ofâ€‘return, cash flow, rating and guarantorâ€‘backing are also considered when making investment decisions. The purchase of principal only and stripped coupon interest only security instruments is specifically not authorized by our investment policy. Furthermore, other than government related securities which may not be rated, we only purchase securities with a rating of AAA or AA. We invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Government obligations, U.S. Government agency issued securities, state and political subdivision general obligations and to a lesser extent in Corporate Bonds and Certificates of Deposits.
Mortgageâ€‘backed securities represent a participation interest in a pool of mortgages issued by U.S. government agencies or governmentâ€‘sponsored enterprises, such as Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"), the Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae"), and the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae"), as well as non-government, private corporate issuers. Mortgageâ€‘backed securities are passâ€‘through securities and generally yield less than the mortgage loans underlying the securities. The characteristics of the underlying pool of mortgages, i.e., fixedâ€‘rate or adjustableâ€‘rate, as well as prepayment risk, are passed on to the certificate holder.
Mortgage-backed securities issued or sponsored by U.S. government agencies and governmentâ€‘sponsored entities are guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest to investors.
Corporate bonds often pay higher rates than government or municipal bonds, because they tend to be riskier.  The bond holder receives interest payments (yield) and principal and is repaid on a fixed maturity date.  Corporate bonds can mature anywhere between 1 to 30 years and changes in interest rates are generally reflected in the bond prices.  Corporate bonds carry no claims to ownership and do not pay a dividend, but are considered to be less risky than stocks, since the company has to pay off all of its debts (including bonds) before it handles its obligations to stockholders.  Corporate bonds have a wide range of ratings and yields because the financial health of the issuers can vary widely,
Accounting standards require that securities be categorized as "held to maturity," "trading securities" or "available for sale," based on management's intent as to the ultimate disposition of each security. These standards allow debt securities to be classified as "held to maturity" and reported in financial statements at amortized cost if the reporting entity has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Securities that might be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in the security's prepayment risk, increases in loan demand, or other similar factors cannot be classified as "held to maturity."
At December 31, 2017, our entire securities portfolio was classified as held to maturity.  All securities were purchased with the intent to hold each security until maturity.  Securities not classified as "held to maturity" or as "trading securities" are classified as "available for sale" and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses on the securities impacting equity.  The Company held no available for sale or trading securities during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Individual securities are considered impaired when their fair values are less than their amortized cost. Management evaluates all securities with unrealized losses quarterly to determine if such impairments are "temporary" or "other-than-temporary" in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.  Accordingly, the Company accounts for temporary impairments based upon security classification as either trading, available for sale or held to maturity.  Temporary impairments on "available for sale" securities would be recognized, on a tax-effected basis, through other comprehensive income with offsetting entries adjusting the carrying value of the security and the balance of deferred taxes.  Temporary impairments of held to maturity securities are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements; however, information concerning the amount and duration of impairments on held to maturity securities is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  The carrying value of securities held in a trading portfolio would be adjusted to fair value through earnings on a quarterly basis.
11

Other-than-temporary impairments on securities that the Company has decided to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell prior to the full recovery of their fair value to a level equal to or exceeding amortized cost are recognized in earnings.  Otherwise, the other-than-temporary impairment is bifurcated into credit-related and noncredit-related components.  The credit-related impairment generally represents the amount by which the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected on a debt security falls below its amortized cost.  The noncredit-related component represents the remaining portion of the impairment not otherwise designated as credit-related. Credit-related other-than-temporary impairments are recognized in earnings while noncredit-related other-than-temporary impairments are recognized, net of deferred taxes, in other comprehensive income.
At December 31, 2017, our securities portfolio did not contain securities of any issuer, other than the U.S. Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, having an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of stockholders' equity.  We do not currently participate in hedging programs, interest rate caps, floors or swaps, or other activities involving the use of off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments, however, we may in the future utilize such instruments if we believe it would be beneficial for managing our interest rate risk.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the carrying values, weighted average yields and maturities of our held to maturity securities portfolio at December 31, 2017. Our held to maturity securities portfolio is carried at amortized cost.  This table shows contractual maturities and does not reflect repricing or the effect of prepayments. Actual maturities of the securities held by us may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. Callable securities pose reinvestment risk because we may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from called securities at an equivalent or higher interest rate.

Sources of Funds
General. Deposits are our major source of funds for lending and other investment purposes. To the extent that our loan originations may exceed the funding available from deposits, we have borrowed funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") to supplement the amount of funds for lending and funding daily operations.
12

In addition, we derive funds from loan and mortgageâ€‘backed securities principal repayments, interest, and proceeds from the maturity and call of investment securities. Loan and securities payments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by pricing strategies and money market conditions .
Deposits. Our current deposit products include checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit and fixed or variable rate individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Deposit account terms vary, primarily as to the required minimum balance amount, the amount of time, if any, that the funds must remain on deposit and the applicable interest rate. Our savings account menu includes regular passbook, statement, money market and club accounts. We also offer a six-level tiered savings account. Our certificates of deposit currently range in terms from 6 months to 10 years. Our IRAs are available with the same maturities as certificates of deposit accounts, with the exception of the 30 month term. We offer a two year certificate of deposit that permits the depositor to increase the interest rate to the current two year rate once during the term.
Deposits are obtained primarily from within New Jersey. The Bank may utilize brokered deposits and a listing service as funding sources.  As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had $32.4 million in brokered deposits and $24.7 million in listing service deposits.  Premiums or incentives for opening accounts are sometimes offered.  Periodically we select particular certificate of deposit maturities for promotion in connection with asset/liability management and interest rate risk concerns.
The determination of deposit and certificate interest rates is based upon a number of factors, including: (1) need for funds based on loan demand, current maturities of deposits and other cash flow needs; (2) a current survey of a selected group of competitors' rates for similar products; (3) economic conditions; and (4) business plan projections.
A large percentage of our deposits are in certificates of deposit. The inflow of certificates of deposit and the retention of such deposits upon maturity are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions, making certificates of deposit traditionally a more volatile source of funding than core deposits. Our liquidity could be reduced if a significant amount of certificates of deposit maturing within a short period of time were not renewed. To the extent that such deposits do not remain with us, they may need to be replaced with borrowings which could increase our cost of funds and negatively impact our net interest rate spread and our financial condition.
The following table sets forth the distribution of average deposits for the periods indicated and the weighted average nominal interest rates for each period on each category of deposits presented.

Additional information regarding our borrowings is included under Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 .
Subsidiary Activity
The Company has no direct subsidiaries other than the Bank. The Bank has one wholly owned subsidiary, Millington Savings Service Corp., formed in 1984. The service corporation is currently inactive.
Regulation and Supervision
The Bank and the Company operate in a highly regulated industry. This regulation establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which they may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the Deposit Insurance Fund and depositors. Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws that relate to the regulation of the Bank and the Company. The description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations.
Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on operations, the classification of assets and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, including changes in the regulations governing mutual holding companies, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank. The adoption of regulations or the enactment of laws that restrict the operations of the Bank and/or the Company or impose burdensome requirements upon one or both of them could reduce their profitability and could impair the value of the Bank's franchise, resulting in negative effects on the trading price of the Company's common stock.
Holding Company Regulation
General. The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the "BHC Act"), and is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve"). The Federal Reserve has enforcement authority over the Company and the Company's non-bank subsidiaries which also permits the Federal Reserve to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary bank. This regulation and oversight is intended primarily for the protection of the depositors of the Bank and not for shareholders of the Company.
As a bank holding company, the Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve an annual report and any additional information as the Federal Reserve may require under the BHC Act. The Federal Reserve will also examine the Company and its subsidiaries.
Under the BHC Act, the Company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before it may acquire control of another bank or bank holding company, merge or consolidate with another bank holding company, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or acquire direct or indirect control of any voting shares of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the Company would directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of such shares.
15

Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the BHC Act on extensions of credit to the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries, on investments in the stock or other securities of the bank holding company or its subsidiaries, and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Furthermore, under amendments to the BHC Act and regulations of the Federal Reserve, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or provision of credit or providing any property or services. Generally, this provision provides that a bank may not extend credit, lease or sell property, or furnish any service to a customer on the condition that the customer provide additional credit or service to the bank, to the bank holding company, or to any other subsidiary of the bank holding company or on the condition that the customer not obtain other credit or service from a competitor of the bank, the bank holding company, or any subsidiary of the bank.
Extensions of credit by the Bank to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders of the Bank or any affiliate thereof, including the Company, are subject to Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, which among other things, generally prohibits loans to any such individual where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15% of a bank's unimpaired capital and surplus, plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral.
Source of Strength Doctrine. A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, it is the policy of the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company's failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve regulations, or both.
Non-Banking Activities. The business activities of the Company, as a bank holding company, are restricted by the BHC Act. Under the BHC Act and the Federal Reserve's bank holding company regulations, the Company may only engage in, or acquire or control voting securities or assets of a company engaged in, (1) banking or managing or controlling banks and other subsidiaries authorized under the BHC Act and (2) any BHC Act activity the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks to be a proper incident thereto. These include any incidental activities necessary to carry on those activities, as well as a lengthy list of activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking as to be a proper incident thereto.
Financial Modernization. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act permits greater affiliation among banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other companies under a new type of financial services company known as a "financial holding company." A financial holding company essentially is a bank holding company with significantly expanded powers. Financial holding companies are authorized by statute to engage in a number of financial activities previously impermissible for bank holding companies, including securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; and merchant banking activities. The Act also permits the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to authorize additional activities for financial holding companies if they are "financial in nature" or "incidental" to financial activities. A bank holding company may become a financial holding company if it and each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized and well managed, and each of its subsidiary banks has at least a "satisfactory" CRA rating. A financial holding company must provide notice to the Federal Reserve within 30 days after commencing activities previously determined by statute or by the Federal Reserve and Department of the Treasury to be permissible. The Company has not submitted notice to the Federal Reserve of its intent to be deemed a financial holding company.
Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve has adopted capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the BHC Act. The Federal Reserve's capital adequacy guidelines are similar to those imposed on the Bank by the FDIC. See "Regulation of the Bank -Regulatory Capital Requirements." The Federal Reserve, however, has adopted a policy statement that exempts bank holding companies with less than $1.0 billion in consolidated assets that are not engaged in significant non-banking or off-balance sheet activities and that do not have a material amount of debt or equity securities registered with the SEC from its regulatory capital requirements as long as their bank subsidiaries are well capitalized, such bank holding companies need only maintain a pro forma debt to equity ratio of less than 1.0 in order to pay dividends and repurchase stock and to be eligible for expedited treatment on applications.
Federal Securities Law. The Company's common stock is registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and the Company is subject to the periodic reporting and other requirements of Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.
Acquisition of Control.  Under the Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire "control" of a bank company.  An acquisition of "control" can occur upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting stock of a bank holding company or as otherwise defined by the Federal Reserve.  Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition.  Any company that so acquires control is then subject to regulation as a bank holding company.
Regulation of the Bank
General.   As a New Jersey chartered, FDIC-insured bank, the Bank is regulated by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and the FDIC. The Bank's operations are subject to extensive regulation, including restrictions or requirements with respect to loans to one borrower, the percentage of non-mortgage loans or investments to total assets, capital distributions, permissible investments and lending 
16

activities, liquidity, transactions with affiliates and community reinvestment. The Bank must file regulatory reports concerning its activities and financial condition, and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and the FDIC regularly examine the Bank and prepare reports to the Bank's Board of Directors on deficiencies, if any, found in its operations. The regulatory authorities have substantial discretion to impose enforcement action on an institution that fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, particularly with respect to its capital requirements.
Federal Deposit Insurance. The Bank's deposits are insured to applicable limits by the FDIC. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum deposit insurance amount has been permanently increased from $100,000 to $250,000.
The FDIC has adopted a risk-based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments based on an insured institution's ranking in one of four risk categories based on their examination ratings and capital ratios. The assessment base is the institution's average consolidated assets less average tangible equity. Insured banks with more than $1.0 billion in assets must calculate quarterly average assets based on daily balances while smaller banks and newly chartered banks may use weekly averages. In the case of a merger, the average assets of the surviving bank for the quarter must include the average assets of the merged institution for the period in the quarter prior to the merger. Average assets are reduced by goodwill and other intangibles. Average tangible equity equals Tier 1 capital. For institutions with more than $1.0 billion in assets, average tangible equity is calculated on a weekly basis while smaller institutions may use the quarter-end balance. 
Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC amended its assessment regulations for established banks (generally, an institution that has been federally insured for at least five years as of the last day of any quarter for which it is being assessed) with less than $10 billion in assets to replace the previous risk categories with updated financial ratios that are designed to better predict the risk of failure of insured institutions. The amended rules became effective during the first quarter after the designated reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund reached 1.15% and will remain in effect until the designated reserve ratio reaches 2.0%. The amended regulations set a maximum rate that banks rated CAMELS 1 or 2 may be charged and a minimum rate that CAMELS 3, 4 and 5 banks may be charged. Under the amended rules, the FDIC uses a bank's weighted average CAMELS component ratings and the following financial measures to determine assessments: Tier 1 leverage ratio; ratio of net income before taxes to total assets; ratio of non-performing loans to gross assets; and ratio of other real estate owned to gross assets. In addition, assessments take into consideration core deposits to total assets, one-year asset growth and a loan mix index. The loan mix index measures the extent to which a bank's total assets include higher risk loans. To calculate the loan mix index, each category of loan in the bank's portfolio (other than credit card loans) is divided by the bank's total assets to determine the percentage of assets represented by that loan category. Each percentage is then multiplied by that loan category's historical weighted average industry-wide charge-off rate. The sum of these numbers determines the loan mix index value for that bank. The amended regulations are intended to be revenue neutral to the FDIC but to shift premium payments to higher risk institutions. A companion regulation assessed banks over $10 billion in assets at higher rates for two years in accordance with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation ("FICO"), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The FICO assessment rates, which are determined quarterly, averaged 0.545% of insured deposits on an annualized basis in 2017. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2019.
Regulatory Capital Requirements. The FDIC has promulgated capital adequacy requirements for state-chartered banks that, like the Bank, are not members of the Federal Reserve System. Effective January 1, 2015, the capital adequacy requirements were substantially revised to conform them to the international regulatory standards agreed to by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the accord often referred to as "Basel III". The final rule applies to all depository institutions as well as to all top-tier bank and savings and loan holding companies that are not subject to the Federal Reserve's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement.
Under the FDIC's revised capital adequacy regulations, the Bank is required to meet four minimum capital standards: (1) "Tier 1" or "core" capital leverage ratio equal to at least 4%  of total adjusted assets, (2) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, (3) a Tier 1 risk-based ratio equal to 6% of risk-weighted assets, and (4) a total capital ratio equal to 8% of total risk-weighted assets. Common equity Tier 1 capital is defined as common stock instruments, retained earnings, any common equity Tier 1 minority interest and, unless the bank has made an "opt-out" election, accumulated other comprehensive income, net of goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Tier 1 or core capital is defined as common equity Tier 1 capital plus certain qualifying subordinated interests and grandfathered capital instruments. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 or supplementary capital items, which include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying subordinated instruments and certain grandfathered capital instruments. An institution's risk-based capital requirements are measured against risk-weighted assets, which equal the sum of each on-balance-sheet asset and the credit-equivalent amount of each off-balance-sheet item after being multiplied by an assigned risk weight. Risk weightings range from 0% for cash to 100% for property acquired through foreclosure, commercial loans, and certain other assets to 150% for exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property.
The federal banking agencies have recently propsed to simplify the capital rules for smaller, non-complex banks, like the Bank. The proposal would simplify the calculation of acquisition, development and construction exposures for such banks and reduce their risk weighting to 130%. In addition, the proposal would raise the threshold for requiring deductions from capital for mortgage servicing assets and certain deferred tax assets as well as simply the calculation of the amount of minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries includable in regulatory capital.
17

In addition to higher capital requirements, the new capital rules require banks and covered financial institution holding companies to maintain a capital conservation buffer of at least 2.5% of risk-weighted assets over and above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The capital buffer requirement is being phased in over four years beginning January 1, 2016. The fully phased-in capital buffer requirement will effectively raise the minimum required risk-based capital ratios to 7% for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5% for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5% for Total Capital on a fully phased-in basis.
In assessing an institution's capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary.
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Under applicable federal statutes, the federal bank regulatory agencies are required to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to institutions that do not meet specified minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under the FDIC's prompt corrective action regulations, an institution is deemed to be "well capitalized" if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or better and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater. An institution is "adequately capitalized" if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 6.0% or greater, a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 4.5% or better and a Leverage Ratio of 4.0% or greater. An institution is "undercapitalized" if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5% or a Leverage Ratio of less than 4.0%. An institution is deemed to be "significantly undercapitalized" if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 4.0%, a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0% or a Leverage Ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be "critically undercapitalized" if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%
The prompt corrective action regulations provide for the imposition of a variety of requirements and limitations on institutions that fail to meet the above capital requirements. In particular, the FDIC may require any non-member bank that is not "adequately capitalized" to take certain action to increase its capital ratios. If the non-member bank's capital is significantly below the minimum required levels of capital or if it is unsuccessful in increasing its capital ratios, the bank's activities may be restricted.
At December 31, 2017, the Bank qualified as "well capitalized" under the prompt corrective action rules.
Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, every insured depository institution, including the Bank, has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The Community Reinvestment Act does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The Community Reinvestment Act requires the depository institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its community to be assessed and taken into account in the evaluation of certain applications by such institution, such as a merger or the establishment of a branch office by the Bank. An unsatisfactory Community Reinvestment Act examination rating may be used as the basis for the denial of an application. The Bank received a "satisfactory" rating in its most recent Community Reinvestment Act examination.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of NY, which is one of twelve regional federal home loan banks. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from funds deposited by financial institutions and proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans to members pursuant to policies and procedures established by its board of directors.
As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of NY in an amount equal to the greater of 1% of its aggregate unpaid residential mortgage loans, home purchase contracts or similar obligations at the beginning of each year or 5% of its outstanding FHLB advances.   The FHLB imposes various limitations on advances such as limiting the amount of certain types of real estate related collateral to 30% of a member's capital and limiting total advances to a member.
The FHLB is required to provide funds for the resolution of troubled savings institutions and to contribute to affordable housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. In addition, these requirements could result in the FHLB imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members.
