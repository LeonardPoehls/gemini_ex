Item 1.    Business.

We are an internally-managed Maryland corporation that focuses on the acquisition, renovation, leasing, and management of single-family properties in select markets in the United States. Our objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over the long term through dividends and capital appreciation. We generate virtually all of our revenue by leasing our portfolio of single-family properties. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 9,044 single-family properties in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas, excluding properties reflected as assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets.

We have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal tax purposes, commencing with, and in connection with the filing of our federal tax return for, the taxable year ended December 31, 2012. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on the taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Even if we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state and local taxes on our income or property.  In addition, the income of our taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs") is subject to taxation at regular corporate rates.

Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. was incorporated in Maryland in June 2012. Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. conducts its business and owns all of its properties through Silver Bay Operating Partnership L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), a Delaware limited partnership. Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp.'s wholly owned subsidiary, Silver Bay Management LLC (the "General Partner") is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2016, Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. owned, through a combination of direct and indirect interests, 94.1% of the partnership interests in the Operating Partnership.  Except as otherwise required by the context, references to the “Company,” “Silver Bay,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer collectively to Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp., the Operating Partnership and the direct and indirect subsidiaries of each.

Our principal executive office is located at 3300 Fernbrook Lane North, Suite 210, Plymouth, Minnesota 55447. Our telephone number is (952) 358-4400. Our web address is www.silverbayrealtytrustcorp.com.  Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol “SBY.”

Business Strategy

Our strategy is to acquire, renovate, lease, and manage single-family properties located in select markets in order to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over the long term through dividends and capital appreciation. We intend to hold our properties over the long term. Although we may consider the opportunistic disposition of assets, we have no predetermined investment horizon that would require their sale.
Management Overview
 Our approach to management relies on centralization of corporate oversight and certain property management functions. Immediate property management functions for properties are performed at the local level by our local employees or, in some markets, by third-party local property management contractors. As of December 31, 2016, we had 187 employees and managed 94.5% of our properties directly without the use of third-party property managers in ten markets (Atlanta, Phoenix, Tampa, Charlotte, Orlando, Dallas, Jacksonville, Southeast Florida, Northern California and Columbus). In markets managed by third parties, our regional asset management personnel oversee the local property managers in their performance of local property management functions. Our centralized platform consists of teams dedicated to (1) property management; (2) customer service and resident communication; (3) information technology; (4) marketing; (5) property renovations and maintenance; (6) acquisitions; and (7) treasury, accounting, legal and corporate matters. 
Acquisitions 

Our ability to identify and acquire single-family properties that meet our investment criteria will be affected by home prices in our markets, the inventory of properties available through our acquisition channels, competition for our target assets, and our capital available for investment. We employ a top-down selection process in our investment strategy which starts with identifying what we believe are the most attractive markets for developing a single-family rental business by evaluating existing and projected housing dynamics. Housing prices and rental demand are driven in part by macroeconomic and demographic factors. We scrutinize many of these factors, including existing supply of homes, vacancy rates, prior and projected population and household growth, prior and projected migration, regional building activity, mortgage delinquency figures, employment trends, income ratios, and price-to-rent ratios. 

Once in a market, we acquire single-family properties through a variety of acquisition channels, including brokers, multiple listing services, short sales, portfolio purchases from institutions or investor groups, foreclosure auctions and online auctions (although we have not used the auction channel in the past two years). We focus on maintaining a disciplined property selection process that incorporates local knowledge to better understand the fundamentals of the housing markets in which we operate, and we continually reevaluate the capital allocation among our markets in which we are making acquisitions. Our multi-market and multi-channel investment strategy provides flexibility in deploying capital and enables us to diversify our portfolio, mitigate risk and seek to optimize returns both within and across markets.
We conduct diligence on and underwrite each property we purchase. As part of the diligence process, our personnel conduct on-site assessments for broker and portfolio-sourced properties and drive-by inspections for auction-sourced properties. We also receive title commitments prior to closing for purchases outside the auction process and use a network of title insurance providers to conduct preliminary title work before purchasing properties through the auction channel. When underwriting a property, our personnel determine the maximum purchase price at which a property would meet our net yield requirements using a model that incorporates factors such as estimated rent, renovation costs, operating expenses, ongoing capital expenditures, and vacancy. Our underwriting process assumes that the property will be held for an indefinite period of time and does not reflect an assumed rental growth rate. This net-yield based price is then compared to the market price of the property, which is determined using comparable sales analysis, and reduced to the market price if the market price is less than the net yield based price. 
Acquisitions may be financed from various sources, including proceeds from the sale of equity securities, retained cash flow, debt financings, securitizations, or the issuance of common units in the Operating Partnership. Availability of

financing from such sources on acceptable terms will greatly impact our pace of acquisitions, as will our current preference for portfolio acquisitions, which are inherently less predictable than purchases through other channels. 
Property Renovation

Most of our properties have required renovation and standardization before they are ready for resident occupancy. We refer to the process of possessing, renovating, marketing, and leasing a property as property stabilization. Our renovation and maintenance approach is generally consistent across our various acquisition channels. We maintain system-wide standards for our properties that are implemented at the local level and directed at increasing attractiveness to potential residents, reducing future maintenance expense, and increasing the long-term value of the property. Our local project management personnel oversee the renovation of our properties in all of our markets. 
Following the acquisition of a property, our project managers use Silver Bay’s renovation standards, including any market-specific requirements, to prepare a project scope for initial renovation. Project managers then circulate the project scopes for bid to our approved contractors and vendors. All final bids are approved by construction managers. Once renovation work commences, local project management personnel oversee its quality of work and timely completion. Following completion of a renovation, our personnel perform a detailed quality control inspection to validate that the agreed-upon work has been completed and to determine that the property is in rent-ready condition. 
Operations and Management

General. Our leasing and management strategy seeks to maximize revenue by balancing occupancy and rental rates while minimizing our operating expenses. To meet these objectives, we focus on finding qualified residents and reducing resident turnover by providing quality and consistency in our customer service, maintenance, leasing, and marketing operations. Our approach to management and operations relies on centralization of corporate oversight and certain property management functions. Immediate property management functions for properties are performed at the local level in internally managed markets by our local employees or, in some markets, by third-party property managers.
Marketing. We establish the rental rates at which properties will be offered based on comparable rent analyses conducted by local property managers and reviewed by our regional property managers or chief operating officer. Factors considered in conducting comparable rent analyses include the size, age, condition, bedroom and bath count, and various qualitative factors, such as neighborhood characteristics and access to quality schools, transportation, employment centers and services of the subject home and the comparable properties. 
We conduct marketing activities for all internally managed markets from a centralized location to achieve consistency and quality in our advertising. We advertise available properties through yard signage, internet-based services, our website, multiple listing services and local leasing contacts. In markets with third-party property management, local managers use similar advertising channels for properties they manage. We use third-party leasing agents to show our properties to prospective residents. In markets with third-party property management, local managers schedule showings for properties they manage and use a mix of employees or third-party leasing agents.
Lease Applications and Approvals. In markets that are internally managed, we receive lease applications online by means of our website, and applications are centrally processed for consistency and efficiency. Through our technology, much of the screening process for prospective residents is automated, which reduces processing time for any lease applicant in internally managed markets. In markets that are managed by third-party managers, a similar process is followed. Our underwriting criteria and leasing standards are used to screen all prospective residents and determine whether to approve or deny any lease application. Third-party property managers follow a similar process when screening for the properties they manage and are provided our screening criteria for use in screening prospective residents. The application and evaluation process in all markets includes obtaining appropriate identification, an evaluation of credit and income, a review of the applicant’s rental history, a background check for criminal activity and income verification. Waivers of any threshold underwriting criteria or leasing standards must be approved centrally in accordance with our policies.
Rent Collection. We have established centralized collections for all of our markets. Residents may pay rent online via automatic clearing house, debit or credit card or through a variety of other electronic methods, or by check mailed to a lockbox. Residents who do not pay rent by the end of the grace period are sent a notice and assessed a late fee. Receivables are monitored centrally on a regular basis. If an eviction action becomes necessary in markets that we manage internally, we engage local counsel to assist in processing the eviction in compliance with local laws. Third-party property managers follow a similar process.

Resident Relations and Property Maintenance. As part of our ongoing property management, we perform routine repairs and maintenance as appropriate and manage resident relations to maximize long-term rental income and cash flows from our properties. We use a centralized call center for resident inquiries and maintenance requests. Residents can also contact us through the resident portal on our website in markets we directly manage. In markets with third-party property management, these third party managers handle repairs and maintenance and resident relations under the oversight of our regional managers.
Renewal and Turnover. We manage the lease renewal process centrally for all internally-managed markets. Prior to expiration of a lease, local managers receive a list of upcoming lease expirations and use comparable rent analyses to propose an appropriate renewal rate and new rent should the property become vacant. These rates are reviewed and approved by our regional property managers or chief operating officer. If a resident elects not to renew the lease, generally the resident will be allowed to remain in occupancy under a month-to-month tenancy with a rent at, or above, the existing rent. In markets managed by third-party property managers, a similar process is followed. 
In the event of turnover, each property is inspected after the resident vacates to determine the necessary scope of repair work, and where applicable, offset the costs of such repairs against resident deposits. We use an extensive move-in and move-out checklist to determine what repairs are necessary in preparation for re-leasing the properties. Marketing begins in advance of the lease-ready date to minimize the number of days the home is on the market. Third-party property managers use similar processes in the event of a turnover in the markets they manage. Turnover work is processed in a similar manner to an initial renovation with approval of certain high cost turnovers in all markets, oversight of turnover by the local property manager and use of a detailed quality control checklist. In markets with third-party managers, our third-party managers follow similar processes and receive approval for certain high cost turnovers.

Technology

Technology plays an important role in assisting us to build and manage a portfolio of geographically dispersed assets. We have developed and continue to develop a technological infrastructure with tools that:

• | centrally aggregate information from employees and third-party property managers;


• | provide our employees and third-party property managers with tools to facilitate their various roles, including mobile applications that reduce the need for time spent in the office;


• | screen target properties for acquisition;


• | allow real-time monitoring and management of the portfolio;


• | integrate property management, accounting and asset management systems;


• | enable the residents to interact with us online; and


• | use a secure and scalable cloud-based environment with mobile accessibility.

Dispositions

We periodically sell properties after determining the property or related market no longer fit our portfolio and may sell properties when we view market conditions are favorable given other potential uses of capital. One unique feature of single-family rental properties derives from the dual market for the assets: the investor market and the owner-occupant market. When comparing the two markets, selling into the investor market typically has the advantage of lower transaction costs, faster execution and a limited period of time (if any) during which we hold the properties without generating positive cash flow. Selling into the owner-occupant market often results in greater gross selling prices, the extent to which varies greatly market-by-market, but also involves higher transaction costs and a period of time from move-out of the prior resident to sale during which we incur costs without corresponding revenue. When we decide to sell an entire market portfolio, we generally solicit competing bids from investors, consider the sales price of each proposal and compare such price to our estimate of pricing in the owner-occupant market. We then execute the sales type that we believe will provide the greatest value. When we decide to sell an individual property, we generally sell the property into the owner-occupant market using the applicable multiple listing service.

Financing Strategy

To date, we have funded our acquisitions and other capital needs through a mix of equity capital, cash generated by our operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and borrowings in connection with our securitization. We entered our current revolving credit facility on May 10, 2013 and amended it on February 18, 2015 to increase the borrowing capacity from $200.0 million to $400.0 million and extend its term. The revolving period ended on February 18, 2017, and we are no longer able to draw additional amounts under the revolving credit facility. We closed our securitization transaction on August 12, 2014, which involved the sale of $312.7 million of certificates. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations," including "Liquidity and Capital Resources" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information regarding our revolving credit facility and securitization transaction. We continually explore additional capital options available to us, and our decision to pursue such options will be based on our assessment of a variety of factors, including the relative cost of the financing, the impact on our estimated net asset value and cash flow generation, and the available growth opportunities. 
Competition

The residential rental market has historically been fragmented in both its ownership and operations. We face competition from local owners and operators, as well as an emerging class of institutional managers. When acquiring single-family properties, we face competition from individual investors, private pools of capital and other institutional buyers which may increase the prices for properties that we would like to purchase and reduce our ability to achieve our desired portfolio size or expected yields. We also compete for desirable residents against the same entities as well as multifamily lessors. We believe that having an integrated and scalable platform with local market presence and using our wealth of existing in-house expertise provide us competitive advantages.
Seasonality
We believe that our business and related operating results will be impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year. In particular, we have experienced higher levels of resident move-outs during the summer months, which impacts both our rental revenues and related turnover costs. Further, our property operating costs and stabilized capital expenditures have been seasonally impacted in most markets for expenditures related to HVAC repairs during the summer season.
Regulation

General

Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws, and ordinances, and certain of our properties are also subject to the rules of the various homeowners’ associations where such properties are located. We believe that we are in material compliance with such covenants, laws, ordinances and rules and our leasing terms require that our residents agree to comply with such covenants, laws, ordinances, and rules.
Fair Housing Act

The Fair Housing Act ("FHA"), its state law counterparts, and the regulations promulgated by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and various state agencies, prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status (including children under the age of 18 living with parents or legal custodians, pregnant women and people securing custody of children under the age of 18) or handicap (disability) and, in some states, on financial capability and other bases. We believe that we are in material compliance with the FHA and related regulations.
Environmental Matters

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations, and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties as a result of environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties even if we no longer own such properties. See the discussion under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” under the caption “We may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities or restrictions related to properties that we acquire for which we may have limited or no recourse.”

REIT Qualification

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT, commencing with our initial taxable year ended on December 31, 2012. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels, and the diversity of ownership of our shares. We believe that we have been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and that we conduct our operations in a manner that will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT going forward.

As long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and will be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lose our REIT qualification. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state, and local taxes on our income or property. In addition, each TRS we own is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local taxes on its income or property.
Investment Company Act of 1940

We intend to conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act.
Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we had 187 full-time employees, which we supplement with temporary and contract resources. None of our personnel are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
