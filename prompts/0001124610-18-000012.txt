ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) pioneered the development and application of virtualization technologies with x86 server-based computing, separating application software from the underlying hardware. Information technology (“IT”) driven innovation is disrupting markets and industries. Technologies emerge faster than organizations can absorb, creating increasingly complex environments. To take on this challenge, businesses need a flexible and secure digital foundation. We provide compute, cloud, mobility, networking and security infrastructure software to businesses that provides a flexible digital foundation for the applications that empower businesses to serve their customers globally.
We continue to broaden our product and solution offerings beyond compute virtualization to include offerings that allow organizations to manage IT resources across private clouds and complex multi-cloud, multi-device environments by leveraging synergies across three categories: Software-Defined Data Center (“SDDC”), Hybrid Cloud Computing and End-User Computing (“EUC”). Our portfolio supports and addresses the four key IT priorities of our customers: modernizing data centers, integrating public clouds, empowering digital workspaces and transforming security. We create solutions that enable the digital transformation our customers need as they ready their applications, infrastructure and devices for their future business needs. 
We incorporated in Delaware in 1998, were acquired by EMC Corporation (“EMC”) in 2004 and conducted our initial public offering of our Class A common stock in August 2007. Effective September 7, 2016, Dell Technologies Inc. (“Dell”) acquired EMC. As a result, EMC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dell, and VMware became an indirectly-held, majority-owned subsidiary of Dell. We are considered a “controlled company” under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. As of February 2, 2018, Dell controlled approximately 81.9% of our outstanding common stock, including 31 million shares of our Class A common stock and all of our Class B common stock.
Effective January 1, 2017, our fiscal year changed from a fiscal year ending on December 31 of each calendar year to a fiscal year consisting of a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Friday nearest to January 31 of each year. The period that began on January 1, 2017 and ended on February 3, 2017 is reflected as a transition period (the “Transition Period”). Our first full fiscal year under the revised fiscal calendar began on February 4, 2017 and ended on February 2, 2018. We refer to our fiscal years ended February 1, 2019, February 2, 2018 and December 31, 2016 as “fiscal 2019,” “fiscal 2018” and “fiscal 2016,” respectively.
Total revenue in fiscal 2018 increased 12% to $7,922 million. Total revenue is comprised of license revenue of $3,195 million and services revenue of $4,727 million. While sales of our VMware vSphere (“vSphere”) product have remained strong, the majority of our license sales originate from solutions across our broad portfolio beyond our compute products.
We operate in one reportable operating segment, thus all required financial segment information can be found in our consolidated financial statements. For financial information on our business, including by geography, refer to Note P to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our corporate headquarters are located at 3401 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California, and we have 117 offices worldwide. 
Products and Technology Solutions
Software-Defined Data Center 
We were the first company to articulate a vision for SDDC, whereby increasingly infrastructure is virtualized and delivered as a service, enabling data center management to be entirely automated by software, from one unified platform. Traditional data centers are collections of technology silos where each application type has its own vertical stack consisting of a CPU and operating system, storage pool, networking and security, and management systems. Over time, costs to maintain the data center infrastructure have been increasing because the data center environment has become more heterogeneous, leading to higher complexity. The increasing complexity of the data center demands constantly increasing resources to manage and maintain the IT infrastructure. SDDC is designed to transform and modernize the data center into an on-demand service that addresses application requirements by abstracting, pooling and automating the services that are required from the underlying hardware. SDDC dramatically simplifies data center operations and lower costs.

Our SDDC architecture consists of four main product categories:

• | Compute


• | Storage and Availability


• | Network and Security


• | Cloud Management and Automation

Compute
vSphere, our flagship data center platform, provides the fundamental compute layer for VMware environments. A “hypervisor” is a layer of software that resides between the operating system and system hardware to enable compute virtualization. Users deploy the vSphere hypervisor when they purchase vSphere, Cloud Foundation or suite versions that include vSphere, such as VMware vCloud Suite and vSphere with Operations Management (“vSOM”). 
We have continued to develop vSphere solutions to be compatible with new technologies and tools utilized by software developers and enterprises. During fiscal 2016, we introduced our VMware vSphere Integrated Containers solution that allows customers to deploy containerized and traditional applications side-by-side on a common platform, without re-architecting their existing infrastructure. During fiscal 2018, we expanded our container solutions by announcing Pivotal Container Services (“PKS”), a new jointly developed, marketed, sold and supported Kubernetes container solution with Pivotal Software, Inc. (“Pivotal”), an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of Dell, and in which VMware has an ownership interest. 
Storage and Availability
We provide many storage and availability products to offer cost-effective, holistic data storage and protection options to all applications running on the vSphere platform. These products serve as hyper-converged infrastructure solutions designed to enable customers to deploy a broad range of hardware solutions. Key hyper-converged infrastructure solutions in this area include:

• | VMware vSAN (“vSAN”)—clusters server disks to create radically simple, shared storage designed for virtual machines.


• | VxRail—a fully integrated and pre-configured Dell EMC Appliance powered by vSAN and vSphere software that extends the VMware environment.


• | vSphere Replication—provides a cost-efficient and simple way to manage replication.


• | vCenter Site Recovery Manager—leverages vSphere and vSphere Replication to protect applications against site failures and to streamline planned migrations.

We experienced growth in both customer count and sales of our vSAN offerings during fiscal 2018. 
Network and Security
Our network virtualization solution, VMware NSX (“NSX”), abstracts physical networks and greatly simplifies the provisioning and consumption of networking resources. In addition, our security services are built-in, do not require purpose-built hardware and can scale with the network. AppDefense and Network Insight further broaden our network and security portfolio. AppDefense is a data center endpoint security product that protects applications running in virtualized environments. Network Insight delivers intelligent operations for software defined networking and security across virtual, physical and multi-cloud environments.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we acquired Velocloud Networks, Inc. (“Velocloud”), the market leader in cloud-delivered SD-WAN that enables enterprises and service providers to deploy flexible and secure WAN connectivity. 
VMware networking and security services enable our customers to connect, secure and operate their network consistently from the data center to the cloud and to the edges of their network. This includes providing networking and security capabilities to virtual machines, containers and public cloud workloads. NSX integrates with many automation, security and container solutions and is an integral part of our key offerings including VMware Cloud Foundation, VMware Cloud on AWS and PKS.
Cloud Management and Automation
Our cloud management and automation products move beyond core compute infrastructure to manage and automate overarching IT processes involved in provisioning IT services and resources to users from initial infrastructure deployment to retirement. These IT processes manage virtualized and non-virtualized infrastructure resources and private and public cloud infrastructures, including hybrid cloud services. Examples of products in the cloud management and automation product portfolio include:

• | vRealize Operations—provides performance, capacity and configuration management for virtual or physical infrastructure.


• | vRealize Automation—enables customers to rapidly deploy and provision cloud services.

5


• | vRealize Business—provides transparency and control over the costs and quality of IT services.

We acquired Wavefront, Inc. (“Wavefront”) during fiscal 2018 to enhance our cloud management and Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) portfolio. Wavefront by VMware is a SaaS-based metrics monitoring and analytics platform for modern cloud-native applications.
Software-Defined Data Center Suites
Our SDDC products are available separately or our compute and management and automation products may be acquired as part of a broader offering. The VMware vCloud Suite, vSOM and VMware vRealize Suite are packaged solutions for building and managing a complete cloud infrastructure optimized for use with the vSphere platform:

• | VMware vCloud Suite—an integrated offering that brings together our vSphere hypervisor and our vRealize Suite multi-vendor hybrid cloud management platform.


• | vSOM—allows users to optimize capacity and monitor the workload performance of their vSphere environments.


• | VMware vRealize Suite—an enterprise-ready cloud management platform that enables customers to manage heterogeneous, hybrid cloud environments.

Software-Defined Data Center Platform—On Premise
During fiscal 2016, we introduced VMware Cloud Foundation, a unified platform that brings together our compute, storage and networking technologies into a natively integrated stack that delivers enterprise-ready cloud infrastructure for private and public clouds. The combined offering includes lifecycle management capabilities to span the full stack. SDDC products can also be delivered through our VMware vCloud NFV, which is a fully integrated, modular, multi-tenant network functions virtualization (“NFV”) platform. It provides the compute, storage, networking and operations management and service assurance capabilities to enable operators to provide virtualized network services and drive NFV deployments with an architecture that will support 5G and Internet of Things (“IoT”) services in the future. 
During fiscal 2018, we introduced VMware Pulse IoT Center, an IoT device management and monitoring solution that helps both IT and Operational Technology (“OT”) organizations to onboard, manage, monitor and secure their IoT use cases from the edge to the cloud. This new solution has been built to meet the needs of IoT for both IT and OT teams, while supporting a broad range of edge systems and their connected devices. 
Hybrid Cloud Computing 
Our cross-cloud architecture enables consistent deployment models, security policies, visibility and governance for all applications, running on-premises and off-premises, regardless of the underlying cloud, hardware platform or hypervisor. It builds on our private and hybrid cloud capabilities by offering customers the freedom to innovate in multiple clouds, and is delivered through Cloud Foundation, the VMware vRealize cloud management platform and a new set of VMware Cloud Services that we are developing. Our overarching cloud strategy contains three key components: (i) continue to expand beyond compute virtualization in the private cloud, (ii) extend the private cloud into the public cloud and (iii) connect and secure endpoints across a range of public clouds. Our cloud strategy is designed to provide organizations with solutions that work across all clouds and all devices. 
VMware Cloud Provider Program Services
We currently enable our customers to utilize off-premises, vSphere-based hybrid cloud computing capacity through our VMware Cloud Provider Program (“VCPP”) offering (previously referred to as VMware vCloud Air Network). Our VCPP offering, a key component of our strategic priority to integrate with public clouds, is a global ecosystem of over 4,000 cloud providers in more than 100 countries providing VMware-based cloud services. Our VCPP offering is directed at hosting and cloud computing vendors, enabling organizations to choose between running applications in virtual machines on their own private clouds inside their data center or on public clouds hosted by a service provider. 
Hybrid VMware Cloud Foundation
VMware Cloud Foundation can be used for on-premises private clouds and also can be extended to hybrid cloud environments using VMware Cloud on AWS or VCPP. VMware Cloud on AWS, which became available in fiscal 2018, is an on-demand service that enables customers to run applications across vSphere-based cloud environments and provides access to a broad range of AWS services. This hybrid offering, a strategic alliance with AWS, integrates vSphere, vSAN and NSX along with VMware vCenter management and is optimized to run on dedicated, elastic, bare-metal AWS infrastructure. VMware Cloud on AWS is currently available in certain geographies, and we expect to continue expanding into additional regions in fiscal 2019.
VMware Cloud Foundation is also offered as a service platform to a global ecosystem of service providers through a select number of our VCPP partners. For example, IBM, OVH and Rackspace are VCPP partners who leverage our SDDC 
6

technologies to create cloud services addressing the needs of customers around the world. IBM was our first VCPP partner to offer VMware Cloud Foundation as a service, which enables their customers to leverage our SDDC technologies on IBM’s Cloud in their worldwide cloud data centers.
VMware Cloud Services 
VMware Cloud Services are new SaaS offerings that enable visibility into cloud usage and costs, enhance consistent networking and security policies and automate the deployment, management and migration of applications and data across vSphere and non-vSphere private and public clouds. VMware Cloud Services include discovery and analytics, compliance and security, networking and deployment and migration. VMware Cloud Services enable our customers to run, manage, connect and secure their applications across private and public clouds, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform and IBM Cloud, as well as all devices in a common operating environment, regardless whether the underlying infrastructure is VMware-based.
End-User Computing
Our EUC portfolio offers a digital workspace to enable our customers to securely deliver access to applications and data for their end users from any device of the user’s choice and from any location. Our EUC solutions are designed to optimize simplicity and choice for end users, while providing security and control to corporate IT organizations. IT organizations are able to enhance their enterprise security for corporate applications, data and endpoints utilizing our EUC solutions.
Our complete EUC solution consists of VMware Workspace ONE (“Workspace ONE”), our digital workspace platform. Workspace ONE is an integrated platform that securely delivers and manages any application, including legacy applications, on any device by integrating access control, application management and multi-platform endpoint management. Workspace ONE is powered by VMware AirWatch (“AirWatch”), which delivers unified endpoint management, and VMware Horizon (“Horizon”) application and desktop virtualization, tied together with a common access control layer: 

• | AirWatch—a unified endpoint management platform built to manage and secure endpoints across all major operating systems from a single management console, enabling deployment of native, web or remote applications through an application catalog across every device with built-in single sign-on. It provides the core foundation to support an increasingly mobile workforce and customer base, enabling customers to take advantage of “bring your own device” initiatives.


• | Horizon—a virtual platform that provides a streamlined approach to delivering, protecting and managing virtual desktops and applications from one digital workspace, while containing costs and allowing end users to work anytime, anywhere and across any device.

While AirWatch and Horizon are also offered separately, together this solution provides customers with a complete digital workspace solution that combines identity, mobile management, and application and desktop virtualization solutions. These technologies leverage our SDDC solutions, allowing customers to extend the value of virtualization and management from their data center to their devices. While many of these technologies are in use today, they are often deployed in silos across enterprise IT. Workspace ONE, which is offered as both an on-premises installed platform or as-a-service, integrates these silos to streamline the delivery of new applications and experiences. Workspace ONE continued to be our primary growth driver within EUC during fiscal 2018.
As we continue to expand our virtual desktop offering, we plan to offer customers the opportunity to run virtual desktops as-a-service through multiple environments including the Azure platform.
Technology Alliances
We have more than 1,000 technology partners with whom we bring joint offerings to the marketplace and over 4,000 active service provider partners. We classify our partners as follows:
Independent Hardware Vendors (“IHVs”) We have established relationships with large system vendors, including Cisco, Fujitsu, HPE, IBM, Lenovo and NEC for joint certification and co-development, and we continue to work closely with Dell. We also work closely with AMD, Intel and other IHVs to provide input on product development to enable them to deliver hardware advancements that benefit virtualization users. We coordinate with the leading storage and networking vendors to ensure joint interoperability and enable our software to access their differentiated functionality.
Independent Software Vendors (“ISVs”) We partner with leading systems management, infrastructure software and application software vendors-including healthcare, telecom, finance and retail leaders to deliver value-added products that integrate with our products.
VMware Service Providers We have established partnerships with over 4,000 active VCPP service providers including CenturyLink, Fujitsu, IBM, KPN, Macquarie, Navisite, NTT, OVH, Rackspace, Softbank, Telefonica, Tieto, T-Systems, UOL Diveo and Virtustream, to enable them to host and deliver enterprise-class hybrid clouds as a way for enterprises to extend their data centers to external clouds, while preserving security, compliance and quality of service. 
7

In addition to our base of active service provider partnerships, our strategic alliance with AWS to build and deliver an integrated hybrid offering, VMware Cloud on AWS, enables customers to run applications across vSphere-based private, public and hybrid cloud environments. VMware Cloud on AWS became available in fiscal 2018.
Our Technology Alliance Partner program facilitates joint solution creation and coordinated go-to-market activities with our partners. Over 4,600 of the most widely used applications from ISVs support the vSphere platform. These applications include business solutions for enterprise resource planning, human resource management, electronic medical records management, financial processing and middleware, such as application servers and databases. 
Our ISVs and other alliance partners, developers and additional VMware community members continue to distribute software applications as virtual appliances. We invest significant capital in testing and certification of infrastructure to rigorously ensure our software is compatible with major hardware and software products.
Research and Development
We have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development (“R&D”). We have assembled an experienced group of developers with systems management, public and private cloud, desktop, digital mobility, security, applications, software-as-a-service, networking, storage and open source software expertise. We also have strong ties to leading academic institutions around the world, and we invest in joint research with academia.
We prioritize our product development efforts through a combination of engineering-driven innovation and customer- and market-driven feedback. Our R&D culture places a high value on innovation, quality and open collaboration with our partners. We currently participate in numerous standards groups, and VMware employees hold a variety of standards organization leadership positions.
Our R&D expenses totaled $1,755 million, $1,503 million, $1,300 million and $150 million during the years ended February 2, 2018, December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the Transition Period, respectively. We continue to invest in our key growth products, including NSX and vSAN, while also investing in areas that we expect to be significant growth drivers in future periods. 
Sales and Marketing
We have a highly leveraged go-to-market strategy that includes a direct sales force, including a specialist sales force for our key growth products, and our channel partners.
We have established ongoing business relationships with our distributors. Our distributors purchase software licenses and software support from us for resale to end-user customers via resellers. These resellers are part of our VMware Partner Network (“VPN”), which offers resellers pricing incentives, rebates, sales and product training through the VMware Partner Central Web portal, and access to the worldwide network of VMware distributors. In addition, our channel partner network includes certain systems integrators and resellers trained and certified to deliver consulting services and solutions leveraging our products.
We generally do not have long-term contracts or minimum purchase commitments with our distributors, resellers, system vendors and systems integrators, and our contracts with these channel partners do not prohibit them from offering products or services that compete with ours.
End users can obtain licenses to our products through discrete purchases to meet their immediate needs or through the adoption of enterprise agreements (“EAs”). EAs are comprehensive volume license offerings that provide for multi-year maintenance and support at negotiated prices. EAs enable us to build long-term relationships with our customers as they commit to our virtual infrastructure solutions in their data centers. Our sales cycle can vary greatly depending on numerous factors, including the size and complexity of the proposed offering and customer’s infrastructure footprint.
In establishing list prices for our products, we take into account, among other numerous factors, the value our products and solutions deliver and the cost of alternative virtualization, end-user computing and hardware solutions.
Our marketing efforts focus on communicating the benefits of our solutions and educating our customers, distributors, resellers, system vendors, systems integrators, the media and analysts about the advantages of our innovative virtualization technology, cloud services and digital workspace solutions. We raise awareness of our company and brands, market our products and generate sales leads through VMware and industry events, public relations efforts, marketing materials, advertising, direct marketing, social media initiatives, free downloads and our website. We have invested in multiple online communities that enable customers and partners to share and discuss sales and development resources, best practices implementation and industry trends among other topics. Our annual user conference, VMworld, is held in both the United States (“U.S.”) and Europe, while our vForum events are held in the Asia Pacific and Japan region. We also offer management presentations, seminars and webinars on our products of virtualization, end-user computing and cloud services. We believe the combination of these activities strengthens our brand and enhances our leading positions in our industry.

During fiscal 2018, we continued joint marketing, sales, branding and product development efforts with Dell and other Dell Technologies companies to enhance the collective value we deliver to our mutual customers. As a result of these joint efforts, we have experienced significant synergies with Dell benefiting our sales during fiscal 2018. We also have strategic partnerships with AWS and IBM to jointly provide the expertise, solutions and go-to-market capabilities to help our customers efficiently and securely extend their proven software-defined solutions into public clouds, utilizing the tools and processes with which our customers are already familiar.
Our business is subject to seasonality in the sale of our products and services. For example, our fourth quarter revenue is affected by a number of seasonal factors, including year-end spending trends which impact the timing of renewals of our EAs and support and maintenance contracts.
Backlog
Backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders against purchase orders or executed agreements received at the end of the period and is presented net of related estimated rebates and marketing development funds. As of February 2, 2018, our total backlog was approximately $285 million, generally consisting of licenses, maintenance and services. Our backlog related to licenses was approximately $99 million, which we expect to deliver and recognize as revenue during the first quarter or fiscal 2019. As of December 31, 2016, total backlog was approximately $78 million and backlog related to licenses was approximately $27 million. We do not believe that the amount of backlog, as of any particular date, is indicative of future sales.
Customers
Our product offerings allow customers to manage IT resources across private clouds and complex multi-cloud, multi-device environments. Customer deployments range in size from a single virtualized server for small businesses to thousands of virtual machines and managed devices for our largest enterprise customers.
During fiscal 2018, three distributors, who purchased software licenses and software support from us for resale to end-user customers directly or via resellers, each accounted for over 10% of our consolidated revenue. Arrow Electronics, Inc., Tech Data Corporation and Ingram Micro, Inc. accounted for 15%, 11% and 10%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2018. Our distribution agreements are typically terminable at will by either party upon 30 to 90 days’ prior written notice to the other party, and neither party has any obligation to purchase or sell any products under the agreement.
During fiscal 2018, revenue from Dell, including purchases of products and services directly from us, as well as through our channel partners, accounted for 17% of our consolidated revenue.
Competition
We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services. We believe that the key factors in our ability to successfully compete include the level of reliability, interoperability and new functionality of our product and service offerings; the ability of our product offerings to support multiple hardware platforms, operating systems, applications frameworks and public cloud platforms; our ability to anticipate customer needs in rapidly evolving markets for IT resources; the pricing of our product and service offerings; the ability to integrate open source technologies that are critical in private and public cloud computing architectures; the ability to attract and retain key employees; and the ability to maintain and expand our ecosystem of technology partners, service providers and sales channel partners. While we believe that we are a technology leader in virtualization and cloud infrastructure solutions and have a strong, favorable image with our customers, many of our current or potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. Additionally, the adoption of public cloud, micro-services, containers and open source technologies has the potential to erode our profitability.
We face competition from, among others:
Providers of public cloud infrastructure and SaaS-based offerings. As businesses increasingly utilize public cloud and SaaS-based offerings, they are building more of their new compute workloads off-premises and may also shift some of their existing workloads. As a result, the demand for on-premises IT resources is expected to slow, and our products and services will need to increasingly compete for customers’ IT workloads with off-premises public cloud and SaaS-based offerings. If our private, hybrid and public cloud products and services fail to address evolving customer requirements, the demand for our virtualization products and services may decline, and we could experience lower growth. Additionally, VCPP offerings from our partners may compete directly with infrastructure-as-a-service (“IaaS”) offerings from various public cloud providers such as AWS and Microsoft. In fiscal 2018, we made VMware Cloud on AWS, a strategic alliance with AWS to deliver a vSphere-based cloud service running in AWS data centers, available in certain geographies. Our strategic alliance with Amazon may also be seen as competitive with VCPP offerings and adversely affect our relationship with VCPP partners, while some VCPP partners may elect to include VMware Cloud on AWS as part of their managed services provider offerings.
Large, diversified enterprise software and hardware companies. These competitors supply a wide variety of products and services to, and have well-established relationships with, our current and prospective end users. For example, small- to 
9

medium-sized businesses and companies in emerging markets that are evaluating the adoption of virtualization-based technologies and solutions may be inclined to consider Microsoft solutions because of their existing use of Windows and Office products. Some of these competitors have in the past and may in the future take advantage of their existing relationships to engage in business practices that make our products and services less attractive to our end users. Other competitors have limited or denied support for their applications running in VMware virtualization environments. In addition, these competitors could integrate competitive capabilities into their existing products and services and make them available without additional charge. For example, Oracle provides free server virtualization software intended to support Oracle and non-Oracle applications, Microsoft offers its own server, network, and storage virtualization software packaged with its Windows Server product, as well as built-in virtualization in the client version of Windows and Cisco includes network virtualization technology in many of their data center networking platforms. As a result, existing and prospective VMware customers may elect to use products that are perceived to be “free” or “very low cost” instead of purchasing VMware products and services for certain applications where they do not believe that more advanced and robust capabilities are required.
Companies offering competing platforms based on open source technologies. Open source technologies for virtualization, containerization and cloud platforms such as Xen, KVM, Docker, Rocket, OpenStack, Mesos, Kubernetes appear to provide pricing competition and enable competing vendors to leverage these open source technologies to compete directly with our SDDC initiative. Enterprises and service providers have shown interest in building their own clouds based on open source projects such as OpenStack, and other companies have indicated their intention to expand offerings of virtual management and cloud computing solutions as well. Additionally, a number of enterprise IT hardware vendors have released solutions based on OpenStack including IBM and Cisco. VMware is delivering container technologies such as PKS, which we co-developed and market in partnership with Pivotal, and vSphere Integrated Containers that are designed to help customers adopt micro-services architectures. The adoption of distributed micro-service application architectures, and their alignment with container technologies, represents an emerging area of competition.
Other industry alliances. Many of our competitors have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive virtualization and cloud computing solutions than they individually had offered. We expect these trends to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their positions in the evolving virtualization infrastructure and enterprise IT solutions industry. These alliances may result in more compelling product and service offerings than we offer.
Our partners and members of our developer and technology partner ecosystem. We face competition from our partners. For example, third parties currently selling our products and services could build and market their own competing products and services or market competing products and services of other vendors. Additionally, as formerly distinct sectors of enterprise IT such as software-based virtualization and hardware-based server, networking and storage solutions converge, we also increasingly compete with companies who are members of our developer and technology partner ecosystem. Consequently, we may find it more difficult to continue to work together productively on other projects, and the advantages we derive from our ecosystem could diminish. This competition could result in increased pricing pressure and sales and marketing expenses, thereby materially reducing our operating margins, and could also prevent our new products and services from gaining market acceptance, thereby harming our ability to increase, or causing us to lose, market share.
Intellectual Property
As of February 2, 2018, over 1,800 patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office have been granted or assigned to us. We also have been granted or assigned patents from other countries. These patents cover various aspects of our server virtualization and other technologies. The granted U.S. patents expire beginning in 2018, with the last of the expiration dates being in 2036. We also have numerous pending U.S. provisional and non-provisional patent applications, and numerous pending foreign and international patent applications, that cover other aspects of our virtualization and other technologies.
We have federal trademark registrations in the U.S. for “VMWARE,” “VMWORLD,” “VSPHERE,” “VMWARE VCLOUD,” “VMWARE VIEW,” “VMOTION,” “HORIZON,” “AIRWATCH,” “VREALIZE,” “VFABRIC,” “VCLOUD,” “VMWARE NSX” and numerous other trademarks. We have also registered trademarks in a number of foreign countries. 
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights and our brand.
We enforce our intellectual property rights in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Despite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the United States. U.S. patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, offering to sell, selling or importing into the U.S. products covered by the claims of granted patents.
10

Our granted U.S. patents, and any future patents (to the extent they are issued), may be contested, circumvented or invalidated in the future. Moreover, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing these patents. Therefore, the exact effect of our patents and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty.
Employees
As of February 2, 2018, we had approximately 21,700 employees in 117 offices worldwide, less than 5% of which were contracted through Dell. None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we consider current employee relations to be good.
We contract with Dell subsidiaries for support from Dell personnel who are managed by VMware on a full-time basis. These individuals are located in countries in which we do not currently have an operating subsidiary and are predominantly dedicated to our sales and marketing efforts. We use contractors from time to time for temporary assignments and in locations in which we do not currently have operating subsidiaries. In the event that these contractor resources were not available, we do not believe that this would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
