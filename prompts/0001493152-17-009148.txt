Item 1. Business.
General
 
We have recently moved our offices from Oakland County, Michigan, to San Diego, California, proximate to our agricultural and development projects in Baja California, on which our current business operations are focused. The purchase of a condominium unit on July 28, 2009 initiated our real estate development operations directed at purchasing income-producing residential real estate apartment homes, condominiums and houses in the State of Michigan.
 
As of April 30, 2017, we owned ten properties in Michigan, four of which were sold after year end. The Company is refocusing its efforts to its operations in Baja Mexico.


Our business model in Michigan since our initial property purchases in 2009 has been to acquire, refurbish and upgrade existing properties into more environmentally sustainable, energy efficient, comfortable and healthier living spaces so that they meet standards that exceed what is often the norm for most single-family homes, condominiums and apartments. Once a property has been acquired, refurbished and rented, the property is put back on the market as a residential property, with a favorable environmental profile.
 
Real Estate Development and Marketing Operations
 
Michigan
 
Since all lease agreements have expired and rentals are on a month-to-month basis, the strategy of the Company is to sell the current real estate portfolio in Michigan and concentrate on the same line of business in the Cielo Mar development. At this time, we do not offer managed properties as investment properties.
 
Environmental Objectives in our Operations
 
To make homes more comfortable, we try to, whenever practical, optimize space by creating openness, introducing more natural light, creating better storage areas, as well as aiming to improve insulation, all with a view to make even small condominiums and apartments eco-friendly and practical. This ideology, we believe, will increase property value as well as to further create tenant loyalty in the rental market.

For a healthier living environment, we use eco-friendly, paints, primers and adhesives; improve air quality through better ventilation and air filtration in heating and air conditioning system, whenever feasible.
 
Property Acquisition Strategy
 
Each property acquired utilized a separate wholly-owned limited liability company for that particular property. This limited the risk exposure to a particular property solely to that property. Our property management strategy is to deliver quality services, thereby promoting tenant satisfaction, maintaining high tenant retention, and enhancing the value of each of our operating real estate assets through eco-friendly improvements.
 
In analyzing the potential development of a particular project, we evaluate the geographic, demographic, economic, and financial data, including:
 

● | Households, population and employment growth; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Prevailing rental and occupancy rates in the market area, and possible growth in those rates; and 
● | Location of the property in respect to schools and public transportation. 

Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters
 
Under various federal, state, and local laws and regulations, an owner of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property. Those laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of remediation or removal of the substances may be substantial, and the presence of the substances, or the failure to remediate the substances promptly, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.
Insurance
 
We carry comprehensive property, general liability, fire, extended coverage and environmental on all of our existing properties, with policy specifications, insured limits, and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties.
Competition
 
In Michigan, we operate in a competitive housing market environment where a variety of individuals and corporations are trying to maximize gains on the acquisition of undervalued property through housing market conditions. We may experience competition from companies that have similar business models involving rehabilitation of properties using environmentally friendly renovation techniques, and there is no assurance that we will continue to be able to purchase residential rental properties at attractive prices or that we will not experience competition from other developers that are marketing energy efficient and environmentally friendly properties
Baja California
 
We have expanded our real estate development operations to include Baja California, Mexico. On February 11, 2016, we signed a definitive agreement with Inmobiliaria Contel S.R.L.C.V. (“Contel”) for Progreen to finance the first tract of land of approximately 300 acres which is being developed by Contel for agriculture use. Contel controls nearly 14,000 acres of agricultural land in Baja, including 2,200 acres plus a 3-year option on the remaining 11,500 acres. Of the total agricultural land, it is expected that between 4,000 to 5,000 acres may be suitable for farming, depending on the availability of water. The rest of the land could potentially be used for commercial and residential real estate adjunct to the farming operations, although we have not initiated any planning or development efforts in this regard. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer has made personal investments in this project, and has a 49.5 % minority partnership interest in Contel. The Company and its Chief Executive Office have no management or governance authority in Contel.

Agricultural operations will be branded under the name, “ProGreen Farms,” for which we have made application for a trademark. Four wells have been drilled on the first tract, and the growing operation have commenced with a first produce purchase agreement for chile peppers - from Agricola Consuela, an exporter/importer to the U.S. market.

Procon Baja JV, S.DE R.L. DE C.V
 
On June 17, 2016, the Company formed Procon Baja JV, S.DE R.L. DE C.V (“Procon” or “Procon joint venture”), a subsidiary owned by Progreen (51%) and Contel (49%). Procon is managed by a board of Managing Directors consisting of three members, of which two represent Progreen and one represents Contel, and Jan Telander, our CEO, is the General Manager of Procon. On January 23, 2017, Procon entered into a definitive purchase agreement for, and has taken possession of, a large tract of land situated near the town of El Rosario in Baja California, Mexico. The land, planned for residential real estate development, is bordering the Pacific Ocean and covers a total area of approximately 2,016 ha (5,000 acres) with 4.5 miles of ocean front. The execution of the deed transferring the 5,000-acre oceanfront property to Procon was completed on March 15, 2017, and a Master Plan for all of this land is being created for a resort-type retirement and vacation community with the name “Cielo Mar”. Translated into English, Cielo means “heaven” and Mar means “sea”, the Cielo Mar planned community thus being “heaven by the sea.” The first phase of the development of the master plan is underway.
 
In Mexico, as the land cost in Baja through our joint venture, is substantially below market price, we have a distinct advantage and will have a competitive edge as far as pricing is concerned. We initially found substantial amounts of water, which increases the value and attractiveness to the land.
