ITEM 1.                                                BUSINESS.
History
 
Supreme Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company, Supreme or we), is one of the nations leading manufacturers of specialized commercial vehicles including truck bodies and specialty vehicles.  The Company was originally incorporated in 1979.
 
In January of 1984, Supreme Corporation, the Companys wholly-owned operating subsidiary, was formed to acquire a company engaged in the business of manufacturing, selling, and repairing specialized truck bodies and related equipment.
 
General Description of the Companys Business
 
The Company has two operating segments  specialized commercial vehicles and fiberglass products.  The fiberglass products segment does not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure.  See segment information in Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Item 8).
 
Supreme manufactures specialized commercial vehicles that are attached to a truck chassis.  The truck chassis, which consists of an engine, drivetrain, a frame with wheels, and in some cases a cab, is manufactured by third parties who are major automotive or truck companies.  Such companies typically do not build specialized commercial vehicles.
 
Supreme offers a wide range of specialized commercial vehicles including truck bodies and specialty vehicles ranging in price from $4,000 to more than $100,000.  Supremes truck bodies are offered in aluminum, FiberPanel PW, FiberPanel HC, or SignaturePlate. Most of our products are attached to light-duty truck chassis and medium-duty truck chassis.  Supreme integrates a wide range of options into its truck bodies including liftgates, cargo-handling equipment, customized doors, special bumpers, ladder racks, and refrigeration equipment. Supreme is primarily a build-to-order operation with very limited production occurring in anticipation of pending orders.
 
The following is a brief summary of Supremes products:
 
Signature van bodies.  Supremes Signature van bodies range from 10 to 28 feet in length with exterior walls assembled from one of several material options including pre-painted aluminum, FiberPanel PW, FiberPanel HC, or SignaturePlate. Additional features include molded composite front and side corners, LED marker lights, sealed wiring harnesses, hardwood or pine flooring, and various door configurations to accommodate end-user loading and unloading requirements.  This product is adaptable for a diverse range of uses in dry-freight transportation.
 
Iner-City® cutaway van bodies.  An ideal route truck for a variety of commercial applications, the Iner-City bodies are manufactured on cutaway chassis which allow access from the cab to the cargo area.  Borrowing many design elements from Supremes larger van body, the Iner-City is shorter in length (10 to 18 feet) than a typical van body.
 
Spartan service bodies.  Built on a cutaway chassis out of durable FiberPanel PW, the Spartan service body is a virtual workshop on wheels.  In lengths from 10 to 14 feet, the Spartans selection of compartments, shelves, doors, and pre-designed options provides job-site protection from the weather while offering a secure lockable workspace.
 
Spartan cargo vans.  Built on a cutaway chassis and constructed of FiberPanel PW, the Spartan cargo van provides the smooth maneuverability of a commercial van with the full-height and spacious cargo area of a truck body.  In lengths of 10 to 14 feet and available with a variety of pre-designed options, the Spartan cargo van is a bridge product for those moving up from a traditional cargo van into the truck body category.
 
Kold King® insulated van bodies.  Kold King insulated bodies, in lengths of up to 28 feet, provide versatility and dependability for temperature controlled applications.  Flexible for either hand-load or pallet-load requirements, they are ideal for multi-stop distribution of both fresh and frozen products.
 
Stake bodies.  Stake bodies are flatbeds with various configurations of removable sides.  The stake body is utilized for a broad range of agricultural and construction industries transportation needs.

Armored SUVs.  Supremes armored SUV products offer the same outside appearance and interior as a stock model SUV, but with armored protection against hostile fire.  These protective vehicles are used both abroad by governmental agencies and for various domestic applications.
 
Armored trucks and specialty vehicles.  Supremes armored trucks and specialty vehicles include cash-in-transit vehicles as well as SWAT rapid deployment vehicles, prisoner transport vehicles, and a variety of other security vehicles.
 
Kold King®, Iner-City®, and Spartan are trade names used by Supreme in its marketing of truck bodies.  Kold King®, Iner-City®, FiberPanel® and SignaturePlate® are trademarks registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
 
Manufacturing
 
Supremes manufacturing facilities are located in Goshen and Ligonier, Indiana; Griffin, Georgia; Cleburne, Texas; Moreno Valley, California; and Jonestown, Pennsylvania.
 
Supreme builds specialized vehicle bodies and installs other equipment on truck chassis, most of which are provided through converter pool agreements or are owned by dealers or end-users.  These truck bodies are built on an assembly line from engineered structural components such as floors, roofs, and wall panels.  These components are manufactured from Supremes proprietary designs and are installed on the truck chassis.  Supreme then installs optional equipment and applies any special finishes that the customer has specified.  Throughout the manufacturing and installation process, Supreme conducts quality control procedures to ensure that the products meet its customers specifications.  Supremes products are generally produced to firm orders and are designed and engineered by Supreme.  Order levels will vary depending upon price, competition, prevailing economic conditions, and other factors.
 
The Company manufactures component parts including fiberglass-reinforced plywood in Ligonier, Indiana, and has extensive metal bending capabilities at all of its locations.
 
Supreme provides limited warranties against construction defects in its products. These warranties generally provide for the replacement or repair of defective parts or workmanship for periods of up to five years following the date of retail sale.
 
We purchase raw materials and component parts from a variety of sources.  Although we generally do not enter into long-term supply contracts, management believes that we have good relationships with our primary suppliers. In past years prices have fluctuated significantly, but we have experienced no material adverse problems in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts to meet the requirements of our production schedules.  Management believes that the materials used in the production of our products are available at competitive prices from an adequate number of alternative suppliers.  Accordingly, management does not believe that the loss of a single supplier would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Marketing
 
Supreme sells its products to commercial dealers/distributors, fleet leasing companies, or directly to end-users.  Products purchased by a dealer/distributor from Supreme are sold by the dealer/distributor to its own customers.
 
Supremes dealer/distributor network consists of more than 1,000 commercial dealers and a limited number of truck equipment distributors. Management believes that this large network, coupled with Supremes geographically-dispersed manufacturing facilities, gives Supreme a marketing advantage over many of its competitors.  Supreme generally delivers its products within 4 to 8 weeks after the receipt of orders.
 
Approximately 75 employees are engaged in direct sales.  Supreme engages in direct marketing to target markets and participates in industry and vocational trade shows.
 
Trademarks
 
The Company owns and maintains trademarks that are used in marketing specialized products manufactured by Supreme.  Management believes that these trademarks have significant customer goodwill.  For this reason, management anticipates renewing each trademark discussed above for an additional ten-year period prior to such trademarks expiration.

Working Capital
 
The Company had working capital of $58.2 million and $51.9 million at December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively.  The Company believes that its days sales outstanding, its days inventories on hand and its days payable outstanding are within normal industry levels.
Major Customers
 
During the year-ended December 31, 2016, one large national fleet leasing customer accounted for approximately 31% of the Companys consolidated net sales. During the year-ended December 26, 2015, two large national fleet leasing customers accounted for approximately 24% and 11% of the Companys consolidated net sales. During the year-ended December 27, 2014, one large national fleet leasing customer accounted for approximately 16% of the Companys consolidated net sales. The Companys export sales are minimal.
Competitive Conditions
 
The highly competitive nature of the specialized vehicle industry presents a number of challenges. With only a few national competitors, the Company often competes with smaller, regional companies. As a result of this broad competition, the Company is often faced with competitive pricing pressures. Other competitive factors include quality of product, lead times, geographic proximity to customers, and the ability to manufacture a product customized to customer specifications.
 
During favorable business cycles, the industry tends to experience an increase in smaller, regional competitors, and then a similar decrease during times of challenging economic pressures. With its national presence and diverse product offerings, the Company believes that it is well positioned to meet the competitive challenges presented.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
The Companys operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental and health and safety statutes and regulations including those related to emissions to the air, discharges to water, treatment, storage, and disposal of water, and remediation of contaminated sites. Additionally, the Companys products are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local safety statutes and regulations. From time to time, the Company has received notices of noncompliance with respect to our operations and products. These notices have typically been resolved by investigating the alleged noncompliance and correcting any noncompliant conditions.
 
Cyclicality and Seasonality of Business
 
The Companys business can be cyclical due to the normal replacement cycle particularly of its truck products (historically approximately seven years) being subject to customers delaying purchases due to adverse changes in economic conditions and other long range factors that can affect the transportation industry.  Seasonality arises due to the Company typically participating in bids for large fleet contracts.  If successful, the fleet orders generally require shipment of the truck bodies in the first and second quarters.  Additionally, our business depends on various factors that are particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and business cycles including: corporate profitability; interest rates; fuel costs; changes in government regulations (i.e. fuel standards); customer preferences; industrial, commercial, and consumer spending patterns; and availability of truck chassis.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, the Company employed approximately 1,450 and 1,400 employees, respectively, none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining unit. The Company considers its relations with its employees to be favorable.
Backlog
 
The Companys backlog of firm orders was $83.4 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $98.1 million at December 26, 2015.
