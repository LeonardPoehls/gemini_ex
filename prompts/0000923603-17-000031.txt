About FelCor and FelCor LP
FelCor Lodging Trust Incorporated (NYSE:FCH), or FelCor, is a Maryland corporation operating as a real estate investment trust, or REIT. FelCor is the sole general partner of, and the owner of a greater than 99.5% partnership interest in, FelCor Lodging Limited Partnership, or FelCor LP, through which we held ownership interests in 39 hotels with 11,500 rooms at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of 138,600,280 shares and units outstanding, consisting of 137,990,097 shares of FelCor common stock and 610,183 units of FelCor LP limited partnership interest not owned by FelCor.
Business Strategy
Strategy and Objectives. Our goal is to deliver returns to stockholders through earnings growth, asset appreciation and sustainable dividends. We strive to achieve this goal by building a well-maintained and diversified portfolio of high quality hotels in strategic locations, leveraging our core competencies to enhance the quality and earnings potential of our hotels, and continuing to enhance our balance sheet flexibility and strength while reducing our cost of capital.
Our core portfolio consists primarily of upper-upscale and luxury hotels located in major markets and resort locations that have dynamic demand generators and high barriers-to-entry. We sell, acquire, rebrand and redevelop hotels to increase our return on invested capital, improve overall portfolio quality, enhance diversification and improve growth rates. Our long-term strategy has six critical components:

• | Acquire Hotels that Further Improve our Portfolio Quality, Diversification and Earnings Growth. We seek to acquire high-quality hotels in markets with high barriers-to-entry and sustainable demand growth. We target properties that are accretive to long-term stockholder value, will provide investment returns that exceed our weighted average cost of capital and provide attractive long-term yields. Additionally, we seek properties that will improve the overall quality and diversity of our portfolio and we consider hotels that offer redevelopment and/or revenue repositioning opportunities that will further enhance returns on our investment. 


• | Sell Non-Strategic Hotels or Hotels Not Expected to Meet Our Long-Term Return Hurdles. We believe opportunistically selling hotels and reallocating capital to more attractive investments enhances our long-term growth, increases our return on capital and enables management to focus on long-term investments within our target markets. We consistently review our hotels in terms of projected performance, future capital expenditure requirements, market dynamics and concentration risk, and sell those properties in markets that are not expected to offer an attractive return on our investment or are inconsistent with our long-term portfolio strategy. 


• | Utilize Focused and Engaged Asset Management Approach to Maximize Returns at our Hotels. FelCor’s asset management is aggressive and hands-on. All of our asset managers have extensive hotel operating experience and thorough knowledge of the markets and overall demand dynamics where our hotels operate. With our long-standing and extensive brand relationships, we can significantly influence how their policies and procedures (most notably, brand strategy for marketing and revenue enhancement programs) affect us as hotel owners. We utilize our expertise and relationships to maximize revenue, market share, hotel operating margins and cash flow at every hotel.

• | Pursue Redevelopment and Repositioning Opportunities that Leverage our Development and Operations Expertise. We consider redevelopment and repositioning opportunities at our properties that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. Redevelopment opportunities may include adding guest rooms, meeting space and amenities (such as spas), and developing condominiums. Repositioning opportunities typically involve upgrading a hotel’s market position through converting to a superior brand, which can be done independently or in conjunction with a redevelopment. We are currently seeking the necessary approvals and entitlements to redevelop and/or reposition several of our hotels that are located in core markets and offer attractive risk-adjusted returns that are significantly above our cost of capital. 


• | Enhance Our Assets’ Long-Term Performance by Investing in High-ROI Capital Projects. We strive to spend capital prudently. Our capital strategy involves efficiently maintaining our properties over the long term and limiting future expenditure fluctuations, while maximizing our return on investment. We generally renovate several hotels each year to maintain their competitive positions and value. We routinely evaluate value-adding opportunities at our hotels, such as better use of existing space, new restaurant concepts and improved food and beverage operations. 


• | Manage Our Balance Sheet. We are committed to further strengthening our balance sheet by reducing leverage, extending debt maturities and taking advantage of opportunities to lower our cost of capital. Our improved balance sheet provides the necessary flexibility and capacity to thrive throughout lodging industry cycles. We will continue to reduce our leverage by, among other things, selling non-strategic or underperforming hotels and increasing operating cash flow. We also expect to reduce our cost of capital and enhance our debt maturity profile by refinancing or repaying higher cost debt and preferred stock in the future. 

Recent Achievements. We have continued making progress toward achieving our strategic objectives.

• | We sold two hotels in 2016 for $108 million total gross proceeds.


• | We reduced our consolidated debt by $74 million and leverage ratio from 6.0x at December 31, 2015 to 5.6x at December 31, 2016. Moody’s upgraded our corporate credit rating in 2016 as a result of our stronger balance sheet and credit metrics. 


• | In 2016, we renovated two hotels (Embassy Suites - Dallas Love Field and Embassy Suites - Orlando International Drive South/Convention Center) and began redeveloping two resort properties (The Vinoy Renaissance St. Petersburg Resort & Golf Club and Embassy Suites Myrtle Beach-Oceanfront Resort), which included the construction of significant enhancements and improvements to our resort amenities. In total, we spent $74.3 million on capital expenditure at our hotels, and believe our renovation and redevelopment projects will offer attractive returns. 


• | We successfully completed negotiations with Hilton with respect to new management agreements for 18 of our properties, with four currently pending lender approval. The new management agreements shift a substantial portion of fees from fixed base fees to variable incentive fees, which are payable only after achieving a base return on our invested capital. This new fee structure better aligns Hilton’s interest with our economic interest. We also negotiated comprehensive, long-term renovation plans at the affected hotels that allow us to deploy our capital more efficiently. We are excited to extend our strong relationship with Hilton, and we are confident the new agreements will help us achieve meaningful returns on these assets. 


• | We acquired the fee interest in the land at our Wyndham Houston-Medical Center Hotel & Suites that was previously leased.

• | We remain committed to the highest standards of Board accountability, corporate ethics and stockholder engagement. Accordingly, in 2016 we implemented various corporate governance enhancements, including, among others: (i) amending and restating FelCor’s 2014 Equity Compensation Plan to impose minimum vesting and post-vesting holding periods and to prohibit cash buyouts of underwater options; (ii) refreshing and enhancing the independence of the Board by appointing two independent directors to serve on the Board; (iii) adding a new section to FelCor’s Bylaws to provide proxy access to director candidates nominated by stockholders that meet certain ownership thresholds and satisfy other criteria; and (iv) amending FelCor’s Bylaws to delete a section that had reserved for the Board the exclusive power to amend FelCor’s Bylaws (stockholders will be able to propose binding amendments to FelCor’s Bylaws assuming they approve a corresponding charter amendment at this year’s annual meeting). The foregoing initiatives follow prior actions, as previously disclosed, that also strengthen our corporate governance and stockholder accountability. 

Our Industry
The United States lodging industry is diverse and fragmented, comprising a myriad of hotel types across multiple quality and service segments. The industry caters to a wide range of guests, including transient customers (both leisure and corporate), groups (both leisure and corporate) and long-term, or contract, customers. Average rates charged by hotels are dependent on multiple factors, including the potential customer mix, level of customer demand and rooms supply in the market. Many hotels are marketed under a brand or “flag,” such as Hilton and Marriott, among others. Franchisors typically receive fees in exchange for brand recognition, marketing support and their reservation systems. Other hotels operate independently, often because they do not desire to fit within the standards of a particular brand or, in some cases, because operating as an independent “boutique” hotel enhances a hotel’s appeal to targeted guests. Hotels, and the underlying real estate, are owned by both public and private companies and partnerships. Franchisors or independent management companies often operate hotels on behalf of their owners. All of our hotels are operated on our behalf, mostly by managers affiliated with international franchisors.
Hotel Classification. Smith Travel Research (STR), a leading research provider for the lodging industry, classifies hotel chains into seven distinct segments: luxury, upper-upscale, upscale, upper-midscale, midscale, economy and independent. More than 90% of our Hotel EBITDA is generated from luxury (Fairmont) and upper-upscale (Embassy Suites, Hilton, Marriott, Renaissance, Sheraton, and Wyndham) hotels. We also own upscale (Doubletree), upper-midscale (Holiday Inn) and independent (Knickerbocker, Royalton and Morgans) hotels.
Industry Performance. The industry is cyclical, driven by changes in supply and demand. Overall economic conditions and local market factors influence demand, as do GDP growth, employment growth and corporate profits. While lodging industry fundamentals remain relatively healthy, acceleration of supply growth, coupled with a deceleration in demand growth, is expected to result in lower Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) growth in 2017.

For 2016, STR reported:

• | RevPAR increased 3.2%, to $81.19, achieving the highest RevPAR ever recorded by STR for any year;


• | ADR increased 3.1% to $123.97, achieving the highest ADR ever recorded by STR; and


• | Occupancy increased 0.1% to 65.5%, as demand growth outpaced supply growth.

For 2017, CBRE Hotel Horizons (formerly, PKF Hospitality Research), or CBRE, another leading provider of hospitality industry research, projects occupancy to decrease 0.4%, ADR to increase by 3.3%, contributing to a projected 2.9% RevPAR increase in 2017. In its publication Hospitality Directions US, PwC’s outlook for 2017 RevPAR is a 2.3% increase, with an ADR increase of 2.6% and an occupancy decline of 0.3%.
Competition
The lodging industry is highly competitive. Customers can choose from a variety of brands and products. The interplay between the supply of and demand for hotel rooms is cyclical and affects our industry significantly. Certain markets have low barriers-to-entry (e.g., inexpensive land, favorable zoning, etc.), making it easier to build new hotels and increase the supply of modern, high-quality hotel rooms. Lodging demand growth typically moves in tandem with the overall economy, as well as local market factors that stimulate travel to specific destinations. Economic indicators, such as GDP, business investment and employment levels, are common indicators of lodging demand. Each of our hotels competes for guests, primarily with other full service and limited service hotels in the immediate vicinity and, secondarily, with other hotels in its geographic market. Location, brand recognition, hotel quality, service levels and prices are the principal competitive factors affecting our hotels.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in a property. These laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to related asbestos-containing materials. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require corrective modifications or other expenditures. In connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels or other real estate, we may be liable for various environmental costs or liabilities.

We customarily obtain a Phase I environmental survey from an independent environmental consultant before acquiring a hotel. The principal purpose of a Phase I survey is to identify potential environmental contamination and, secondarily, to assess, to a limited extent, the potential for environmental regulatory compliance liabilities. The Phase I surveys of our hotels were designed to meet the requirements of the then current industry standards governing those surveys, and consistent with those requirements, none of the surveys involved testing of groundwater, soil or air. Accordingly, they do not represent evaluations of conditions at the studied sites that would be revealed only through such testing. In addition, Phase I assessments of environmental regulatory compliance issues are general in scope and not a detailed determination of a hotel’s environmental compliance. Similarly, Phase I reports do not involve comprehensive analysis of potential offsite liability. Our Phase I reports have not revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations, nor are we aware of any such liability. Nevertheless, it is possible that these reports do not reveal or accurately assess all material environmental conditions and that there are material environmental conditions of which we are unaware.
We believe that our hotels materially comply with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding hazardous substances and other environmental matters, to the extent violation of such laws and regulations have a material adverse effect on us. We have not been notified by any governmental authority or private party of any noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our current or former properties that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations. However, obligations for compliance with environmental laws that arise or are discovered in the future may adversely affect our financial condition.
Tax Status
FelCor LP is a partnership for federal income tax purposes, and is not subject to federal income tax. However, under its partnership agreement, it is required to reimburse FelCor for any tax payments it is required to make. Accordingly, the tax information herein represents disclosures regarding FelCor and its taxable subsidiaries.
FelCor elected to be treated as a REIT under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. As a REIT, FelCor generally is not subject to federal income taxation at the corporate level on taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders. FelCor may, however, be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income. FelCor’s taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, formed to lease its hotels, are subject to federal, state and local income taxes. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income to its stockholders. If FelCor fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year for which the statute of limitations remains open, it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) for such taxable year and may not qualify as a REIT for four subsequent years. In connection with FelCor’s election to be treated as a REIT, its charter imposes restrictions on the ownership and transfer of shares of its common stock. FelCor LP expects to make distributions on its units sufficient to enable FelCor to meet its distribution obligations as a REIT. At December 31, 2016, FelCor had a federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of $534.2 million, and its TRSs had federal income tax loss carryforwards of $254.8 million.
Employees
At December 31, 2016, we had 63 full-time employees. None of our employees are involved in the day-to-day operation of our hotels.

Ownership of our Hotels
Of our 39 hotels at December 31, 2016, we owned 100% interests in 36 hotels, a 95% interest in one hotel (The Knickerbocker) and 50% interests in entities that owned two hotels. We consolidate our real estate interests in the 37 hotels in which we hold majority interests, and we record the real estate interests of the two hotels in which we hold 50% interests using the equity method. We lease 38 of the 39 hotels to our TRSs, in which we own a controlling interest. We operate one 50% owned hotel without a lease. Because we own controlling interests in our operating lessees, we consolidate our interests in all 38 leased hotels (which we refer to as our Consolidated Hotels) and reflect their operating revenues and expenses in our statements of operations. We own 50% of the real estate interest in one Consolidated Hotel (we account for our real estate interest in this hotel by the equity method) and majority real estate interests in our remaining 37 Consolidated Hotels (we consolidate our real estate interests in these hotels). Our Consolidated Hotels are located in 14 states, with concentrations in major urban markets and resort areas. 
Segment Reporting
Our business is conducted in one operating segment because of the similar economic characteristics of our hotels. Other information by geographic area may be found in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report.
