Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Bang Holdings Corp was incorporated in the state of Colorado on May 13, 2014. It is a brand management and advertising technology company providing content and an influencer-based marketing network to the cannabis industry, along with producing informed access to the multiple markets shaping the greater cannabis community. We are a development-stage company and since our inception we have generated only minimal revenues from business operations.
 
Bang Holdings Corp wholly owns, Bang Digital Media, Inc., a cannabis focused digital media company. Further, Bang Holdings wholly owns, Bang Technologies Inc., a tech company focused on investing in the research and development of artificial intelligence (A.I.) — specifically with regards to its implementation within the cannabis industry. 
 
Bang Digital Media is the hub for all ‘cannabusiness’ related advertising, content creation, technology and marketing. It consists of two divisions, the multi-platform 4TTnetwork, and a network of social media influencers that we call the Green Monkey Network. The 4TTnetwork is comprised primarily of specifically targeted audiences. These are 4TwentyToday, VaporBang, AmericanToker and HighOnStocks which cross the social media platforms of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, SnapChat and YouTube.


4TwentyToday and AmericanToker are digital, multi-platform channels that enables us to target advertising for Bang Holdings products and services across social media platforms. We currently have more than 2.7M users of our network, with a steady growth rate of around three thousand subscribers per week. By continuing to create targeted, quality content for this community on a daily basis, 4TwentyToday has, for example, created one of the most actively engaged cannabis pages on Facebook. This has built high levels of trust and goodwill in the community, which will be convertible to revenues once we have reached a critical mass of users.
 
Our most successful post on Facebook in 2016-2017 had 15.6 million views, leading to 1,832,507 “reactions,” 610,000 “shares,” and 164,000 “comments.” The post was created to build upon our social media footprint related to our business, not specifically towards our products. On Facebook alone between July 2016 and June 2017, Bang Digital Media’s pages accumulated 478.9M impressions, 46.2M engagements, and 65.1M video views.
 
The ‘Green Monkey Network’ is a network of social media influencers who are open to working as ambassadors in the marijuana industry. These influencers expand the Bang network by more than 30 million users.
 
Ultimately, the KPI (Key Performance Indicator) of Bang Digital Media is in the direct and expanded growth of our networks. By continuing to grow 4TwentyToday and the ‘Green Monkey Network’ to 100 million users we will have the digital reach to propel marijuana-friendly brands into the spotlight.

Marketing and Sales
 
The Company’s marketing strategy is a multi-pronged approach that includes viral marketing strategies, celebrity & social influencer endorsements, affiliate marketing, conventional online advertising and attending tradeshows. During 2017, we spent approximately $100,000 on the creation and growth of Bang Digital Media, the primary social media footprint of Bang Holdings Corp.
 
Viral Marketing: The marketing team aims to produce “hits” through the release of content developed by the Company on 4TwentyToday’s “YouTube” and “Facebook” pages, other social media, and our website. A portion of our marketing budget will be allocated to developing viral videos produced by our CEO, Steve Berke. Mr. Berke has had significant successes popularizing YouTube videos in the past, including, “Pot Shop,” which generated over 15 million views. In addition to Mr. Berke’s YouTube successes, his two campaigns for mayor of Miami Beach received national coverage, including the cover of the New York Times, the cover of the Huffington Post and a 6-page spread in Maxim magazine. Mr. Berke was named one of the top eight comedians to ever run for office by ABC News. We intend to capitalize on his popularity, and reputation as a leading advocate for medical marijuana, through 4TwentyToday, a channel on YouTube and Facebook to promote the Company.
 
Celebrity and Social Influencer Endorsements: We plan to establish partnerships with influential social media personalities and celebrities in several key genres to serve as brand ambassadors. Each brand ambassador will have their own affiliate website to sell future Bang branded products. By giving a unique platform to social media influencers to monetize their followings, Bang Digital Media will be able to build brand awareness and employ an army of influencers to sell product in order to become a leading brand in the cannabis space.
 
We intend to develop our business in the following areas:
 

● | Bang Digital Media entered into an agreement with Elevation Ministries (the “Church”), a non-profit entity founded and controlled by our CEO and two officers of the Company, to run their digital marketing, social media, and to manage exploitation rights of their ‘Church of Cannabis’ that launched in Q2 2017. The two-year contract signed and announced in Q1 2017, is expected to generate revenue of a minimum of $240K and potentially more than a $1 million with bonuses if we meet all the incentive targets.

● | Bang Digital Media recently entered into a social media agreement with the Bhang Corporation and with Julian Marley (reggae musician and son of the legendary Bob) along with his JuJu Royal brand of ultra premium cannabis. Bang Digital Media will build on this success model, while continuing to pursue new clients to coordinate digital strategy, social media management, video production, web development, and other online marketing services.
