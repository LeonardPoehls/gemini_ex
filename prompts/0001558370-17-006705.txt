Overview
 Immunomedics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing monoclonal antibody-based products for the targeted treatment of cancer, autoimmune disorders and other serious diseases. Our proprietary technologies allow us to create humanized antibodies that can be used either alone in unlabeled or “naked” form, or conjugated with radioactive isotopes, chemotherapeutics, cytokines or toxins. Using these technologies, we have built a pipeline of six clinical-stage product candidates. Our most advanced product candidate is IMMU-132 (sacituzumab govitecan), an antibody-drug conjugate (“ADC”) that has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) from the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (“mTNBC”) who have failed at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease. BTD has provided us with ready access to the FDA to discuss its Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions for IMMU-132, including the Accelerated Approval Program.
 At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders for 2016, a new Board of Directors was elected to embark on a new development plan for IMMU-132. After conducting a multifaceted assessment of the Company’s people, processes, and data to confirm the status of IMMU-132 development, the new Board, having recognized the significant potential of IMMU-132 and the Company’s capabilities, immediately adopted a new corporate strategy focused on bringing IMMU-132 to the market on its own for the benefit of patients with mTNBC and the creation of value for our shareholders. 
 To the best of our knowledge, IMMU-132 is the only antibody-based product candidate currently in clinical development that targets the cancer marker Trop-2. We chose this target because it internalizes rapidly into cancer cells following binding by the antibody, making it an ideal target for the delivery of toxic drugs with an ADC. Another reason is that Trop-2 is highly expressed by many and varied types of solid cancers. We believe that if IMMU-132 works in one of the Trop-2-expressing cancers, there is a good chance that it may work in other cancer types that contain the same marker. While this hypothesis is being evaluated in our Phase 2 basket trial, our current focus is to bring IMMU-132 to market for patients with mTNBC expeditiously via the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program. To that end, our foremost goals for IMMU-132 during fiscal year 2018 are as follows:

1. | Submit a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) to the FDA for accelerated approval of IMMU-132 in mTNBC between December 2017 and March 2018. Per FDA guidance, the following steps need to be addressed for the filing:;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


a. | Complete the review of treatment responses by an independent, third-party blinded group of radiologists and finalize the full data set of approximately 100 assessable patients from the Phase 2 trial of IMMU-132 in mTNBC. Enrollment of the full complement of more than 100 assessable patients was completed in December 2016;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b. | Initiate the Phase 3 confirmatory trial of IMMU-132 in patients with mTNBC. We have a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) in place for the study and clinical trial materials have been manufactured. In addition, we have engaged a Clinical Research Organization (“CRO”) and site selection and planning are currently underway;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c. | Validate all Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) processes on commercial manufacturing. We are required to validate all or part of CMC at the time of the BLA filing. The level of CMC validation required by the FDA at the time of submission will be a determining factor in the filing timeline.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Demonstrate CMC preparedness for large-scale manufacturing in anticipation of a potential commercial launch in the U.S. for IMMU-132 in early 2019. Although we have enough capability with our in-house manufacturing facility to produce commercial materials to support the launch and initial commercial
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  2


operations, our goal is to transition manufacturing of the antibody from in-house to a large-scale Contract Manufacturing Organizations (“CMO”) for longer term commercial production.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We believe our current focus on commercializing IMMU-132 as a third-line therapy for patients with mTNBC is also the key to opening the door to further commercial opportunities in the future including developing IMMU-132 in earlier lines of therapy in mTNBC, as a monotherapy or in combination therapies, as well as expansion into other indications beyond TNBC, such as urothelial cancer (“UC”), small-cell lung cancer (“SCLC’), and non-small-cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). It’s only by proving IMMU-132 in TNBC that we can explore, expand into, and potentially capitalize on these new opportunities. While our immediate focus on commercializing IMMU-132, on our own, in the U.S. and European markets; we are alert to opportunities to commercialize IMMU-132 in certain other regional markets; and we are also open to business development opportunities to develop other pipeline assets.
 Our Clinical and Preclinical Programs
 We believe that each of our antibodies has therapeutic potential either when administered as a naked antibody or when conjugated with chemotherapeutics, therapeutic radioisotopes (radiolabeled), cytokines or other toxins to create unique and potentially more effective treatment options. The attachment of various compounds to antibodies is intended to allow the delivery of these therapeutic agents to tumor sites with better specificity than conventional chemotherapy or radiation therapy approaches. This treatment method is designed to reduce the total exposure of the patient to the therapeutic agents, which ideally minimizes debilitating side effects. 
 Our portfolio of investigational products includes ADCs that are designed to deliver a specific payload of a chemotherapeutic directly to the tumor while reducing overall toxic effects that are usually found with conventional administration of these chemotherapy agents. In addition toIMMU-132, labetuzumab govitecan (“IMMU-130”), is in a Phase 2 trial for metastatic colorectal cancer (“mCRC”). These two ADCs facilitate targeted delivery of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, an effective, yet toxic chemotherapeutic, more directly to tumor cells. While sacituzumab govitecan and labetuzumab govitecan are circulating in the blood stream, our novel and proprietary ADC linking system keeps SN-38 conjugated to the antibody and in an inactive form, thereby reducing toxicity to normal tissues. The clinical safety and efficacy results obtained with sacituzumab govitecan and labetuzumab govitecan suggest that this half-life is long enough for the ADCs to reach their targets on the surface of tumor cells, without causing significant harm to the rest of the body. More importantly, the pH-sensitive nature of the linker allows the continuous release of SN-38 from the tumor-bound ADCs, regardless of whether the ADC is internalized or remains on the surface of the tumor cell leading to a locally enhanced concentration of SN-38 within or near the tumor. We believe this selective delivery enhances SN-38’s bioavailability at the tumor, which may improve efficacy while also reducing toxicity. 
 We have a research collaboration with Bayer to study epratuzumab as a thorium-227-labeled antibody. We have other ongoing collaborations in oncology with independent cancer study groups. The IntreALL Inter-European study group is conducting a large, randomized, Phase 3 trial combining epratuzumab with chemotherapy in children with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia at clinical sites in Australia, Europe, and Israel.
 We also have a number of other product candidates that target solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, as well as other diseases, in various stages of clinical and pre-clinical development. These include combination therapies involving antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies targeting cancers and infectious diseases as T-cell redirecting immunotherapies, as well as bispecific antibodies for next-generation cancer and autoimmune disease therapies, created using our patented DOCK-AND-LOCK® (“DNL®”) protein conjugation technology.

 Antibody-Drug Conjugates
 The targeted delivery of drug by an antibody is an exciting approach in cancer treatment that has gained significant interest over the past few years. ADCs are designed to deliver a specific payload of a chemotherapeutic directly to the tumor while reducing overall toxic effects that are usually found with conventional administration of these chemotherapy agents. We have a unique approach to ADC design that has allowed us to develop a platform technology with solid tumor therapy in mind. ADCs have three critical components – the antibody, linker and payload. Beginning with antibody, we have a suite of proprietary humanized antibodies, which are the result of 30 years of research and development in the field, and have selected highly cancer-specific antibodies to deliver moderately potent drugs to the tumors. We believe this approach permits a greater delivery of drug over repeated cycles of therapy, thereby improving the therapeutic index. Secondly, our patented linker technology is designed specifically for SN-38, which keeps SN-38 conjugated to the antibody and in an inactive form, thereby reducing toxicity to normal tissues. In addition, the pH-sensitive nature of the linker allows for rapid and continuous release of the drug once the ADC reaches a tumor. A high drug-to-antibody ratio also enhances the drug’s bioavailability within or near the tumor, which may improve efficacy while also reducing toxicity. Our payload drug of choice is SN-38, which is the active form of irinotecan, but is about 1,000-fold more potent. SN-38 cannot be administered directly to patients because it is not water soluble, and is too toxic. However, our unique CL-2A linker allows antibody-SN-38 conjugates to be soluble in water. Furthermore, there is no loss of antibody binding or drug activity. 
 As a result, all of our ADC product candidates have relatively lower toxicity and are capable of delivering greater doses of drug to tumor. They offer patients and physicians an opportunity for longer-term, repeated treatments. Two of our ADCs have completed Phase 2 studies in solid cancers. IMMU-132 targets a variety of solid tumors that over-express Trop-2, while our second ADC, IMMU-130 (labetuzumab govitecan), binds the CEACAM5 antigen, 

 
  4

expressed on colorectal and other solid cancers. We are also positioned to expand our ADC Program to treat liquid cancers with the creation of IMMU-140 that targets HLA-DR. 
 Sacituzumab govitecan or IMMU-132
 Sacituzumab govitecan is our lead investigational product for the treatment of patients with solid cancers. It is an ADC that contains SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, approved by many health authorities, including the FDA, as a chemotherapeutic for patients with cancer. As noted earlier, SN-38 cannot be given directly to patients because of its toxicity and poor water solubility. Sacituzumab govitecan was created at Immunomedics by conjugating SN-38 site-specifically and at a high ratio of drug to hRS7, our anti-Trop-2 antibody. Trop-2 is a cell-surface receptor that while over-expressed by many human tumors, including cancers of the breast, urinary bladder, and lung, has limited expression in normal human tissues. It internalizes rapidly into cancer cells following binding by hRS7, making it a suitable target for the delivery of cytotoxic drugs. 
 Sacituzumab govitecan has received BTD from the FDA for the treatment of patients with mTNBC who have failed prior therapies for their disease. The regulatory agency has also granted this ADC Fast Track designation for patients with TNBC and for patients with SCLC, or NSCLC. Fast Track designation is designed to expedite the development and review of applications for products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. This ADC has also been designated as an orphan drug by the FDA for the treatment of patients with SCLC or pancreatic cancer in the United States and by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer in the European Union. 
 Our Phase 2 basket trial of sacituzumab govitecan has now treated over 500 patients in more than 15 types of solid cancers, with the dose of 10 mg/kg given on days 1 and 8 of repeated 21-day cycles being the established dose regimen. TNBC is the furthest along with the most patients enrolled. In December 2016, we achieved the goal of enrolling 100 TNBC patients as requested by the FDA for a BLA filing. Interim results in 85 assessable patients with mTNBC were presented by our clinical investigator at an Investor R&D Day conducted during January 2017. Overall, 81% of patients treated with IMMU-132 showed tumor shrinkage from baseline measurements. Two of these patients experienced complete responses (“CRs”) and 23 reported partial responses (“PRs”), while an additional three patients with initial PRs are awaiting confirmation. The clinical benefit rate (CR and PR, and patients with stable disease (“SD”)) at six months or later was 44% and the median duration of response (“DOR”) for those with objective responses was 10.8 months. Median progression-free survival (“PFS”) and median overall survival (“OS”) for all 85 patients were 6.0 months and 18.8 months, respectively. To put these results in perspective, based on what has been reported in the medical literature, the current standard of care offers mTNBC patients a PFS of 1.7 to 3.7 months and about 12 months of median survival.
 The major toxicity (grade >3) has been neutropenia (39%) in this and most cancer patient cohorts, which has been managed by dose reduction, dose delays, or giving a hematopoietic cytokine. Diarrhea, which is the major side effect with irinotecan, has been much less, such as a grade >3 of 13%.
 As per FDA requirements, radiological scans from patients with at least 20% tumor shrinkage are being reviewed by an independent third-party group in a blinded fashion. The centrally adjudicated results will be part of a BLA submission for the accelerated approval of sacituzumab govitecan in mTNBC. The FDA also requires a confirmatory Phase 3 trial to be underway at the time of BLA submission. We have a SPA in place for the study and clinical trial materials have been manufactured. In addition, we have engaged a CRO and site selection and planning are currently underway. Details of this confirmatory trial can be obtained from clinicaltrials.gov website using the identifier NCT02574455. 
 In addition to TNBC, we are making progress with IMMU-132 across three other advanced indications: UC, SCLC and NSCLC. 
 In patients with UC, especially metastatic urinary bladder cancer, updated results were reported at the 2017 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium by our clinical investigator. A total of 44 patients with metastatic UC had been enrolled into this open-label multicenter study. Sites of metastases included liver (N=9; 25%), lymph nodes (N=14; 39%), lungs (N=14; 39%, pelvis (N=9, 25%), and bone (N=4; 11%). Patients received a median of six doses (range, 1-50) of sacituzumab govitecan, which was administered at 8 or 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of 3-week cycles. Despite 

 
  5

repeated dosing, grade 3 or higher adverse events were limited to neutropenia (30%), febrile neutropenia (11%), fatigue (11%), and diarrhea (3%). The objective response rate (“ORR”) in 36 response-assessable patients was 31%, including one confirmed CR and ten confirmed PRs. For the 41 intention-to-treat (“ITT”) patients, median PFS was 7.2 months and median OS was 15.5 months.
 For SCLC, despite the aggressive nature of the disease, encouraging ORR in 50 ITT patients was published online in Clinical Cancer Research on July 5, 2017. The median number of prior chemotherapies for this group of patients was 2 (range, 1-7). All patients had metastatic (stage IV) disease and had been previously treated with platinum-based therapy and etoposide, with 11 having received topotecan. Notable findings from patients after receiving treatment with sacituzumab govitecan at the dose level of 8 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg include:

· | Ninety-two percent of the patients evaluated for expression of the target for sacituzumab govitecan, Trop-2, had elevated levels in their archived tumor specimens;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Patients given repeated treatment cycles had manageable toxicity, mostly Grade >3 neutropenia (34%), and 60% of those patients experienced tumor shrinkage from baseline computed tomography (“CT”) measurements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ORR was 17% at the optimal dose schedule; the median DOR and OS were 5.7 and 7.5 months, respectively; and

· | Activity was observed in patients who were chemosensitive or chemoresistant to frontline chemotherapy, in patients who failed second-line topotecan, and in a subset who relapsed after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Phase 2 results with sacituzumab govitecan in patients with NSCLC were published online in the Journal of Clinical Oncology on May 26, 2017. In 54 heavily-pretreated patients with metastatic NSCLC who received either 8 or 10 mg/kg sacituzumab govitecan on days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles. The primary endpoints were safety and ORR. PFS and OS were secondary endpoints. Notable findings from the study include:

· | In the response-assessable study population (N = 47), which had a median of 3 prior therapies (range, 2-7), 67% of patients showed a shrinkage from baseline CT measurements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The confirmed ORR was 19.1%, the median DOR 6.0 months, and the clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD>4 months) was 43%. Responses occurred with a median onset of 3.8 months, including patients who had relapsed or progressed after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Median ITT PFS was 5.2 months (95% CI, 3.2, 7.1), and median ITT OS was 9.5 months;

· | Grade 3 or higher adverse events included neutropenia (28%), diarrhea (7%), nausea (7%), fatigue (6%), and febrile neutropenia (4%); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Over 90% of 26 assessable archival tumor specimens were highly positive for Trop-2 by immunohistochemistry.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Sacituzumab govitecan has a tolerable safety profile in these patients with diverse, advanced, heavily-pretreated solid cancers. No prophylactic diarrhea or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor medication to stimulate the production of neutrophils was given. More importantly, repeated doses can be given over months without evoking interfering anti-sacituzumab govitecan antibodies from patients’ own immune system.
 We have an extensive intellectual property portfolio protecting sacituzumab govitecan. Specifically, 35 patents were issued in the U.S. and 21 foreign patents were issued covering composition of matter, synthesis and uses. Certain patents relating to the protein sequence of the hRS7 antibody used in sacituzumab govitecan expire in 2017 in the United States and 2023 overseas. Patents to compositions and use of the CL2A linker incorporated in sacituzumab govitecan expire between 2023 and 2029 in the U.S. and overseas. Other patents relating to use of hRS7 for cancer therapy, including the SN-38 conjugated form of hRS7 used in sacituzumab govitecan, extend to 2033. Additionally, we are entitled to extend the term of our key patent for up to 5 more years. Outside the U.S., patents were issued in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and other key global markets.
 IMMU-130 or Labetuzumab Govitecan 
 Our second investigational solid-tumor ADC involves our anti-CEACAM5 antibody, labetuzumab, conjugated to SN-38. The agent is currently being studied in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (“mCRC”) who had received 

 
  6

at least one prior irinotecan-containing regimen and had an elevated blood titer of carcinoembryonic antigen (“CEA”). Several dosing schedules were evaluated in three Phase 1 studies. IMMU-130 showed therapeutic activity in all three trials, but a more frequent dosing schedule, with administrations of the ADC once or twice-weekly for two weeks followed by a week off, appeared to be more active in patients with mCRC than when administered every other week. 
 In the expanded Phase 2 study, patients were being treated in 3-week cycles, receiving IMMU-130 at 8 or 10 mg/kg once-weekly or twice a week at 4 or 6 mg/kg for the first two weeks followed by one week of rest. Updated results were presented at the 2016 American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting. A total of 82 patients were enrolled into the open-label study.
 Since there was no significant difference in safety and efficacy between the two once-weekly dosing schedules, for patient’s convenience, the once-a-week dose of 10 mg/kg was chosen for future studies in mCRC patients. 
 Certain patents relating to labetuzumab used in IMMU-130 expired in 2016. Other patents relating to use of labetuzumab for cancer therapy, including the SN-38 conjugated form of labetuzumab used in labetuzumab govitecan, extend to 2033.
 IMMU-140
 Our third ADC, IMMU-140, is comprised of the humanized anti-HLA-DR antibody, IMMU-114, conjugated to SN-38, through the Company’s proprietary linker, CL2A. When given subcutaneously, the parental antibody, IMMU-114, has shown promising activity in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”), and with a relatively safe profile. Thus, IMMU-140 is a dual-therapeutic, combining the signaling functions of the parental antibody, IMMU-114, with the cytotoxicity of SN-38. However, acute myelocytic leukemia (“AML”), despite having high expression levels of HLA-DR, has proven to be resistant to the antitumor effects of IMMU-114 in vitro. As a result, the potential treatment of AML, acute lymphocytic leukemia (“ALL”), and multiple myeloma (“MM”), continue to challenging for IMMU-114.
 We conducted a preclinical study to determine if SN-38, a drug not commonly used in liquid malignancies, would prove to be an effective and safe therapeutic when targeted with the IMMU-114 antibody, which could then improve the antitumor activity of IMMU-114. A total of four human cancer cell lines, AML, ALL, MM, and CLL, were used to examine the in vitro and in vivo activity of IMMU-140 versus parental IMMU-114. The results were presented at the 2016 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology.
 In seven human disease models in mice ALL, CLL, MM, AML, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”), Hodgkin lymphoma (“HL”), and melanoma), IMMU-140 treatment at 25 mg/kg twice weekly for 4 weeks (human equivalent dose (“HED”) = 2 mg/kg)  provided significant therapeutic efficacy compared to non-specific control ADCs.  Of note, in intractable AML and ALL, IMMU-140 imparted a >140% and 80% increase in survival, respectively, compared to IMMU-114 therapy.  Even a dose reduction to 12.5 mg/kg (HED = 1 mg/kg), produced significant antitumor effects compared to all controls in AML and malignant melanoma.  Though not significant, in MM IMMU-140 improved survival approximately 60% compared to IMMU-114 while in CLL, this treatment was significantly better than IMMU-114. Therapy with IMMU-140 was well tolerated by the mice with no appreciable loss in body weight.
 These preclinical results demonstrated IMMU-140’s higher potency than naked IMMU-114 in ALL and AML; and an added, if not significant, survival benefit in experimental MM and CLL. More importantly, the dual-therapeutic potential of IMMU-140 allows for the ability to treat a range of HLA-DR-positive hematopoietic and solid cancers, and therefore warrants further clinical development.
     Other Product Candidates 
 We have additional potential products for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases including epratuzumab, our anti-CD22 antibody; veltuzumab, our anti-CD20 antibody; milatuzumab, our anti-CD74 antibody; and IMMU-114, a humanized anti-HLA-DR antibody.

 Epratuzumab
 Epratuzumab is a humanized antibody that targets CD22, an antigen found on the surface of B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell critical to proper immune system function. Elevated expression of CD22 and other B-cell receptor-associated (“BCR”) proteins on B lymphocytes has been associated with blood cancers and autoimmune diseases. Epratuzumab’s mechanism of action includes the transfer of BCR-proteins to helper cells called effector cells, thereby reducing B-cell destruction and the impact of epratuzumab on the immune system. We believe epratuzumab is the only antibody in development targeting the reduction of these proteins without severely depleting B-cells through a process known as trogocytosis. 
 We have a research collaboration with The Bayer Group (“Bayer”) to study epratuzumab as a thorium-227 labeled antibody. Bayer is currently enrolling patients with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive NHL into a Phase 1 study evaluating epratuzumab labeled with thorium-227. This study is focusing on patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and potentially follicular lymphomas who have been previously treated with, or are not considered candidates for available therapies.
 In addition, the IntreALL Inter-European study group is conducting a large, randomized, Phase 3 trial combining epratuzumab with chemotherapy in children with relapsed ALL at clinical sites in Australia, Europe, and Israel. This Phase 3 study, which is partially funded by the European Commission, assesses the efficacy and safety of this combination therapy using event-free survival as the surrogate for survival, the primary endpoint. 
 Although certain patents to the epratuzumab protein sequence expired in 2014 in the United States and in 2015 overseas, other patents issued to therapeutic use of epratuzumab extend to 2018-2023 for cancer and 2020 for autoimmune disease. The method of preparing concentrated epratuzumab for subcutaneous administration is covered by another patent family with expiration in the United States in 2032.
 Veltuzumab 
 Veltuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 receptors on B lymphocytes currently under development for the treatment of NHL and autoimmune diseases. The Office of Orphan Products Development of the FDA has granted orphan status for the use of veltuzumab for the treatment of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (“ITP”). We have studied the subcutaneous formulation of veltuzumab in patients with ITP in a Phase 1/2 trial, which was designed to evaluate different dosing schedules. This trial has completed patient accrual and patients are being followed for up to five years.
 We are currently evaluating various options for further clinical development of veltuzumab in ITP and other autoimmune disease indications, as well as in oncology, including licensing arrangements and collaborations with outside study groups.
 Milatuzumab 
 Milatuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting tumors that express the CD74 antigen, which is present on a variety of hematological tumors and even on some solid cancers, with restricted expression by normal tissues. It has received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma or CLL. Milatuzumab is the first anti-CD74 antibody that has entered into human testing and we have completed initial Phase 1 studies in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, NHL or CLL.  
 The anti-CD74 antibody is currently being studied subcutaneously in autoimmune disease in a Phase 1b study in patients with active SLE supported by a three-year research grant from the United States Department of Defense with a potential funding of $2 million.
 Our interest in pursuing milatuzumab in immune diseases is driven by the observations that implicated CD74 in antigen presentation, particularly by dendritic and other immune cells—and as a survival factor for rapidly proliferating malignant cells. Recent findings have determined that CD74 is a receptor for the pro-inflammatory chemokine, macrophage migration-inhibitory factor, and that binding of the factor to CD74 initiates a signaling cascade resulting in proliferation and survival of normal and malignant B cells, such as in CLL. Migration-inhibitory factor is widely expressed by immune cells, particularly macrophages, and is known to play a role in autoimmune disease. Thus, we 

 
  8

believe that milatuzumab, by blocking the function of CD74, could be useful in the management of immune diseases either alone or in combination with other agents including other B-cell antibodies, such as epratuzumab and veltuzumab.
 First results from the open-label Phase 1b study of subcutaneously administered milatuzumab in an initial cohort of ten adult patients with moderate lupus disease activity but not severe flares (at least 2 BILAG B scores, but no A's) were presented at a poster session during the 2016 annual European League Against Rheumatism (“EULAR”) Congress. Based on the early encouraging results, we have expanded the study into a double-blind, placebo-controlled 30-patient randomized trial to confirm the activity of milatuzumab in this population and have received approval from the Department of Defense for an increased budget to support the expansion.
     IMMU-114 
 IMMU-114 is a novel humanized antibody directed against an immune response target, HLA-DR, under development for the treatment of patients with B-cell and other cancers. HLA-DR is a receptor located on the cell surface and its role is to present foreign objects to the immune system for the purpose of eliciting an immune response. Increased presence of HLA-DR in hematologic cancers has made it a prime target for antibody therapy.
 Although other anti-HLA-DR antibodies have been developed, IMMU-114 is distinguished by having a different immunoglobulin class, IgG4, which does not function by the usual effector-cell activities of antibodies, such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity (“CDC”) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (“ADCC”). As a result, IMMU-114 does not rely on an intact immune system in the patient to kill tumor cells. Furthermore, because ADCC and CDC are believed to play a major role in causing the side effects of antibody therapy, we expect IMMU-114 to be less toxic to patients.
 By targeting HLA-DR, a receptor that is different from the antigen targeted by rituximab or other antibodies in development for NHL and other B-cell malignancies, IMMU-114 may represent a new tool in the arsenal to combat these cancers. The anti-HLA-DR antibody is being evaluated as a subcutaneously-administered monotherapy for patients with NHL or CLL in a Phase 1 study. 
     Subcutaneous injections of IMMU-114 produced encouraging efficacy in a Phase 1 first-in-man study in patients with advanced, relapsed NHL and CLL. The injections were well tolerated by patients, with only local skin reactions at the injection sites, which were all mild to moderate and transient. Furthermore, only one patient had evidence of immunogenicity of uncertain significance and no other cytopenias or changes in routine safety laboratory results occurred.
 Our Platform Technologies
 In our drive to improve targeted therapies of diseases, we have built significant expertise in antibody engineering, particularly proprietary CDR-grafting methods, antibody production and formulation, immunochemistry, molecular biology, antibody conjugation, peptide chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and protein engineering.
 Beginning with our unique grafting technique to engineer humanized antibodies, our antibody humanization platform has produced a diverse portfolio of therapeutic agents that are in multiple stages of clinical trials for the therapy of cancer and autoimmune diseases, as detailed above. These humanized antibodies are well tolerated and also have a low incidence of immunogenicity. 
 With the successful humanized antibody platform as a foundation, we have built a robust ADC program using our own proprietary ADC linker technology. Finally, our protein engineering platform technology called DOCK-AND-LOCK® combines conjugation chemistry and genetic engineering to produce bioactive molecules of increasing complexity.
 ADC Linker Technology
 We developed a novel ADC platform using our proprietary linker, CL2A, which was designed with targeted delivery of SN-38 in mind. SN-38 is about 3 orders of magnitude (100 to 1,000 times) more potent than irinotecan, its 

 
  9

parent drug, but it cannot be administered systemically to patients because of its poor water solubility and toxicity. Our linker, CL2A, allows us to produce SN-38 conjugates that are soluble in water with excellent yields while preserving antibody binding and drug activity.
 CL2A contains an antibody coupling group on one end and a chemical group on the other for binding with a drug. We have also added a short polyethylene glycol to improve the solubility of CL2A. 

 Furthermore, because SN-38 can be converted from its active lactone form to the inactive carboxylate form, CL2A was designed to attach close to the lactone ring to prevent it from opening up, thereby maintaining the activity of SN-38. Another key feature of our ADC platform is that the linkage between CL2A and SN-38 is sensitive to both acidic and alkaline conditions and will allow the detachment of SN-38 at a rate of about 50% per day in vivo.

 The final structure of our ADC is depicted below, with the pH-sensitive cleavable linkage highlighted. What differentiates our ADC platform from other companies is the high drug-to-antibody ratio of about seven to eight molecules of drug per antibody. That is to say, when our ADCs bind to their targets on cancer cells, they are delivering up to eight molecules of SN-38 per antibody molecule into the blood or at the vicinity of the tumor, which may explain why our ADCs can deliver more than 120-times the amount of SN-38 to the tumor when studied in an animal model, as compared to irinotecan, the parent compound. We can deliver this drug concentration because our drug is not supertoxic, thus permitting us to give higher antibody doses, in repeated therapy cycles, that we believe provide a better therapeutic index.

         DOCK-AND-LOCK® Platform Technology
 We developed a platform technology, called the DOCK-AND-LOCK® method, which has the potential for making a considerable number of bioactive molecules of increasing complexity. DNL® utilizes the natural interaction between two human proteins, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (“PKA”) and A-kinase anchoring proteins (“AKAPs”). The region that is involved in such interaction for PKA is called the dimerization and docking domain, (“DDD”), which always is produced in pairs. Its binding partner in AKAPs is the anchoring domain (“AD”). When mixed together, DDD and AD will bind with each other spontaneously to form a binary complex, a process termed docking. Once “docked,” certain amino acid residues incorporated into DDD and AD will react with each other to “lock” them into a stably-tethered structure. The outcome of the DNL® method is the exclusive generation of a stable complex, in a quantitative manner that retains the full biological activities of its individual components.
 DNL® combines conjugation chemistry and genetic engineering to enable the creation of novel human therapeutics, and the potential construction of improved recombinant products over those currently on the market. Diverse drugs, chemical polymers, proteins, peptides, and nucleic acids are among suitable components that can be linked to either DDD or AD. Since the invention of DNL®, we have created multivalent, mono- or multi-specific antibodies, DNL-PEGylated cytokines; and cytokine-antibody conjugates.
 We have employed DNL® to create bispecific antibodies targeting cancers as a T-cell redirecting immunotherapy. This is one of several new methods of cancer immunotherapy being studied both clinically and preclinically by many other commercial and academic groups. In contrast to hematological tumors, little progress has been made in this approach to treat the more challenging solid cancers, including pancreatic and gastric cancers, two malignancies with very high rates of mortality. 
 In this regard, we are developing a novel investigational T-cell redirecting bispecific antibody, (E1)-3s, created using DNL® for the potential treatment of pancreatic and gastric cancers. These and various other solid cancers express high-levels of Trop-2, a target recognized by the bispecific (E1)-3s, which also binds to the CD3 antigen on T cells. (E1)-3s effectively induced a potent and specific T-cell-mediated killing of human pancreatic and gastric cancer cell lines. 

 
  11

Furthermore, in animal models of human pancreatic or gastric cancer, treatment with (E1)-3s significantly inhibited tumor growth, which resulted in improved survival compared with the control groups. Adding IFNα enhanced the tumor-growth-inhibition activity of (E1)-3s.
 As with all candidate therapeutic molecules developed by us, the safety and potential efficacy cannot be predicted until sufficient trials in humans have been conducted.
 Immuno-Oncology
 Harnessing the patient's own immune system to control metastatic disease has become an exciting approach in cancer therapy, particularly inhibitors of programmed cell death, such as PD-1. The approval of two such agents, as well as an antibody that inhibits T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (“CTLA4”), has spurred interest in their combination with other therapies in order to achieve synergy, whereby superior effects are achieved. We have begun to develop our own PD-1 antibody to evaluate its use in combination with our other anticancer agents in preclinical studies, such as the ADCs described above.
 Another immunotherapy of current interest is utilizing chimeric antigen receptors (“CARs”) to direct T cells known as natural killer cells. The engineering of chimeric antigen receptors on the surface of such cells combines the potent functions of the effector cells with the tumor-targeting properties of the antibodies. To-date, clinical results using CAR-redirected immunotherapy have appeared to be more successful in liquid (hematological) tumors than in solid cancers. Using our own genetic engineering technology, our scientists have begun work on a more universal approach to direct effector cells to a variety of cancer types by a next-generation targeting model. Preclinical studies are in progress while patents to protect the intellectual property are being prosecuted.
 Finally, as described above under DOCK-AND-LOCK® platform technology, we are developing an investigational T-cell redirected bispecific antibody that takes advantage of our Trop-2 antibody targeting, and has shown biological activity in our preclinical animal studies. We have now begun work to develop the constructs needed for translation into candidates for human clinical trials.
 Diagnostic Imaging Products
 We transitioned away from the development and commercialization of new diagnostic imaging products in order to accelerate the development of our therapeutic product candidates, although we continue to manufacture and sell, distribute and support LeukoScan® (sulesomab) in territories where regulatory approvals have previously been granted. LeukoScan® is indicated for diagnostic imaging to determine the location and extent of infection/inflammation in bone in patients with suspected osteomyelitis, including patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Research and Development Expense
 We have historically invested heavily in our research and development programs, spending approximately $51.8 million, $53.5 million and $41.7 million for these programs during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The expense decrease during the 2017 fiscal year resulted primarily from the closure of the Phase 3 pancreatic cancer “PANCRIT Trial” in the 2016 fiscal year, partially offset by higher spending in product development expense related to the manufacturing IMMU-132. The expense increases during the 2016 and 2015 fiscal years resulted primarily from higher spending for clinical trials, particularly for the PANCRIT Trial and the ADC clinical trials.

 Patents and Proprietary Rights
 Our Patents 
 We have accumulated a sizeable portfolio of patents and patent applications in the course of our research, which we believe constitutes a valuable business asset. Our key patents relate primarily to our therapeutic product candidates as well as our technologies and other discoveries for which no product candidate has yet been identified. As of August 4, 2017, our portfolio included approximately 316 active United States patents. In addition, as of such date, the portfolio included more than 400 foreign patents, with a number of United States and foreign patent applications pending.
 The chart below highlights our material patents and product groups as of August 4, 2017, the major jurisdictions, and relevant expiration periods.

  Our Licenses 
 We have obtained licenses from various parties for rights to use, develop and commercialize proprietary technologies and compounds. Currently, we have the following licenses:
 Medical Research Council (“MRC”) – We entered into a license agreement with MRC in May 1994, whereby we have obtained a license for certain patent rights with respect to the genetic engineering on monoclonal antibodies. Our agreement does not require any milestone payments, nor have we made any payments to MRC to date. Our agreement with MRC, which expires at the expiration of the last of the licensed patents in 2020, provides for future royalty payments to be made based on a percentage of product sales. 
 Center for Molecular Medicine and Immunology (“CMMI”) – We entered into a license agreement with CMMI in December 2004, whereby we have licensed certain rights with respect to patents and patent applications owned by CMMI. Dr. Goldenberg, our Chief Scientific Officer and Chief Patent Officer and former Chairman of our Board of Directors, founded and was the President and member of the Board of Trustees of CMMI. No license or milestone payments are required under this agreement. Under the license agreement, which expires at the expiration of the last of the licensed patents in 2031, CMMI will receive future royalty payments in the low single digits based on a percentage of sales of products that are derived from the CMMI patents. Inventions made independently of us by CMMI are the property of CMMI. CMMI has ceased operations and is in the process of dissolution. Please see the section entitled “Other Collaborations” for a description of the current status of the relationship.
 Our Trademarks
 The mark “IMMUNOMEDICS” is registered in the United States and 19 foreign countries and a European Community Trademark has been granted. Our logo is also registered in the United States and in one foreign country. The mark “IMMUSTRIP” is registered in the United States and Canada. The mark “LEUKOSCAN” is registered in the 

 
  13

United States and eight foreign countries, and a European Community Trademark has been granted. In addition, we have applied for registration in the United States for several other trademarks for use on products now in development or testing, and for corresponding foreign and/or European Community Trademarks for certain of those marks. The marks “EPRATUCYN,” “VELTUCYN,” “CLIVATUCYN” and “MILATUCYN” have been registered in the U.S. International Trademark Registrations and Canadian applications which claim priority to the respective United States applications have been filed for “EPRATUCYN” and “VELTUCYN.” The International Registrations request registration in China, Japan and the European Union. The marks “DOCK-AND-LOCK,” “DNL,” and “PANCRIT” have been registered in the United States.
 Our Trade Secrets
 We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets, and there is no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that such rights can be meaningfully protected. We require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisers to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreement provides that all inventions conceived by such employees shall be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. Third Party Rights
 Our success also depends in part on our ability to gain access to third party patent and proprietary rights and to operate our business without infringing on third party patent rights. We may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from third parties to develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates. Licenses required under third-party patents or proprietary rights may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not obtain the required licenses, we could encounter delays in product development while we attempt to redesign products or methods or we could be unable to develop, manufacture or sell products requiring these licenses at all.  Corporate Collaboration
 In January 2013, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Algeta ASA, subsequently acquired by Bayer, for the development of epratuzumab conjugated with Algeta’s proprietary thorium-227 alpha-pharmaceutical payload. Under the terms of this agreement, we have manufactured and supplied clinical-grade epratuzumab to Bayer, which has rights to evaluate the potential of a conjugated thorium-227 epratuzumab for the treatment of cancer. Bayer will fund all nonclinical and clinical development costs up to the end of Phase 1 clinical testing. Upon successful completion of Phase 1 clinical testing, the parties shall negotiate terms for a license agreement at Bayer’s request. We have agreed with Bayer to certain parameters to be included in the license agreement. This agreement has been extended to December 30, 2018. Other Collaborations
 In previous years, we conducted research on a number of our programs in collaboration with CMMI and its clinical unit, the Garden State Cancer Center. CMMI performed contracted pilot and pre-clinical trials in scientific areas of importance to us and also conducted basic research and pre-clinical evaluations in a number of areas of potential interest to us. Dr. David M. Goldenberg, our Chief Scientific Officer, Chief Patent Officer and former Chairman of our Board of Directors, was the President and a Member of the Board of Trustees of CMMI. CMMI has ceased operations and is in the process of dissolution.
 We also collaborate with numerous other academic and research centers. Our academic collaborators have included such institutions as the Erasme University Hospital, Brussels, Belgium; University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Nantes, France; University Medical Center Göttingen, Germany; Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; New York Presbyterian Hospital – Weill Cornell Medical College; University of Ohio Cancer Center; University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. We believe such academic research collaboration may identify new and improved products and techniques for diagnosing and treating various cancers, autoimmune and infectious diseases.

 Government Regulation 
 Regulatory Compliance 
 Our research and development activities, including testing in laboratory animals and in humans, our manufacture of antibodies, as well as the design, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, handling, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion and marketing of the product candidates that we are developing and our marketed products, are all subject to stringent regulation, primarily by the FDA in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), and its implementing regulations, and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), and its implementing regulations, and by comparable authorities under similar laws and regulations in other countries. If for any reason we do not comply with applicable requirements, such noncompliance can result in various adverse consequences, including one or more delays in approval of, or even the refusal to approve, product licenses or other applications, the suspension or termination of clinical investigations, the revocation of approvals previously granted, as well as fines, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure of products, injunctions against shipping products and total or partial suspension of production and/or refusal to allow us to enter into governmental supply contracts.  Product Approval 
 In the United States, our product candidates are regulated as biologic pharmaceuticals, or biologics. The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), the ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is initiated.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic, and the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA, for a new biologic, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”), regulations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of a BLA for a new biologic, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Preclinical tests assess the potential safety and efficacy of a product candidate in animal models. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices (“cGCPs”), which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s IRB before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.

 
  15


 The clinical investigation of a pharmaceutical, including a biologic, is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. 

· | Phase 1 studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2 includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational product for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3 clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA may place clinical trials on hold at any point in this process if, among other reasons, it concludes that clinical subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Trials may also be terminated by IRBs, which must review and approve all research involving human subjects. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing authorization. 
 The results of the preclinical and clinical testing, along with information regarding the manufacturing of the product and proposed product labeling, are evaluated and, if determined appropriate, submitted to the FDA through a BLA. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Once the BLA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s standard goal is to review applications within ten months of the filing date or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from the filing date. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA offers certain programs, such as Fast Track designation, designed to expedite the development and review of applications for products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. If Fast Track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a BLA before the application is complete, and the product may be eligible for accelerated approval. However, receipt of Fast Track designation for a product candidate does not ensure that a product will be developed or approved on an expedited basis, and such designation may be rescinded if the product candidate is found to no longer meet the qualifying criteria.  
 The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, which includes determining whether it is effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP, to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.
 After the FDA evaluates the BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, 

 
  16

among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”) created an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biologic products. The abbreviated pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on its similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. In March 2015, the FDA approved Novartis’s Zarxio as a biosimilar product to Amgen’s Neupogen. The approval, the first biosimilar product approved for distribution in the United States, could usher in lower prices for biologic products from increased competition. 
 Expedited Review and Approval    The FDA has four program designations — Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval, and Priority Review — to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. The Fast Track designation provides pharmaceutical manufacturers with opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA reviewers during the product’s development and the ability for the manufacturer to do a rolling submission of the BLA. A rolling submission allows completed portions of the application to be submitted and reviewed by the FDA on an ongoing basis. The Breakthrough Therapy designation provides manufacturers with all of the features of the Fast Track designation as well as intensive guidance on implementing an efficient development program for the product and a commitment by the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in the review. The Accelerated Approval designation allows the FDA to approve a product based on an effect on a surrogate or intermediate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a product’s clinical benefit and generally requires the manufacturer to conduct required post-approval confirmatory trials to verify the clinical benefit. The Priority Review designation means that the FDA’s goal is to take action on the BLA within six months, compared to ten months under standard review. In February 2016, sacituzumab govitecan was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for the treatment of patients with TNBC who have failed at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us or on our behalf pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies, including requirements for record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences with the biologic, submitting biological product deviation reports to notify the FDA of unanticipated changes in distributed products, establishment registration, compliance with cGMP standards (including investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP), and certain state chain of distribution pedigree requirements. Additionally, any significant change in the approved product or in how it is manufactured, including changes in formulation or the site of manufacture, generally require prior FDA approval. The packaging and labeling of all products developed by us are also subject to FDA approval and ongoing regulation. Noncompliance with any regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, issuance of warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures, and injunctive action. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 Orphan Drug Act
 To date, we have successfully obtained Orphan Drug designation by the FDA under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 for epratuzumab for NHL, yttrium-90-labeled clivatuzumab tetraxetan for pancreatic cancer, sacituzumab govitecan for SCLC and pancreatic cancer, labetuzumab for ovarian, pancreatic and SCLCs, milatuzumab for multiple myeloma and CLL, and veltuzumab for ITP and pemphigus. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers.  Orphan drug 

 
  17

designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer of the approved product cannot assure sufficient quantities. As a result, there can be no assurance that our competitors will not receive approval of drugs or biologics that have a different active ingredient for treatment of the diseases for which our products and product candidates are targeted.
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates being developed, and products being marketed outside of the United States. We must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of our products in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required by the FDA for BLA licensure. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, we are subject to post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacturing, marketing, or distribution. Other Regulatory Considerations 
 We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, The Clean Air Act, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and other current and potential future federal, state, or local regulations. Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. We believe that our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated.
 We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our products and product candidates, if approved. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy, and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies, based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the United States government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the United States, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the 

 
  18

government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating compliance of healthcare providers and manufacturers with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. Under this act, it is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. 
 Pricing Controls
 The levels of revenues and profitability of biopharmaceutical companies may be affected by the continuing efforts of government and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing reimbursement or profitability of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. In the U. S., there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing control. While we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability. Third Party Coverage and Reimbursement
 In addition, in the United States and elsewhere, sales of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payers such as government and private insurance plans. Third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. We cannot assure you that any of our products will be considered cost effective and that reimbursement to the consumer will be available or will be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. Competition 
 Competition in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense and based significantly on scientific and technological factors such as the availability of patent and other protection for technology and products, the ability to commercialize technological developments and the ability to obtain governmental approval for testing, manufacturing and marketing. 

 
  19

We compete with specialized biopharmaceutical firms in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, as well as a growing number of large pharmaceutical companies. A number of companies, including Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Biogen Idec, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Eli Lilly, Genmab, GlaxoSmithKline, Immunogen, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Merck Serono, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, and Seattle Genetics Inc. (“Seattle Genetics”), are engaged in the development of therapeutic oncology and autoimmune products. Many of these companies have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Many major pharmaceutical companies have developed or acquired internal biotechnology capabilities or made commercial arrangements with other biopharmaceutical companies. These companies, as well as academic institutions, governmental agencies and private research organizations, also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific, technical and professional personnel and consultants. Our ability to compete successfully with other companies in the biopharmaceutical field will also depend to a considerable degree on the continuing availability of capital to us.
     Marketing, Sales and Distribution
 As noted above, we intend to bring IMMU-132 to the U.S. market on our own for patients with mTNBC. Should our efforts become successful, we will need to build a commercial operation with a sales force of approximately 50 to 100 agents anticipated. At present, we have limited marketing and sales capabilities as we focus on developing our therapeutic product candidates. However, we continue to manufacture and market LeukoScan® in certain European markets with our internal sales force and to provide technical support directly to customers. In the past, we had agreements with third parties to market and provide distribution and customer support services for LeukoScan®. However, these agreements will be terminated January 1, 2018 and we will assume responsibility to distribute and support the LeukoScan® product on our own. 
     Our European operations are headquartered in Rodermark, Germany. Our distribution agreement with Logosys Logistik GmbH to package and distribute LeukoScan® in the EU will be terminated effective December 31, 2017.
     Manufacturing
 We operate a recombinant monoclonal antibody manufacturing facility at our Morris Plains, New Jersey location. This facility is used for the production of all of our therapeutic product candidates for clinical trials, and potentially for commercial production as well.  
 For the commercial-scale manufacturing of sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) we have contracted with two outside contract manufacturing organizations to provide drug for the planned Phase 3 clinical trial and to support the commercial launch of IMMU-132 in the United States. Accordingly, we have agreements with Johnson Matthey Pharma Services of Devens, Massachusetts for the manufacture of the linker-drug payload,); and, BSP Pharmaceuticals of Latina Scalo, Italy for the conjugation of the antibody with the linker-drug and fill/finish of the IMMU-132 drug product. Presently, we have the capacity at our Morris Plains facility to manufacture sufficient quantities of the Trop-2 antibody to support the commercial launch of IMMU-132 in the U.S.. Together with our CMO partners, we have already manufactured sufficient quantities of the drug product to supply our full needs to continue the Phase 2 basket trial and also to complete the confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial of IMMU-132 as a third-line therapy for patients with mTNBC. Additionally, we are currently in discussions with other CMOs to support our longer term needs for commercial-scale antibody production. 
 We also manufacture LeukoScan® for commercial sale at our facility in Morris Plains, New Jersey. The Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products of the European Commission approved the manufacturing facility and product manufacturing processes for LeukoScan® in May 1998. We perform antibody processing and purification of all our therapeutic product candidates at this facility. We scaled-up our antibody purification and fragmentation manufacturing processes for our diagnostic imaging agent to permit us to produce commercial levels of product. We have an agreement with BAG GmbH, Lich, Germany for the final formulation, fill and finish of LeukoScan®. 
 Manufacturing Regulatory Considerations
 In addition to regulating and auditing human clinical trials, the FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing of such products prior to providing approval to market a product. If, after receiving clearance from the FDA, a material change is made in manufacturing equipment, location, or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We must also adhere to cGMP and product-specific regulations enforced 

 
  20

by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that our equipment, facilities or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations.
 LeukoScan® is derived from the fluids produced in mice. Regulatory authorities, particularly in Europe, have expressed concerns about the use of these fluids for the production of monoclonal antibodies. These regulatory authorities may determine that our quality control procedures for these products are inadequate. In the event we have to discontinue the use of mouse fluids, we may not have the resources at the time to acquire the necessary manufacturing equipment and expertise that we will need to make the changes in our development programs. 
 Employees
 As of August 1, 2017, we employed 138 persons on a full-time basis, 12 of whom were in research and development departments, 22 of whom were engaged in clinical research and regulatory affairs, 79 of whom were engaged in operations and manufacturing and quality control, and 25 of whom were engaged in finance, administration, sales and marketing. Of these employees, 49 hold M.D., Ph.D. or other advanced degrees. We believe that while we have been successful to date in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel, competition for such personnel continues to be intense and there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to attract and retain the professionals we will need to grow our business. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent.  Corporate Information

 Item 1A.RISK FACTORS
 Factors That May Affect Our Business and Results of Operations
 Our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Risks Relating to Our Business, Operations and Product Development  
 We have a long history of operating losses and it is likely that our operating expenses will continue to exceed our revenues for the foreseeable future.
 We have incurred significant operating losses since our formation in 1982. As of June 30, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $521.7 million. We continue to spend our cash resources to fund our research and development programs and, subject to adequate funding, we expect these expenses to increase for the foreseeable future. Our only significant sources of revenue in recent years have been derived from our collaboration agreement with Bayer and sales of our LeukoScan® product in certain European countries. There can be no assurance that we will be profitable in future quarters or other periods. Additionally, the only product sales we have earned to date have come from the limited sales of our diagnostic imaging product for which our patent protection has expired (which may leave us vulnerable to increased competition, for example, from biosimilar manufacturers). In addition, we have made the strategic decision to de-emphasize sales of our diagnostic product and focus on our therapeutic pipeline. We have never had product sales of any therapeutic product. Although we may have net income from time to time based on the timing and amount of proceeds received under collaborative or licensing agreements, we expect to experience significant operating losses as we invest further in our research and development activities while simultaneously attempting to develop and commercialize our other therapeutic product candidates. If we are unable to develop commercially viable therapeutic products or to license them to third parties, it is likely that we will never achieve significant revenues or become profitable, either of which would jeopardize our ability to continue as a going concern.
 We have significant future capital needs and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which could force us to delay or reduce our clinical development efforts. 
 As of June 30, 2017 we have $154.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; which we believe is sufficient to support operations through September 2018, and which allows us to accomplish the goal of filing a BLA for Accelerated Approval of IMMU-132 in mTNBC from the FDA during the period between December 2017 and March 2018, subject to FDA input on the acceptance of the Company’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls filing plan.
 The Company will require additional funding after September 2018 to secure regulatory approval from the FDA, complete commercial preparations to market IMMU-132 to mTNBC patients in the United States, complete its clinical trials currently planned or underway, continue research and new development programs, and continue operations. Potential sources of funding include the exercise of outstanding warrants, potential various strategic partnership transactions towards advancing and maximizing the Company’s full pipeline for mTNBC and beyond, and equity and potential debt financing.
 Until the Company can generate significant cash through the exercise of outstanding warrants, various strategic partnership transactions towards advancing and maximizing the Company’s full pipeline for mTNBC and beyond, or commercial operations, it expects to continue to fund its operations with its current financial resources. These financial resources are adequate to sustain the Company’s operations at a level of activity sufficient to support the filing of the BLA with the FDA for accelerated approval of IMMU-132 for patients with mTNBC; to continue manufacturing IMMU-132 at large scale; to prepare for commercial operations in the U.S. marketplace; to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of IMMU-132 for mTNBC patients to support the filing of the BLA; to initiate preparations to market IMMU-132 to mTNBC patients in the U.S. and, subject to meeting all standards, completing review and final determination of the FDA, to secure accelerated regulatory approval to market IMMU-132 for the use of patients with mTNBC in the U.S.. After September 2018, if the Company cannot obtain sufficient funding through the exercise of outstanding warrants, 

 
  22

various potential strategic partnership transactions towards advancing and maximizing the Company’s full pipeline for mTNBC and beyond, it could be required to finance future cash needs through the sale of additional equity and/or debt securities in capital markets. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the additional capital needed to complete its pipeline of research and development programs on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. The capital markets have experienced volatility in recent years, which has resulted in uncertainty with respect to availability of capital and hence the timing to meet an entity’s liquidity needs. The Company’s existing debt may also negatively impact the Company’s ability to raise additional capital. If the Company is unable to raise capital on acceptable terms, its ability to continue its business would be materially and adversely affected.
 Our most advanced therapeutic product candidates are still only in the clinical development stage, and will require us to raise capital in the future in order to fund further expensive and time-consuming studies before they can even be submitted for final regulatory approval. A failure of a clinical trial could severely harm our business and results of operations.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of a product candidate to patients who are already extremely ill, making patient enrollment often difficult and expensive. Moreover, even in ideal circumstances where the patients can be enrolled and then followed for the several months or more required to complete the study, the trials can be suspended, terminated, delayed or otherwise fail for any number of reasons, including:

· | later-stage clinical trials may raise safety or efficacy concerns not readily apparent in earlier trials or fail to meet the primary endpoint;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | unforeseen difficulties in manufacturing the product candidate in compliance with all regulatory requirements and in the quantities needed to complete the trial which may become cost-prohibitive;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we or our collaboration partner may experience delays in obtaining, or be unable to obtain, agreement for the conduct of our clinical trials from the FDA, IRBs, or other reviewing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | while underway, the continuation of clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or terminated due to modifications to the clinical trial’s protocols based on interim results obtained or changes required or conditions imposed by the FDA, an IRB, a data and safety monitoring board (“DSMB”), or any other regulatory authority;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our third-party contractors may fail to meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the FDA or other regulatory authorities may impose a clinical hold, for example based an inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we or our collaboration partner may suspend or cease trials in our or their sole discretion;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | during the long trial process alternative therapies may become available which make further development of the product candidate impracticable; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | if we are unable to obtain the additional capital we need to fund all of the clinical trials we foresee, we may be forced to cancel or otherwise curtail such trials and other studies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Any substantial delay in successfully completing clinical trials for our product candidates, sacituzumab govitecan and labetuzumab govitecan, could severely harm our business and results of operations.
 Moreover, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA. The FDA may conclude that a financial relationship between the company and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the study. The FDA may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA and may ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of one or more of our product candidates.

 
  23


 Our clinical trials may not adequately show that our drugs are safe or effective, and a failure to achieve the planned endpoints could result in termination of product development.
 Progression of our drug products through the clinical development process is dependent upon our trials indicating our drugs have adequate safety and efficacy in the patients being treated by achieving pre-determined safety and efficacy endpoints according to the trial protocols. Failure to achieve either of these endpoints could result in delays in our trials; require the performance of additional unplanned trials or termination of any further development of the product for the intended indication. 
 These factors could result in delays in the development of our product candidates and could result in significant unexpected costs or the termination of programs.
 Should the clinical development process be successfully completed, our ability to derive revenues from the sale of therapeutics will depend upon our first obtaining FDA as well as foreign regulatory approvals, all of which are subject to a number of unique risks and uncertainties.
 Even if we are able to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in clinical trials, if we fail to gain timely approval to commercialize our product candidates from the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities, we will be unable to generate the revenues we will need to build our business. These approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all, and even if and when they are granted, they may not cover all the indications for which we seek approval. For example, while we may develop a product candidate with the intention of addressing a large, unmet medical need, the FDA may only approve the use of the drug for indications affecting a relatively small number of patients, thus greatly reducing the market size and our potential revenues. The approvals may also contain significant limitations in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications with respect to conditions of use, which could further narrow the size of the market. In certain countries, even if the health regulatory authorities approve a drug, it cannot be marketed until pricing for the drug is also approved. Finally, even after approval can be obtained, we may be required to recall or withdraw a product as a result of newly discovered safety or efficacy concerns, either of which would have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 In order to fund future operations, we will need to raise significant amounts of additional capital. Because it can be difficult for a small-cap company like ours to raise equity capital on acceptable terms, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary capital when we need it, or on acceptable terms, if at all.
 Even if our technologies and product candidates are superior, if we lack the capital needed to bring our future products to market, we will never be successful. We have obtained the capital necessary to fund our research and development programs to date primarily from the following sources:

· | upfront payments, milestone payments, and payments for limited amounts of our antibodies received from licensing partners;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | proceeds from the public and private sale of our equity or debt securities; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | limited product sales of LeukoScan®, licenses, grants and interest income from our investments
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Over the long term, we expect to commercialize IMMU-132 in mTNBC in the U.S. and globally, to expand IMMU-132 to treat patients with other solid tumors, including urinary bladder cancer, small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others serious cancers, to expand research and development activities to continue to expand and we do not believe we will have adequate cash to continue commercial expansion and development of IMMU-132,  or to complete development of product candidates in line with our pipeline included in our long term corporate strategy. Our capital requirements are dependent on numerous factors, including:

· | the rate of progress of commercialization of IMMU-132 in mTNBC and develop it for other cancers
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the rate at which we progress our research programs and the number of product candidates we have in pre-clinical and clinical development at any one time;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the cost of conducting clinical trials involving patients in the United States, Europe and possibly elsewhere;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  24



· | our need to establish the manufacturing capabilities necessary to produce the quantities of our product candidates we project we will need;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the time and costs involved in obtaining FDA and foreign regulatory approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the cost of first obtaining, and then defending, our patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the ability and willingness of the holders of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (“Convertible Senior Notes”) to convert their Convertible Senior Notes to Immunomedics common stock; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ability to enter into licensing and other collaborative agreements to help offset some of these costs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There may be additional cash requirements for many reasons, including, but not limited to, changes in our commercial expansion plans, our research and development plans, the need for unexpected capital expenditures or costs associated with any acquisitions of other businesses, assets or technologies that we may choose to undertake and marketing and commercialization of our product candidates. If we deplete our existing capital resources, we will be required to either obtain additional capital quickly, or significantly reduce our operating expenses and capital expenditures, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Until we can generate significant cash through the exercise of outstanding warrants, various strategic partnership transactions towards advancing and maximizing the Company’s full pipeline for mTNBC and beyond, we expect to continue to fund our operations with our current financial resources. These financial resources will not be adequate to sustain our operations beyond the third quarter 2018. Consequently, if we cannot obtain sufficient funding through the exercise of outstanding warrants, various strategic partnership transactions towards advancing and maximizing the Company’s full pipeline for mTNBC and beyond, we could be required to finance future cash needs through the sale of additional equity and/or debt securities in capital markets. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the additional capital needed to complete our pipeline of research and development programs on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. The capital markets have experienced volatility in recent years, which has resulted in uncertainty with respect to availability of capital and hence the timing to meet an entity’s liquidity needs. The Company’s existing debt will also negatively impact the Company’s ability to raise additional capital. If the Company is unable to raise capital on acceptable terms, its ability to continue its business would be materially and adversely affected. Having insufficient funds may require us to delay, scale-back, or eliminate some or all of our programs, or renegotiate less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose. Failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern. 
 Additionally, if we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders would result; and if we raise funds by incurring additional debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve future cash payment obligations and/or conversion to equity as well as restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.
 If we, or our collaboration partner, cannot successfully and efficiently manufacture the compounds that make up our products and product candidates, our ability, and the ability of our collaboration partner, to sell products and conduct clinical trials will be impaired.
 Our ability to conduct our pre-clinical and clinical research and development programs depends, in large part, upon our ability to manufacture our proprietary compounds in accordance with the FDA and other regulatory requirements. We have limited historical experience in manufacturing these compounds in significant quantities, and we may not be able to do so in the quantities required to commercialize these products. Any interruption in manufacturing at this site, whether by natural acts or otherwise, could significantly and adversely affect our operations, and delay our research and development programs.
 We and our collaboration partner also depend on third parties to provide certain raw materials, manufacturing and processing services. All manufacturers of pharmaceutical products must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations or cGMPs, required by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Such regulations address, among other matters, controls in manufacturing processes, quality control and quality assurance requirements and the maintenance of proper records and documentation. The FDA and other regulatory agencies routinely inspect manufacturing facilities. The FDA generally will issue a notice on Form 483 if it finds issues with respect to its inspections. If our manufacturing facility or those facilities of our partner and our respective contract manufacturers or processors do not comply with applicable cGMPs and other regulatory requirements, we may be subject to product 

 
  25

liability claims, we may be unable to meet clinical demand for our products, and we could suffer delays in the progress of clinical trials for products under development.
 Although historically we have been a research and development company, we plan to commercialize our lead product candidate internally rather than license such asset. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and expanding commercial operations or balancing our research and development activities with our commercialization activities. 
 We have historically been engaged primarily in research and development activities, but plan to commercialize our lead product candidate, IMMU-132, ourselves. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the balance of our research and development operations with our planned commercialization activities. Potential investors should be aware of the problems, delays, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies balancing development of product candidates, which can include problems such as unanticipated issues relating to clinical trials and receipt of approvals from the FDA and foreign regulatory bodies, with commercialization efforts, which can include problems relating to managing manufacturing and supply, reimbursement, marketing problems and additional costs. Our product candidates will require significant additional research and clinical trials, and we will need to overcome significant regulatory burdens prior to commercialization in the U.S. and other countries. In addition, we may be required to spend significant funds on building out our commercial operations. There can be no assurance that after the expenditure of substantial funds and efforts, we will successfully develop and commercialize any of our product candidates, generate any significant revenues or ever achieve and maintain a substantial level of sales of our products.
 We may not successfully establish and maintain collaborative and licensing arrangements, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize certain of our product candidates. Our future collaboration partners may not adequately perform their responsibilities under our agreement, which could adversely affect our development and commercialization program.
 A key element of our business strategy has been to develop, market and commercialize our product candidates through collaborations with more established pharmaceutical companies. To the extent we continue to rely on this business strategy, we may not be able to maintain or expand these licenses and collaborations or establish additional licensing and collaboration arrangements necessary to develop and commercialize any of our product candidates. Even if we are able to maintain or establish licensing or collaboration arrangements, these arrangements may not be on favorable terms and may contain provisions that will restrict our ability to develop, test and market our product candidates. Any failure to maintain or establish licensing or collaboration arrangements on favorable terms could adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition or ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.
 We expect to rely at least in part on third party collaborators to perform a number of activities relating to the development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates, including the manufacturing of product materials, the design and conduct of clinical trials for certain of our product candidates, and potentially the obtaining of regulatory approvals and marketing and distribution of any successfully developed products. Our collaborative partners may also have or acquire rights to control aspects of our product development and clinical programs. As a result, we may not be able to conduct these programs in the manner or on the time schedule we currently contemplate. In addition, if any of these collaborative partners withdraw support for our programs or product candidates or otherwise impair their development, our business could be negatively affected. Our expenses may also increase as a result of our plan to undertake these activities internally to commercialize IMMU-132.
 In addition, our success depends on the performance of our collaborators of their responsibilities under these arrangements. Some potential collaborators may not perform their obligations in a timely fashion or in a manner satisfactory to us. Because such agreements may be exclusive, we may not be able to enter into a collaboration agreement with any other company covering the same product field during the applicable collaborative period. In addition, our collaborators’ competitors may not wish to do business with us at all due to our relationship with our collaborators. If we are unable to enter into additional product discovery and development collaborations, our ability to sustain or expand our business will be significantly diminished.

 
  26


 Our future success will depend upon our ability to first obtain and then adequately protect our patent and other intellectual property rights, as well as avoiding the infringement of the rights of others.
 Our future success will be highly dependent upon our ability to first obtain and then defend the patent and other intellectual property rights necessary for the commercialization of our product candidates. We have filed numerous patent applications on the technologies and processes that we use in the United States and certain foreign countries. Although we have obtained a number of issued U.S. patents to date, the patent applications owned or licensed by us may not result in additional patents being issued. Moreover, these patents may not afford us the protection we need against competitors with similar technologies or products. A number of jurisdictions where we have sought, or may in future choose to seek, intellectual property protection, have intellectual property laws and patent offices which are still developing. Accordingly, we may have difficulty obtaining intellectual property protection in these markets, and any intellectual property protections which we do obtain may be less protective than in the United States, which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial prospects.
 The successful development of therapeutic products frequently requires the application of multiple technologies that may be subject to the patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Although we believe it is likely we will need to license technologies and processes from third parties in the ordinary course of our business, we are not currently aware of any material conflict involving our technologies and processes with any valid patents or other intellectual property rights owned or licensed by others. In the event that a third party was to claim such a conflict existed, they could sue us for damages as well as seek to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates. It is possible that a third party could successfully claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. Uncertainties resulting from the litigation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, would require significant financial resources and management time. 
 Some of our competitors may be able to sustain these costs more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial and managerial resources. If a patent litigation or other proceeding is resolved unfavorably to us, we may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling our products without a license from the other party, in addition to being held liable for significant damages. We may not be able to obtain any such license on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
 In addition to our reliance on patents, we attempt to protect our proprietary technologies and processes by relying on trade secret laws, nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements with our employees and other persons who have access to our proprietary information. These agreements and arrangements may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary technologies and processes in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. In addition, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent technologies and processes or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or technology, either of which could materially and adversely affect our competitive position.
 Expiry of our intellectual property rights could lead to increased competition
 Even where we are able to obtain and then defend patent and other intellectual property rights necessary for research, development and commercialization of our product candidates, such intellectual property rights will be for a limited term. Where patents which we own or license expire, the technology the subject of the patent may be utilized by third parties in research and development or competing products (for example, biosimilars of a patented product may be manufactured by third parties once the patent expires). While we endeavor to maintain robust intellectual property protection, as our existing issued patents expire it may materially and adversely affect our competitive position.
 We face substantial competition in the biotechnology industry and may not be able to compete successfully against one or more of our competitors.
 The biotechnology industry is highly competitive, particularly in the area of diagnostic and therapeutic oncology and autoimmune disease products. In recent years, there have been extensive technological innovations achieved in short periods of time, and it is possible that future technological changes and discoveries by others could 

 
  27

result in our products and product candidates quickly becoming uncompetitive or obsolete. A number of companies, including Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Biogen Idec, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Eli Lilly, Genmab, GlaxoSmithKline, Immunogen, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Merck Serono, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, and Seattle Genetics, are engaged in the development of therapeutic oncology products. Many of these companies have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In addition, many of these companies have more established positions in the pharmaceutical industry and are therefore better equipped to develop, commercialize and market oncology and autoimmune disease products. Even some smaller competitors may obtain a significant competitive advantage over us if they are able to discover or otherwise acquire patentable inventions, form collaborative arrangements or merge with larger pharmaceutical companies. Further, even if we are able to successfully develop and commercialize products, other manufacturers operating in emerging markets may also have a competitive advantage over us with respect to competing products due to their ability to manufacture with a lower cost base.
 We expect to face increasing competition from universities and other non-profit research organizations. These institutions carry out a significant amount of research and development in the field of antibody-based technologies and they are increasingly aware of the commercial value of their findings. As a result, they are demanding greater patent and other proprietary rights, as well as licensing and future royalty revenues. It is possible that such competition could come from universities with which we have, or have previously had, collaborative research and development relationships, notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property in the course of such relationships.
 We may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials that we use in the operations of our business.
 In addition to laws and regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to regulation under various other foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations. Our manufacturing and research and development programs involve the controlled use of viruses, hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials can never be completely eliminated, and if an accident occurs we could be held liable for any damages that result, which could exceed our available resources.
 The nature of our business exposes us to significant liability claims, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover any future claims.
 The use of our compounds in clinical trials and any future sale exposes us to liability claims that could be substantial. These claims might be made directly by healthcare providers, medical personnel, patients, consumers, pharmaceutical companies, and others selling or distributing our compounds. While we currently have product liability insurance that we consider adequate for our current needs, we may not be able to continue to obtain comparable insurance in the future at an acceptable cost, if at all. If for any reason we cannot maintain our existing or comparable liability insurance, our ability to clinically test and market products could be significantly impaired. Moreover, the amount and scope of our insurance coverage, as well as the indemnification arrangements with third parties upon which we rely, may be inadequate to protect us in the event of a successful product liability claim. Any successful claim in excess of our insurance coverage could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
 Certain potential for conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, exist which could result in expensive and time-consuming litigation.
 Certain members of our senior management and Board of Directors have relationships and agreements, both with us as well as among themselves and their respective affiliates, which create the potential for both real, as well as perceived, conflicts of interest. These include Dr. David M. Goldenberg, a director and our Chief Scientific Officer and Chief Patent Officer, who was the former Chairman of our Board of Directors, Ms. Cynthia L. Sullivan, a director and our former President and Chief Executive Officer (who is also the wife of Dr. Goldenberg), and certain companies with which we do business, including the Center for Molecular Medicine and Immunology and the Garden State Cancer Center (which operated as the clinical arm of CMMI to facilitate the translation of CMMI’s research efforts in the treatment of patients), collectively defined as CMMI. For example, Dr. Goldenberg was the President and a Trustee of CMMI, a not-for-profit cancer research center that we used to conduct certain research activities. CMMI has ceased operations. Dr. Goldenberg is also a minority stockholder, director and officer of our majority-owned subsidiary, IBC. 

 
  28

Dr. Goldenberg is the primary inventor of new intellectual property for Immunomedics and IBC and is largely responsible for allocating ownership between the two companies. Immunomedics has incurred expenses on behalf of the IBC operations, including interest, over the past thirteen years. As of June 30, 2017, IBC has a liability to Immunomedics Inc. of approximately $16.8 million, which is eliminated in consolidation. Dr. Goldenberg also has primary responsibility for monitoring the market for incidences of potential infringement of the Company’s intellectual property by third parties.
 As a result of these and other relationships, the potential for both real and perceived conflicts of interest exists and disputes could arise over the allocation of funds, research projects and ownership of intellectual property rights. In addition, in the event that we become involved in stockholder litigation regarding these potential conflicts, we might be required to devote significant resources and management time defending the company from these claims, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
 Given that recent cancer therapeutics for solid cancers such as the ones we are developing can cost approximately in excess of $12,500 a month, even if our product candidates become available for sale it is likely that federal and state governments, insurance companies and other payers of health care costs will try to first limit the use of these drugs to certain patients, and may be reluctant to provide a level of reimbursement that permits us to earn a significant profit on our investment, if any.
 Our ability to successfully commercialize therapeutic products will depend, in significant part, on the extent to which hospitals and physicians can obtain appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our products and related treatment. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for diagnostic and therapeutic products and related services. In addition, legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs may result in lower prices or the actual inability of prospective customers to purchase our products. Furthermore, even if reimbursement is available, it may not be available at price levels sufficient for us to realize a positive return on our investment.
 A portion of our funding has come from federal government grants and research contracts. Due to reductions in funding, we may not be able to rely on these grants or contracts as a continuing source of funds.
 During the last few years, we have generated revenues from awards made to us by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense to partially fund some of our programs. We cannot rely on grants or additional contracts as a continuing source of funds. Funds available under these grants and contracts must be applied by us toward the research and development programs specified by the government rather than for all our programs generally. The government’s obligation to make payments under these grants and contracts is subject to appropriation by the United States Congress for funding in each year. It is possible that Congress or the government agencies that administer these government research programs will continue to scale back these programs or terminate them due to their own budgetary constraints, as they have recently been doing. Additionally, these grants and research contracts are subject to adjustment based upon the results of periodic audits performed on behalf of the granting authority. Consequently, the government may not award grants or research contracts to us in the future, and any amounts that we derive from existing awards may be less than those received to date. In those circumstances, we would need to provide funding on our own, obtain other funding, or scale back or terminate the affected program. In particular, we cannot assure you that any currently-contemplated or future efforts to obtain funding for our product candidate programs through government grants or contracts will be successful, or that any such arrangements which we do conclude will supply us with sufficient funds to complete our development programs without providing additional funding on our own or obtaining other funding. Where funding is obtained from government agencies or research bodies, our intellectual property rights in the research or technology funded by the grant are typically subject to certain licenses to such agencies or bodies, which could have an impact on our utilization of such intellectual property in future.
 We face a number of risks relating to the maintenance of our information systems and our use of information relating to clinical trials.
 In managing our operations, we rely on computer systems and electronic communications, including systems relating to record keeping, financial information, sourcing, and back-up and the internet (“Information Systems”). Our 

 
  29

Information Systems include the electronic storage of financial, operational, research, patient and other data. Our Information Systems may be subject to interruption or damage from a variety of causes, including power outages, computer and communications failures, system capacity constraints, catastrophic events (such as fires, tornadoes and other natural disasters), cyber risks, computer viruses and security breaches. If our Information Systems cease to function properly, are damaged or are subject to unauthorized access, we may suffer interruptions in our operations, be required to make significant investments to fix or replace systems and/or be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits, or government action. The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our clinical trials information and patient data (which may include personally identifiable information) is part of our Information Systems and is therefore subject to all of the risks set forth above, notwithstanding our efforts to code and protect such information.
 Risks Related to Government Regulation of our Industry
 Legislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell our products profitably. 
 In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our future products and profitability. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, “PPACA”), which includes a number of health care reform provisions and requires most United States citizens to have health insurance. The new law, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and establishes a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been added, which may require modification of business practices with health care practitioners.
 In the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our future products, and we could be adversely affected by current and future health care reforms. 
 Our industry and we are subject to intense regulation from the United States Government and such other governments and quasi-official regulatory bodies where our products are and product candidates may be sold.
 Both before and after regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, including our biologic product candidates, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, distribution and record keeping related to the product are subject to extensive, ongoing regulatory requirements, including, without limitation, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP requirements and good clinical practice requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. As a result, we are subject to a number of governmental and other regulatory risks, which include:

· | clinical development is a long, expensive and uncertain process; delay and failure can occur at any stage of our clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our clinical trials are dependent on patient enrollment and regulatory approvals; we do not know whether our planned trials will begin on time, or at all, or will be completed on schedule, or at all;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the FDA or other regulatory authorities may not approve a clinical trial protocol or may place a clinical trial on hold;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we rely on third parties, such as consultants, contract research organizations, medical institutions, and clinical investigators, to conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates and if we or any of our third-party contractors fail to
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  30


comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such as cGCP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | if the clinical development process is completed successfully, our ability to derive revenues from the sale of therapeutics will depend on our first obtaining FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory approvals, each of which are subject to unique risks and uncertainties;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | there is no assurance that we will receive FDA or corollary foreign approval for any of our product candidates for any indication; we are subject to government regulation for the commercialization of our product candidates;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we have not received regulatory approval in the United States for the commercial sale of any of our biologic product candidates;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | even if one or more of our product candidates does obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve such product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of FDA and other applicable United States and foreign regulatory authorities could subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | although several of our product candidates have received orphan drug designation in the United States and the EU for particular indications, we may not receive orphan drug exclusivity for any or all of those product candidates or indications upon approval, and even if we do obtain orphan drug exclusivity, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | even if one or more of our product candidates is approved in the United States, it may not obtain the 12 years of exclusivity from biosimilars for which innovator biologics are eligible, and even if it does obtain such exclusivity, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates, and if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials used in the operations of our business.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, our operations are also subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency and privacy and security laws, including, without limitation:

· | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs. This statute has been applied to pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  31



· | HIPAA and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Federal “sunshine” requirements imposed by PPACA on drug manufacturers regarding any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, and any ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | State and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including certain sales and marketing practices and financial arrangements with physicians, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Any action against us, even if we successfully defend against it, could result in the commencement of civil and/or criminal proceedings, exclusion from governmental health care programs, substantial fines, penalties, and/or administrative remedies, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 Risks Related to Our Securities
 Conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
 The conversion of some or all of the Convertible Senior Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion and exercise could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.  In addition, the existence of the Convertible Senior Notes may encourage short selling by market participants.
 Our indebtedness and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.
 As of June 30, 2017, our total consolidated indebtedness was $131.3 million, including our obligations under our Convertible Senior Notes and other liabilities. We intend to fulfill our current debt service obligations, including repayment of the principal from our existing cash and investments, as well as the proceeds from potential licensing agreements and any additional financing from equity or debt transactions. However, our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Convertible Senior Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow to meet these obligations, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive, or delaying or curtailing research and development programs. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We 

 
  32

may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.
 Our common stock may be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market, or NASDAQ.
 If the bid price of our common stock falls below $1.00 for an extended period, or we are unable to continue to meet NASDAQ’s listing maintenance standards for any other reason, our common stock could be delisted from NASDAQ.
 If our stock is delisted from NASDAQ, we will make every possible effort to have it listed on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (the “OTC Bulletin Board”). If our common stock was to be traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and related SEC rules would impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell our securities. These rules may adversely affect the ability of stockholders to sell our common stock and otherwise negatively affect the liquidity, trading market and price of our common stock.
 If our common stock would not be able to be traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, we would make every effort to have it available for trading on the National Quotation Bureau’s Pink Sheets (“the Pink Sheets”). The Pink Sheets market consists of security firms who act as market makers in the stocks, usually, of very small companies. The bid and asked prices are not quoted electronically, but are quoted daily in “hard copy” which is delivered to firms that subscribe. Stocks that trade in the Pink Sheets are usually not as liquid as those that trade in electronic markets and, often time, the difference between the bid and the asked prices are substantial. As a result, if our common stock were traded on the Pink Sheets, there would likely be a further negative affect on the liquidity, trading market and price of our common stock even compared to what we might suffer if we were traded on the OTC Bulletin Board.
 As a result of the above, we cannot assure you that our common stock will be listed on a national securities exchange, a national quotation service, the OTC Bulletin Board or the Pink Sheets; or if it is to be listed, whether or not there would be an interruption in the trading of our common stock. We believe that the listing of our stock on a recognized national trading market, such as NASDAQ, is an important part of our business and strategy. Such a listing helps our stockholders by providing a readily available trading market with current quotations. Without that, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our stock, the sale or purchase of our stock would likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of our stock would likely decline. The absence of such a listing may adversely affect the acceptance of our common stock as currency or the value accorded it by other parties. In that regard, listing on a recognized national trading market will also affect our ability to benefit from the use of its operations and expansion plans, including for use in licensing agreements, joint ventures, the development of strategic relationships and acquisitions, which are critical to our business and strategy and none of which is currently the subject of any agreement, arrangement or understanding, with respect to any future financing or strategic relationship it may undertake. The delisting from NASDAQ would result in negative publicity and would negatively impact our ability to raise capital in the future.
 If we were delisted from NASDAQ, we may become subject to the trading complications experienced by “Penny Stocks” in the over-the-counter market.
 Delisting from NASDAQ may depress the price of our common stock such that we may become a penny stock. The SEC generally defines a penny stock as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. We continue to be listed on NASDAQ. “Penny Stock” rules require, among other things, that any broker engaging in a purchase or sale of our securities provide its customers with: (i) a risk disclosure document; (ii) disclosure of market quotations, if any; (iii) disclosure of the compensation of the broker and its salespersons in the transaction; and (iv) monthly account statements showing the market values of our securities held in the customers’ accounts.

 
  33


 A broker would be required to provide the bid and offer quotations and compensation information before effecting the transaction. This information must be contained on the customers’ confirmation. Generally, brokers are less willing to effect transactions in penny stocks due to these additional delivery requirements. These requirements may make it more difficult for stockholders to purchase or sell our common stock. Because the broker, not us, prepares this information, we would not be able to assure that such information is accurate, complete or current.
 We may add lease lines to finance capital expenditures and may obtain additional long‑term debt and lines of credit. If we issue other debt securities in the future, our debt service obligations will increase further.
 Our indebtedness could have significant additional negative consequences, including, but not limited to:

· | requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our existing cash and marketable securities balances and, if available, future cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | limiting our ability to sell assets if deemed necessary;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We may not have the ability to raise funds necessary to purchase the Convertible Senior Notes upon a fundamental change and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes.
 Following a fundamental change (which includes matters such as a change in control of the Company, approval by the Company’s stockholders of a plan of dissolution or liquidation of the Company, and the cessation of listing of the Company’s common stock on NASDAQ or The New York Stock Exchange, among others as further described in the indenture), holders of Convertible Senior Notes will have the right to require the Company to purchase their Convertible Senior Notes for cash. A fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or require prepayment under, and result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our other then-existing indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price in cash with respect to any Convertible Senior Notes surrendered by holders for purchase upon a fundamental change. In addition, restrictions in the agreements governing our then-outstanding indebtedness, if any, may not allow us to purchase the Convertible Senior Notes upon a fundamental change. Our failure to purchase the Convertible Senior Notes upon a fundamental change when required would result in an event of default with respect to the Convertible Senior Notes which could, in turn, constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness, if any. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the Convertible Senior Notes, which could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
 Shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect our ability to sell equity securities.
 Sales of our common stock (including the issuance of shares upon conversion of convertible debt) in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of shares. We have outstanding $100 million principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes that convert to common stock at prices equivalent to $5.11 (subject to adjustment for certain dilutive events). Our obligation to convert the Convertible Senior Notes upon demand by the holders may depress the price of our common stock and also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity‑related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.
 As of June 30, 2017 we had 110,344,643 shares of common stock issued, plus (1) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock issued, which is convertible into up to approximately 23,105,348 shares of common stock at the conversion price of $5.41, (2) $100 million of principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes convertible into up to approximately 

 
  34

19,583,360 shares of common stock at the conversion rate of $5.11 subject to adjustment as described in the indenture, (3) 2,893,240 options to purchase shares of common stock with a weighted‑average exercise price of $3.48 per share, (4) 1,831,329 restricted stock units, (5) 9,540,417 for potential future grants of options to purchase shares of common stock under the Plan, (6) warrants to purchase 10,000,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $3.75 and (7) warrants to purchase 8,655,804 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $4.90. Of the 250,000,000 shares of common stock authorized under our Certificate of Incorporation, there are 64,045,859 shares of common stock that remain available for future issuance.
 Our outstanding Convertible Senior Notes, Convertible Preferred Shares, options and warrants may adversely affect our ability to consummate future equity‑based financings due to the dilution potential to future investors.
 Due to the number of shares of common stock we are obligated to issue pursuant to outstanding Convertible Senior Notes, Convertible Preferred Shares, options and warrants, potential investors may not purchase our future equity offerings at market price because of the potential dilution such investors may suffer as a result of the exercise of the outstanding Convertible Senior Notes, options and warrants.
 The market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past, and is likely to continue to fluctuate widely based on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.
 The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile. Furthermore, the stock market and the market for stocks of relatively small biopharmaceutical companies like ours have from time to time experienced, and likely will again experience, significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to actual operating performance.
 From time to time, stock market analysts publish research reports or otherwise comment upon our business and future prospects. Due to a number of factors, we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors and our stock price would likely decline as a result. These factors include:

· | Announcements by us, our current collaboration partner, any future alliance partners or our competitors of pre-clinical studies and clinical trial results, regulatory developments, technological innovations or new therapeutic products, product sales, new products or product candidates and product development timelines;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The formation or termination of corporate alliances;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | Developments in patent or other proprietary rights by us or our respective competitors, including litigation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Developments or disputes concerning our patent or other proprietary rights, and the issuance of patents in our field of business to others;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Government regulatory action;
--+------------------------------


· | Period-to-period fluctuations in the results of our operations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Developments and market conditions for emerging growth companies and biopharmaceutical companies, in general.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, Internet “chat rooms” have provided forums where investors make predictions about our business and prospects, oftentimes without any real basis in fact, that readers may trade on.
 In the past, following periods of volatility in the market prices of the securities of companies in our industry, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against those companies. Please see Item 3 (“Legal Proceedings”) for a description of such litigation. If we face such litigation in the future, it would result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could negatively impact our business. 
 Our principal stockholders can significantly influence all matters requiring the approval by our stockholders.
 As of June 30, 2017 venBio Select Advisor LLC, (‘venBio”) is the beneficial owner of approximately 11.1% of our outstanding common stock (assuming for these purposes only, the conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred 

 
  35

stock into common stock) and approximately 7.9% of our fully diluted common stock. venBio is our largest stockholder, and Dr. Behzad Aghazadeh, the Managing Partner and portfolio manager of the venBio Select Fund, serves as Chairman of our Board of Directors.
 As of June 30, 2017, Dr. David M. Goldenberg, our Chief Scientific Officer, Chief Patent Officer and former Chairman of the Board, together with certain members of his family, including Ms. Cynthia L. Sullivan, our former President and Chief Executive Officer, who is Dr. Goldenberg’s wife, and other affiliates, controlled the right to vote approximately 6.9% of our outstanding common stock and approximately 4.1% of our fully diluted common stock. 
 As a result of this voting power, venBio and Dr. Goldenberg have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of substantially all matters that may be put to a vote of our stockholders, including the election of our directors.
 There are limitations on the liability of our directors, and we may have to indemnify our officers and directors in certain instances.
 Our certificate of incorporation limits, to the maximum extent permitted under Delaware law, the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors. Our bylaws provide that we will indemnify our officers and directors and may indemnify our employees and other agents to the fullest extent permitted by law. These provisions may be in some respects broader than the specific indemnification provisions under Delaware law. The indemnification provisions may require us, among other things, to indemnify such officers and directors against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers (other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of a culpable nature), to advance their expenses incurred as a result of certain proceedings against them as to which they could be indemnified and to obtain directors’ and officers’ insurance. Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a corporation may indemnify a director, officer, employee or agent made or threatened to be made a party to an action by reason of the fact that he or she was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or was serving at the request of the corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such action if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Delaware law does not permit a corporation to eliminate a director’s duty of care and the provisions of our certificate of incorporation have no effect on the availability of equitable remedies, such as injunction or rescission, for a director’s breach of the duty of care.
 We believe that our limitation of officer and director liability assists us to attract and retain qualified employees and directors. However, in the event an officer, a director or the board of directors commits an act that may legally be indemnified under Delaware law, we will be responsible to pay for such officer(s) or director(s) legal defense and potentially any damages resulting there from. Furthermore, the limitation on director liability may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders from instituting litigation against directors for breach of their fiduciary duties, even though such an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders and us. Given the difficult environment and potential for incurring liabilities currently facing directors of publicly-held corporations, we believe that director indemnification is in our and our stockholders’ best interests because it enhances our ability to attract and retain highly qualified directors and reduce a possible deterrent to entrepreneurial decision-making.
 Nevertheless, limitations of director liability may be viewed as limiting the rights of stockholders, and the broad scope of the indemnification provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could result in increased expenses. Our board of directors believes, however, that these provisions will provide a better balancing of the legal obligations of, and protections for, directors and will contribute positively to the quality and stability of our corporate governance. Our board of directors has concluded that the benefit to stockholders of improved corporate governance outweighs any possible adverse effects on stockholders of reducing the exposure of directors to liability and broadened indemnification rights.

 We are exposed to potential risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate controls under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Among other things, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”). Compliance with Section 404 requires substantial accounting expense and significant management efforts. Our testing, or the subsequent review by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls that would require us to remediate in a timely manner so as to be able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 each year. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner each year, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the NASDAQ Stock Market or other regulatory authorities that would require additional financial and management resources and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
 We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock. Until such time as we pay cash dividends our stockholders, must rely on increases in our stock price for appreciation.
 We have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain future earnings to develop and commercialize our product candidates and therefore we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Until such time as we determine to pay cash dividends on our common stock, our stockholders must rely on increases in the market price of our common stock for appreciation of their investment.
