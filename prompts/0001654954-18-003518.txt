 Company Background
  
 MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (“We” or the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation, originally incorporated in 1988 under the name Terrapin Diagnostics, Inc. in the state of Delaware, and subsequently renamed “Telik, Inc.” in 1998, and thereafter renamed MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. in September 2014. Our principal corporate office is located at 11535 Sorrento Valley Road, Suite 400, San Diego, CA 92121 and our telephone number is (858) 259-9405. On July 8, 2014, we consummated a merger with MabVax Therapeutics, pursuant to which our subsidiary Tacoma Acquisition Corp. merged with and into MabVax Therapeutics, with MabVax Therapeutics surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary. This transaction is referred to as the “Merger.” Our internet address is www.mabvax.com. Information on our website is not incorporated into this report.
 Business Overview
  
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of antibody-based products to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of cancer.  MabVax has discovered a pipeline of human monoclonal antibody products based on the protective immune responses generated by patients who have been vaccinated against targeted cancers with our proprietary vaccines.  MabVax's lead development program is centered around our HuMab-5B1 antibody, which is fully human and discovered from the immune response of cancer patients vaccinated with an antigen-specific vaccine during a Phase I trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, or MSK.   The antigen the antibody targets is expressed on more than 90% of pancreatic cancers, and expressed in significant percentages on small cell lung cancer, stomach, colon and other cancers, making the antibody potentially broadly applicable to many types of cancers.  We have multiple antibody candidates, discovered utilizing the same methodologies that are in preclinical development.
  
 Monoclonal antibodies are produced from a single DNA sequence encoded into multiple cells that all produce the same single antibody. We generate our pipeline of antibody-based product candidates from patients who have been vaccinated with proprietary vaccines licensed from MSK. Our approach involves surveying the protective immune response from many patients who were vaccinated with the same vaccine to identify one or more optimal monoclonal antibody candidates against a specific target on the surface of a cancer cell. We believe this approach provides us with a novel next-generation human antibody technology platform. We believe our approach to antibody discovery allows us to identify antibody candidates with superior performance characteristics while minimizing many of the toxicity and off target binding drawbacks (phenomenon occurring when antibodies bind to non-cancer cells) of other discovery technologies.
  
  Pipeline of Development Programs
 
 Below is a summary of our internally developed, proprietary portfolio:

 Our clinical development programs are centered around our HuMab-5B1 human antibody, which we have tested in 56 patients as a monotherapy, in combination with chemotherapy, and conjugated to radioisotopes in effort to establish safety and tolerability as well as to assess therapeutic benefit for patients diagnosed with pancreatic and other cancers. We will continue to enroll patients in ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials utilizing our HuMab-5B1 human antibody in the following protocols: (1) In combination with standard of care chemotherapy in newly diagnosed treatment naïve patients; and (2) As a radioimmunotherapy (“RIT”) product which utilizes the same antibody as a targeting agent and to which we attach a radionuclide to provide localize cancer cell killing effect.
  
  MVT-5873 in combination with first line therapy for pancreatic cancer patients
  
 In the Phase 1 study, MabVax’s MVT-5873, a fully human antibody, was given in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine to patients newly diagnosed with CA19-9 positive pancreatic cancer. On February 12, 2018, we reported on interim results of the current cohort of the Phase 1 study, in which MVT-5873 was given in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine to patients newly diagnosed with CA19-9 positive pancreatic cancer. MVT-5873 at a dose of 0.125 mg/kg when added to first-line chemotherapy was generally well tolerated by all subjects. All six patients in the current cohort had measurable tumor reductions, with four patients meeting the criteria for partial response (PR) and two patients meeting the criteria for stable disease (SD). These results further confirm results reported on a portion of the cohort in late 2017. Patient CA19-9 levels, which are a prognostic indicator of the disease state, were markedly reduced in all subjects with this combination therapy. We plan to enroll additional patients at this dose to further explore safety and increase statistical significance of results seen to date in a larger population.
  
  MVT-1075 radioimmunotherapy (“RIT”) for pancreatic cancer patients
  
 This Phase 1 first-in human clinical trial is an open-label, multi-center study evaluating the safety and efficacy of MVT-1075 in up to 22 patients for patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (“PDAC”) or other CA19-9 positive malignancies including colon and lung cancers. The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety profile in late stage patients with recurring disease who have failed prior therapies. Secondary objectives include evaluating tumor response rate and duration of response by RECIST 1.1, and determining dosimetry and pharmacokinetics. This dose-escalation study, which began in June 2017, utilizes a traditional 3+3 design, and is based on experience we gained through prior clinical studies that treated 50 patients with either our antibody we designate as MVT-5873, or our imaging agent we designate as MVT-2163.
  
 On February 28, 2018, we announced positive interim results from the initial three-patient cohort of the Phase 1 clinical trial. Results from the first three patients dosed in the initial cohort of this dose escalation Phase 1 safety trial demonstrated that MVT-1075 is reasonably well tolerated and accumulates on tumor as evidenced by dosimetry measurements performed after the first dose. At this initial dose, two subjects met the criteria for stable disease (SD) and one met the criteria of progressive disease (PD) as measured using RECIST 1.1 criteria. Hematologic toxicities were manageable, and the Company is enrolling the first patient in the second cohort.
  
  Exploration and Evaluation of Strategic Options
  
 In September 2017, we announced our engagement of Greenhill & Co. (NYSE: GHL) to serve as an advisor to assist the Company in exploring and evaluating strategic options with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. Greenhill & Co.’s sole mandate has been to provide MabVax with opportunities in exploring and evaluating strategic options while continuing to identify new opportunities. MabVax is currently in advanced discussions with several potential strategic partners that could result in one or more licensing and partnering transactions in the first half of 2018 of certain antibody assets for defined fields of use. However, there is no guarantee that we will enter into binding agreements with the parties introduced to us by Greenhill & Co.
  
 Post potential transactions, we expect to retain rights to core aspects of our antibody development program and intend to continue developing these core assets using funds from one or more strategic transactions. MabVax will continue to focus on advancing its Phase 1 clinical programs including MVT-5873 in combination with chemotherapy and MVT-1075 as a radioimmunotherapy.
  
  Our Growth and Core Business Strategy
  
 Our primary business strategy is to develop our early antibody product candidates through proof of concept clinical trials, which may represent either Phase I or Phase II clinical trials depending on the program and extent of progress. Once through proof of concept clinical trials, we will decide whether to license, partner or sell those product candidates, or continue to develop the candidates depending on several variables such as access to additional capital, cost of later stage clinical trials, risk of such development efforts, and the value derived from licensing, partnering or selling those assets.

  Our Clinical Development Programs
  
  MVT-5873 – for the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer
  
 MVT-5873 as a Monotherapy in Late Stage Cancer Patients – We reported results from our Phase 1a clinical trial of 32 patients being treated with our therapeutic antibody MVT-5873 as a monotherapy, which was evaluated for safety and tolerability in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and other CA19-9 positive cancers, in a poster presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting on June 3, 2017. The Company highlighted that the single agent MVT-5837 appears safe and well tolerated in patients at biologically active doses. Furthermore, all patients were evaluated by RECIST 1.1 for tumor response, and the Company reported 11 patients achieved stable disease in this dose escalation safety trial of 32 patients.
  
 The results of the Phase 1a trial with MVT-5873 indicate that this fully-human antibody targeting CA19-9 cancers can be administered at doses with acceptable safety and with a potentially positive impact on disease. The cancer antigen CA19-9 is broadly expressed in various cancers including pancreatic, colon, and small cell lung cancer making this antibody potentially useful for a larger patient population. Clinical signals from an identifiable subset of subjects enabled us to understand those patients most likely to respond to a MVT-5873 based therapy. At the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) established in this trial, we have demonstrated an acceptable safety margin for the antibody.
  
 MVT-5873 in Combination with a Standard of Care Chemotherapy – Based upon observations from the first two cohorts of patients treated, the Company is continuing clinical development of MVT-5873 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxal as a first line therapy for the treatment of patients newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. MabVax has treated six patients as of October 12, 2017 and is actively enrolling additional patients with the objective of obtaining additional safety and tumor response (RECIST 1.1) data. Dr. Eileen O’Reilly, Associate Director of the David M. Rubenstein Center for Pancreatic Cancer Research, attending physician, member at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College, is the lead investigator in the MVT-5873 Phase 1 clinical trial.
  
 On February 12, 2018, we reported on interim results of the current cohort of the Phase 1 study, in which MVT-5873 was given in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine to patients newly diagnosed with CA19-9 positive pancreatic cancer. MVT-5873 at a dose of 0.125 mg/kg when added to first-line chemotherapy was generally well tolerated by all subjects. All six patients in the current cohort had measurable tumor reductions, with four patients meeting the criteria for partial response (PR) and two patients meeting the criteria for stable disease (SD). These results further confirm results reported on a portion of the cohort in late 2017. Patient CA19-9 levels, which are a prognostic indicator of the disease state, were markedly reduced in all subjects with this combination therapy. We plan to enroll additional patients at this dose to further explore safety and increase statistical significance of results seen to date in a larger population.
  
  MVT-2163 – as an Imaging Agent for Pancreatic Cancer
  
 We reported results from our Phase 1a clinical trial of ImmunoPET imaging agent, MVT-2163, in 12 patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (PDAC) or other CA19-9 positive malignancies in a poster presentation and podium talk at the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) Annual Meeting held in Denver, CO on June 10-14, 2017.
  
 The Phase 1a clinical trial of MVT-2163 was intended to evaluate our next generation diagnostic PET imaging agent in patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (PDAC) or other CA19-9 positive malignancies. MVT-2163 (89Zr-HuMab-5B1) combines the well-established PET imaging radiolabel Zirconium-89 [89Zr] with the targeting specificity of MVT-5873. We designed the trial to establish safety, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, optimal time to obtain the PET image, and the amount of MVT-5873 to be administered as a blocking dose prior to administration of MVT-2163 to obtain optimized PET scan images.
  
 As of July 2017, 12 patients had been treated in this first-in-human trial evaluating the safety and feasibility of MVT-2163 to image pancreatic tumors and other CA19-9 positive malignancies. MVT-2163 was administered alone and in combination with MVT-5873 and was well tolerated in all cohorts. The only toxicities were infusion reactions that resolved on the day of the injection, with some patients requiring standard supportive medication. We reported that administering MVT-5873 prior to dosing MVT-2163 reduces liver uptake facilitating detection of liver metastases. In addition, we determined that the MVT-5873 cold antibody pre-dose does not interfere with the uptake of MVT-2163 on cancer lesions.

 Uptake of MVT-2163 was observed in primary tumors and metastases as early as day two and continuously through day seven. Standard Uptake Values (SUV), a measurement of activity in PET imaging, reached as high as 101 in the study. The investigators reported that the SUVs are amongst the highest lesion uptake values they have ever seen for a radiolabeled antibody. Bone and soft tissue disease were readily visualized and lesion uptake of the radiotracer was higher than typically seen with PET imaging agents. The correlation with Computerized Tomography (CT) scans was high.
  
 In summary, the MVT-2163 product produced acceptable safety tolerability, pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. MVT-2163 also produced high quality PET images identifying both primary tumor and metastatic sites. There was a promising correlation with diagnostic CT that warrants further studies correlating these findings with histopathology to assess the accuracy of MVT-2163 in identifying smaller metastatic nodes below the detection level of standard CT scans. The continual increase in high SUV values on cancer lesions in this study supports the use of the Company’s MVT-1075 radioimmunotherapy product which utilizes the same antibody to deliver a radiation dose for the treatment of patients with pancreatic, lung and colon cancers.
  
  MVT-1075 – as a Radioimmunotherapy for Pancreatic Cancer
  
 On February 28, 2018, we announced positive interim results from the initial three-patient cohort of the Phase 1 clinical trial of our HuMab-5B1 radioimmunotherapy product MVT-1075 based on experience we gained through clinical studies involving over 50 patients with either the antibody MVT-5873, or our imaging agent we designate as MVT-2163. Results from the first three patients dosed in the initial cohort of this dose escalation Phase 1 safety trial demonstrated that MVT-1075 is reasonably well tolerated and accumulates on tumor as evidenced by dosimetry measurements performed after the first dose. At this initial dose, two subjects met the criteria for stable disease (SD) and one met the criteria of progressive disease (PD) as measured using RECIST 1.1 criteria. Hematologic toxicities were manageable, and the Company is enrolling the first patient in the second cohort.
  
 MVT-1075 combines the demonstrated targeting specificity of the MVT-5873 antibody with the proven clinical success of a low-energy radiation emitter, 177Lutetium [177Lu]. We dosed MVT-1075 in our first patient in June 2017. This Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial is an open-label, multi-center study evaluating the safety and efficacy of MVT-1075 in up to 22 patients with CA19-9 positive malignancies. The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety profile in patients with recurring disease who have failed prior therapies. Secondary endpoints are to evaluate tumor response rate and duration of response by RECIST 1.1, and to determine dosimetry and pharmacokinetics. This dose-escalation study utilizes a traditional 3+3 design that is commonly used by companies as a dose escalation strategy typical for Phase 1 trials for the treatment of cancer. The investigative sites are Honor Health in Scottsdale, Arizona, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.
  
 In April 2017, we reported preclinical results for MVT-1075 at the American Association of Clinical Research (AACR) Annual Meeting, demonstrating suppression, and in some instances, regression, of tumor growth in xenograft animal models of pancreatic cancer, potentially making this product an important new therapeutic agent in the treatment of pancreatic, colon and lung cancers. Supporting the MVT-1075 RIT clinical investigation are the Company's successful MVT-5873 and MVT-2163 Phase 1a safety and target specificity data which were reported earlier this year at the annual meetings of the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the Society for Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI), respectively. The combined results from 50 patients in the Phase 1 MVT-5873 and MVT-2163 studies established safety and provided significant insight into drug biodistribution and an optimal dosing strategy, which the Company has incorporated into the MVT-1075 program.
  
  Plan for 2018
  
 Based on inquiries from third parties regarding their interest in MabVax assets and clinical progress to date with MVT-5873, MVT-1075, and MVT-2163, and with the assistance of investment advisor Greenhill & Co., we expect to be able to decide on one or more licensing and/or partnering opportunities for certain fields of use of our technology in the first half of 2018.
  
 We currently intend to continue clinical development of MVT-5873 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxal in first line therapy for the treatment of patients newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We have treated two cohorts of patients for a total of six patients through September 22, 2017 in this study with promising results achieved to date; and plan to continue enrollment of patients with the objective of confirming early observations seen to date.
  
 We currently plan to continue clinical development of MVT-1075 for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer patients, by completing additional cohorts of patients in a dose escalation safety trial to continue to assess the safety and potential efficacy of this treatment, and expect to report results from the first cohort of patients treated in the first half of 2018.

  Reverse Splits for Listing and Maintaining Listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market
  
 Listing Reverse Split – On June 29, 2016, our stockholders approved a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a range of between 1-for-2 and 1-for-15, with the specific ratio and effective time of the reverse stock split to be determined by our Board of Directors, or our Board. On August 2, 2016, the Board approved a 1-for-7.4 reverse stock split, or the Listing Reverse Split. The Listing Reverse Split was intended to allow us to meet the minimum share price requirement of The NASDAQ Capital Market, or NASDAQ. On August 11, 2016, we received approval from The NASDAQ Capital Market for the listing of our common stock under the symbol “MBVX”, subject to implementation of the Listing Reverse Split and closing of our August 2016 public offering (the “August 2016 Public Offering”). On August 16, 2016, we implemented the Listing Reverse Split, closed on the August 2016 Public Offering and began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market at the open of business on August 17, 2016.
  
 Continued Listing Reverse Split – On October 6, 2017, our stockholders approved a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a range of between 1-for-2 and 1-for-20, with the specific ratio and effective time of the reverse stock split to be determined by our Board. On February 1, 2018, the Board approved a 1-for-3 reverse stock split, or the Continued Listing Reverse Split; and, on February 16, 2018, we implemented the Continued Listing Reverse Split effective with the open of trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market on a split-adjusted basis under the same trading symbol “MBVX.” On March 5, 2018, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Capital Market notifying us that the Company has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) by achieving and maintaining the $1.00 minimum closing bid price for at least ten trading days prior to the March 5, 2018 deadline for continued listing. The primary intent of the Continued Listing Reverse Split was to increase the market price of the Company’s common stock in order to help ensure compliance with The NASDAQ Capital Market’s $1.00 minimum closing bid price continued listing maintenance requirement. All share amounts have been adjusted based on the Continued Listing Reverse Split.
  
  Consolidated Financial Statements Prepared on a Going Concern Basis
  
  We have a history of losses, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future as we continue to develop our product pipeline, resulting in the need to achieve either substantial revenues from licensing arrangements or financing transactions, as more fully described in our “Risk Factors”. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding these matters are more fully described in Item 7. “-Liquidity and Capital Resources” and in Note 1. “Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Antibody Market Opportunity
  
 The global monoclonal antibodies market was valued at $85 billion in 2015 and is expected to reach a value of $138 billion by 2024 (The Pharma Letter, February 11, 2016). Over the past couple of decades, the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has approved more than a dozen monoclonal antibodies to treat certain cancers (cancer.org). Focused development of new monoclonal antibody based drugs is expected to continue for multiple reasons.  Over the last few years much has been learned about using the human immune system to treat cancer.  Several recently approved antibody therapies have demonstrated efficacy in stimulating the human immune system to attack certain cancers. Targeted therapies can attack cancer cells while minimizing damage to normal cells in the patient. Antibodies are complex molecules and are difficult and expensive to duplicate with biosimilars and therefore have a potentially longer commercial life. Currently approved monoclonal antibodies are reimbursed at favorable levels from federal, state, and private insurance providers.
  
 Our lead antibody candidate targets an antigen called CA19-9 that is over expressed on many metastatic pancreatic, colon, breast, and small cell lung cancers. The term "over expressed" refers to the antigen being present on the surface of the cancer cell in very large numbers. This antigen is also shed by the tumor and the amount of antigen present in blood samples is used to monitor patients especially with pancreatic cancer. Elevated levels of CA19-9 are indicative of a poor prognosis and falling levels of CA19-9 indicate an improving prognosis. The CA19-9 antigen plays an important role in tumor progression and metastasis. Patients who develop metastatic disease have a significantly poorer prognosis for survival.

 We believe there is a critical unmet medical need for a better treatment for metastatic pancreatic and colon cancer. According to NCI’s SEER database (seer.cancer.gov), the five-year survival rate for patients with pancreatic cancer is only 7.7%. Annually, 53,000 new patients are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and more than half of these patients present at initial diagnosis with metastatic disease (Pancreatic Cancer Network’s Pancreatic Facts 2016). In 2016 pancreatic cancer moved from the fourth leading cause of cancer related death in the U.S. to third, surpassing breast cancer (American Cancer Society Cancer statistics 2016 report,). According to the SEER database, there are about 134,000 patients diagnosed with cancer of the colon and rectum each year in the US. The five-year survival rate for the 35% of patients who are diagnosed with metastatic colon cancer that is locally spread, is 71%. However, the five-year survival for the 35% of patients who are diagnosed with regionally spread colon cancer falls to 13.5%.
  
  Pancreatic Cancer Imaging and Diagnosis
  
  We believe that our radiolabeled HuMab-5B1 PET imaging antibody represents the only human derived agent in development specifically aimed at improving diagnostic imaging in pancreatic cancer over the standard of care (FDG-PET). Since the antigen targeted by the HuMab-5B1 antibody is over expressed on metastatic pancreatic cancer cells, this development effort represents a potentially important step forward in the diagnosis, staging, and assessment of the majority of patients newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancers. We believe that the market opportunity for a HuMab-5B1antibody-based radiopharmaceutical is significant. The ability of physicians to accurately diagnose, stage, and assess treatment outcomes in pancreatic cancer is a very important. Accurate determinations on the extent of disease and resectability are essential to improve outcomes in this cancer. We believe that limitations in FDG-PET imaging offer significant room for improvement in diagnostic technique and that accurate determinations on the extent of disease and resectability are essential to improving outcomes in this cancer. Improvements in the sensitivity and specificity over FDG-PET could have a significant impact on improving diagnosis and clinical outcome.
 Radioimmunotherapy: Therapeutic Treatment Product
  
 On February 28, 2018, we announced positive interim results from the initial three-patient cohort of the Phase 1 clinical trial. Results from the first three patients dosed in the initial cohort of this dose escalation Phase 1 safety trial demonstrated that MVT-1075 is reasonably well tolerated and accumulates on tumor as evidenced by dosimetry measurements performed after the first dose. At this initial dose, two subjects met the criteria for stable disease (SD) and one met the criteria of progressive disease (PD) as measured using RECIST 1.1 criteria. Hematologic toxicities were manageable. The Company has enrolled the first patient in the second cohort.
  
 This Phase 1 first-in human dose escalation clinical trial, which began in June 2017, is an open-label, multi-center study evaluating the safety and efficacy of MVT-1075 in up to 22 patients for patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (“PDAC”) or other CA19-9 positive malignancies including colon and lung cancers. The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety profile in late stage patients with recurring disease who have failed prior therapies. Secondary objectives include evaluating tumor response rate and duration of response by RECIST 1.1, and determining dosimetry and pharmacokinetics. This dose-escalation study utilizes a traditional 3+3 design and is based on experience we gained through prior clinical studies that treated 50 patients with either MVT-5873, or our imaging agent MVT-2163.
  
  License and Development Agreements
  
  Memorial Sloan Kettering
  
 We have licensed from MSK the exclusive world-wide developmental and commercial rights to receive biological materials from vaccinated clinical trial participants enrolled in any of the clinical trials involving the vaccines licensed to us, allowing us to discover human monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics. MSK has issued patents or has pending patent applications on the vaccine antigen conjugates, mixtures of vaccine antigen conjugates and methods of use. This patent portfolio includes 12 issued patents in the U.S.  We own all monoclonal antibodies produced by the antibody discovery program and we generally file patent applications directed to these antibodies once their potential therapeutic utility has been sufficiently demonstrated in animal models. United States and foreign patent applications for each of the anti-sLea antibodies and the anti-GD2 antibodies described in this document have been filed. Within these filings, one U.S. patent has issued for each of the anti-sLea antibodies and the anti-GD2 antibodies
 Life Technologies Licensing Agreement
  
 On September 24, 2015, we entered into a licensing agreement with Life Technologies Corporation, a subsidiary of ThermoFisher Scientific (“Life Technologies”).  Under the agreement we licensed certain cell lines from Life Technologies used in the production of recombinant proteins for our clinical trials.  The amount of the contract was $450,000 and was fully expensed in 2015.  We paid $225,000 in 2015 and the remainder in 2016.

  Rockefeller University Collaboration
  
 Effective July 1, 2015, we entered into a research collaboration agreement with Rockefeller University's Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Immunology (“Rockefeller”). We provided antibody material to Rockefeller, which is exploring the mechanism of action of constant region (Fc) variants of the HuMab 5B1 in the role of tumor clearance. The agreement allowed researchers at Rockefeller to conduct studies on antibodies discovered by us with the objective of improving their ability to kill cancer cells.  If a viable drug candidate emerges from this collaboration, we have the right to enter into negotiations with Rockefeller for the right to exclusively license the technology used to improve our antibody for clinical and commercial development.  If we and Rockefeller fail to reach agreement on terms for a license to the drug candidate that contains the combined technologies, Rockefeller does not have the right to license the drug candidate to a third party without our consent because the drug candidate contains our intellectual property embodied in the antibody. The research collaboration agreement expired in July of 2017 but the provisions of confidentiality and right to enter negotiations for certain technology remain in place.
 Juno Option Agreement
  
 On August 29, 2014, we entered into an Option Agreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (“Juno”) in exchange for a one-time up-front option fee in the low five figures. Pursuant to the option agreement, we granted Juno the option to obtain an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license authorizing Juno to develop, make, have made, use, import, have imported, sell, have sold, offer for sale and otherwise exploit certain patents we developed with respect to fully human antibodies with binding specificity against human GD2 or sialyl-Lewis A antigens and certain of our controlled biologic materials. As of June 30, 2016, the option agreement expired and Juno no longer has a contractual right for use of our binding domains for use in the construction of CAR T-cells.
 Patents
  
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our vaccines and monoclonal antibody-based candidates, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
  
 As of April 2, 2018, we are the exclusive licensee or sole assignee of 14 granted U.S. patents, 3 pending U.S. patent applications and 19 pending foreign patent applications.  The patents and patent applications include claims to vaccine antigen conjugates, mixtures of vaccine antigen conjugates that makeup polyvalent vaccine candidates, processes for their preparation and their use as a vaccine. Two of the granted U.S. patents have claims to human anti-sLea and anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies, conjugates and pharmaceutical compositions of the human anti-sLea and anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies, nucleic acids encoding the human anti-sLea and anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies and processes for the use of the anti-sLea monoclonal antibodies as therapeutic and diagnostic agents. Two of the pending United States patent applications and the 19 foreign patent applications have claims to human anti-sLea and anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies, conjugates and pharmaceutical compositions of the human anti-sLea and anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies, nucleic acids encoding the human anti-sLea and anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies, processes for their use as therapeutic agents and processes for the use of the anti-sLea monoclonal antibodies as diagnostic agents.
  
 On October 13, 2017, the Company filed a patent application for its series of HuMab-Tn fully-human monoclonal antibodies that target the tumor associated Thomsen-nouveau (Tn) antigen that will be developed as therapeutic and diagnostic products targeting ovarian, lung and breast cancers. The Tn target is a carbohydrate antigen significantly expressed on the surface of cancer cells as a result of the transformation of normal cells into cancer cells. The Tn target is present on a broad array of tumor types but not found on normal tissues. This patent application represents another valuable antibody asset brought forward by MabVax and the third patent filed on the antibody portfolio created through the Company’s unique discovery platform. 
  
 Our success depends significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of fully human monoclonal antibodies.
  
 We believe that we have a sufficient intellectual property position and substantial know-how relating to the development and commercialization of our vaccine and monoclonal antibody-based candidates in the markets described herein, consisting of patents or patent applications that we have licensed from MSK or that we have filed ourselves. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.

 Our objective is to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to our vaccine and monoclonal antibody programs. We intend to pursue, maintain, and defend patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business.
  
  Marketing and Sales
  
 We currently do not have an internal sales force and do not intend to commercialize on our own any of our product candidates that receive FDA approval.  We intend to license, or enter into strategic alliances with, larger companies in the biopharmaceutical businesses, which are equipped to manufacture, market and/or sell our products, if any, through their well-developed manufacturing capabilities and distribution networks. We intend to license some or all of our worldwide patent rights to more than one third party to achieve the fullest development, marketing and distribution of any products we develop.
 Manufacturing and Raw Materials
  
 We currently use and expect to continue to use contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates. Our contract manufacturers are subject to extensive governmental regulation. Regulatory authorities in the pharmaceutical industry require that pharmaceutical products be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current cGMPs. We intend to establish a quality control and quality assurance program, which will include a set of standard operating procedures and specifications designed to ensure that our products are manufactured in accordance with cGMPs, and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations.
  
 We currently do not have any clinical or commercial antibody-based therapeutic manufacturing capabilities. We likely will use contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates.
  
  Competition
  
 The drug development and medical diagnostic industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition.  Our competitors include development and diagnostic companies that have significantly more financial, technical, and marketing resources.   In addition, there are a significant number of biotechnology companies working on evolving technologies that may supplant our technology or make it obsolete.  Academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and may commercialize product candidates either on their own or through joint ventures that compete with one or more of our product candidates.  We are aware of certain development projects for products to prevent or treat certain diseases targeted by us.  The existence of these potential products or other products or treatments of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be developed in the future, may adversely affect the desirability and commercial success of any product candidate for which we receive FDA approval.
  
 There are several companies engaged in human antibody development and imaging that could compete in similar clinical areas, including disease detection, therapeutic response monitoring and minimal disease detection.  These companies include AbCellera Biologics, Inc., Agenus Inc., Atreca, Inc., Immunomedics, Inc., Theraclone Sciences Inc., and Trellis Bioscience.
  
  Government Regulation
  
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and failure to abide by applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution, disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approval, refusal to approve pending applications, and criminal prosecution.

  FDA Approval Process
  
 We believe that our product candidates will be regulated by the FDA as drugs. No manufacturer may market a new drug until it has submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA, and the FDA has approved it. The steps required before the FDA may approve an NDA generally include:
  
  ●
preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted in compliance with FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements;

  ●
development, manufacture and testing of active pharmaceutical product and dosage forms suitable for human use in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or GMP;

  ●
the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;

  ●
adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its specific

 intended use(s);
   ●
the submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA; and

  ●
FDA review and approval of the NDA.

 
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. We must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we may commence human clinical trials. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after its receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions before that time about the conduct of the proposed trials. In such a case, we must work with the FDA to resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board for approval. An institutional review board may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the institutional review board’s requirements or may impose other conditions.
  
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to humans under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, though the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects, the drug is usually tested for safety (adverse effects), dosage tolerance and pharmacologic action, as well as to understand how the drug is taken up by and distributed within the body. Phase 2 usually involves studies in a limited patient population (individuals with the disease under study) to:
  
  ●
evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted conditions;

  ●
determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage as well as other important information about how to design larger Phase 3 trials; and

  ●
identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.

 
 Phase 3 trials generally further evaluate clinical efficacy and test for safety within an expanded patient population. The conduct of the clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with good clinical practice regulations and guidance.
  
 The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. We may also suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds.
  
 The results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. If the NDA contains all pertinent information and data, the FDA will “file” the application and begin review. The FDA may “refuse to file” the NDA if it does not contain all pertinent information and data. In that case, the applicant may resubmit the NDA when it contains the missing information and data. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications. Most such applications for non-priority drug products are reviewed within 10 months. The review process, however, may be extended by FDA requests for additional information, preclinical or clinical studies, clarification regarding information already provided in the submission, or submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured and will not approve the product candidate unless GMP compliance is satisfactory. FDA also typically inspects facilities responsible for performing animal testing, as well as clinical investigators who participate in clinical trials. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information. The FDA may also limit the indications for use and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and our product candidates may not be approved on a timely basis, if at all. The time and expense required to perform the clinical testing necessary to obtain FDA approval for regulated products can frequently exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product. The results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials of our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of the results from large-scale clinical trials, and clinical trials may be subject to additional costs, delays or modifications due to several factors, including difficulty in obtaining enough patients, investigators or product candidate supply. Failure by us to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals or in complying with requirements could adversely affect the commercialization of product candidates and our ability to receive product or royalty revenues.
  
  Other Regulatory Requirements
  
 After approval, drug products are subject to extensive continuing regulation by the FDA, which include company obligations to manufacture products in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, maintain and provide to the FDA updated safety and efficacy information, report adverse experiences with the product, keep certain records and submit periodic reports, obtain FDA approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, and comply with FDA promotion and advertising requirements and restrictions. Failure to meet these obligations can result in various adverse consequences, both voluntary and FDA-imposed, including product recalls, withdrawal of approval, restrictions on marketing, and the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties against the NDA holder. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown safety or efficacy issues may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or NDA holder.
  
 We and any manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s GMP regulations. GMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet GMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and any third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.
  
 With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the FDA imposes several complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting drugs for uses or in-patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
  
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
  
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
  
 Outside the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the European Union registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one European Union member state.

 We are also subject to various environmental, health and safety regulations including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials. From time to time, and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous materials.
  
  Orphan Drugs
  
 Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
 Foreign Regulation
  
 Before our products can be marketed outside of the U.S., they are subject to regulatory approval of the respective authorities in the country that the product will be marketed. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices might not be approved for such product.
  
 In Europe, marketing authorizations may be submitted at a centralized, a decentralized or national level; however, the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all European member states. There can be no assurance that the chosen regulatory strategy will secure regulatory approval on a timely basis or at all.
  
 While we intend to market our products outside the United States in compliance with our respective license agreements, we have not made any applications with foreign authorities and have no timeline for such applications or marketing.
