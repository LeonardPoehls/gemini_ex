SALES AND CUSTOMER SERVICE
We believe providing superior sales and customer service is fundamental to our business. We strive to maintain a high standard of customer service by staffing the customer support team with appropriately trained personnel who are equipped to handle customer inquiries in a prompt and thorough manner. Our customer service representatives utilize our proprietary web-based platform that enables our team to reduce the number of touch-points required to answer customer inquiries. We also have specialized customer service programs that are tailored to the needs of each core customer group. We provide sales and customer support through the following channels of our registered broker-dealer and investment advisory subsidiaries:

 | Online 
Our Online Service Center serves as a portal where customers can request services on their accounts and obtain answers to frequently asked questions. The online service center also provides customers with the ability to send a secure message and/or engage in live chat with one of our customer service representatives. In addition, we offer our Investor Education Center, providing customers with access to a variety of live and on-demand educational content and courses.

Customers can also contact our financial consultants via phone or e-mail if they cannot visit the branches. 

COMPETITION
The online financial services industry continues to evolve and remains highly competitive. Our core brokerage business competes with full service brokerage firms, Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs), discount brokerage firms, online brokerage firms, personal finance start-ups, internet banks and traditional "brick & mortar" retail banks and thrifts. Some of these competitors provide online trading and banking services, investment advisor services, robo-advice capabilities, touchtone telephone and voice response banking services, electronic bill payment services and a host of other financial products. We also compete with all users of market liquidity, including the types of competitors listed above, in order to obtain the least expensive source of funding.
Competition in the financial services industry continues to intensify, particularly amidst continued consolidation and declines in pricing over time. The proliferation of emerging financial technology start-ups further evidences the continued shift to digital advice. Our future success will rely upon our ability to keep providing digitally compelling and easy to use products and solutions to retail customers.
We also face competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to compete effectively in financial services will depend upon our ability to attract new employees, and retain and motivate our existing employees while efficiently managing compensation-related costs.

REGULATION
Our business is subject to regulation, primarily by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and certain self-regulatory organizations (SROs), such as central banks and securities exchanges, that have been charged with the protection of the financial markets and the interests of those participating in those markets. We, along with other larger institutions, have been subject to a broad range of rules and regulations and a climate of heightened regulatory scrutiny, particularly with respect to compliance with laws and regulations, including controls and business processes. This scrutiny and related rule-making has resulted in part from the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act contains various provisions designed to enhance financial stability and to reduce the likelihood of another financial crisis and significantly changed the bank regulatory structure of our Company and its thrift subsidiaries. While the substance and full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and other laws and regulations to which we are subject may be affected by changes in the U.S. political landscape and may not be fully known for months or years, we expect to continue to incur costs to implement the new requirements and monitor for continued compliance.
Regulators
Our primary regulators include, among others, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the National Futures Association (NFA), the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
Financial Services Regulation
Our regulators and regulatory examiners are increasingly focused on ensuring that our customer privacy, data protection, information security and cyber security-related policies and practices are adequate to inform consumers of our data collection, use, sharing and/or security practices, to provide them with choices, if required, about how we use and share their information, and to safeguard their personal information. We maintain systems designed to comply with these privacy, data protection, information security and cyber security requirements, including procedures designed to securely process, transmit and store confidential information and protect against unauthorized access to such information. 
Our brokerage and banking entities are also required to disclose their privacy policies and practices related to sharing customer information with affiliates and non-affiliates by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. These rules give customers the ability to "opt out" of having non-public information disclosed to third parties or receiving marketing solicitations from affiliates and non-affiliates based on non-public information received from our brokerage and banking entities.
As well, our brokerage and banking entities are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001 (BSA/USA PATRIOT Act), which requires financial institutions to develop anti-money laundering (AML) programs to assist in the prevention and detection of money laundering and combating terrorism. In order to comply with the BSA/USA PATRIOT Act, we have an AML department that is responsible for developing and implementing our enterprise-wide programs for compliance with the various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations. Our brokerage and banking entities are also subject to U.S. sanctions laws administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and we have policies and procedures in place to comply with these laws.
Brokerage Regulation
Our U.S. broker-dealers are registered with the SEC and are subject to regulation by the SEC and by SROs, such as FINRA and the securities exchanges of which each is a member, as well as various state regulators. In addition, they are registered with the CFTC as futures commission merchants (FCMs) and are members of the NFA. Such regulation covers various aspects of these broker-dealers, including for example, client protection, net capital requirements, required books and records, safekeeping of funds and securities, trading, prohibited transactions, public offerings, margin lending, customer qualifications for 
E*TRADE | 2016 10-K                                         6

margin and options transactions, registration of personnel and transactions with affiliates. Our international broker-dealer is regulated by the Hong Kong Securities & Futures Commission.
In April 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor published its final fiduciary regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. While currently scheduled to take effect in 2017, it is possible that implementation may be delayed. These regulations will subject certain persons, such as broker-dealers and other financial services providers that provide investment advice to individual retirement accounts and other qualified retirement plans and accounts, to fiduciary duties and prohibited transaction restrictions for a wider range of customer interactions. The Company is in the process of implementing the regulations, which has resulted in additional internal costs and expenses. Implementation of the regulations will have an impact on how advice is provided to our customers' tax-qualified retirement accounts and benefit plans and, in their current form, may diminish our profitability and will increase potential liabilities with respect to these accounts and plans. 
Banking Regulation
Our banking entities are subject to regulation, supervision and examination for safety and soundness by the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC and CFPB for compliance with federal banking and consumer finance laws. Such regulation covers all aspects of the banking business, including lending practices, safeguarding deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel.
The Federal Reserve has primary jurisdiction for the supervision and regulation of savings and loan holding companies, including the Company. We are required to file periodic reports with the Federal Reserve and are subject to examination and supervision by it. The Federal Reserve has issued guidance aligning the supervisory and regulatory standards of savings and loan holding companies more closely with the standards applicable to bank holding companies on such matters as liquidity risk management, securitizations, operational risk management, internal controls and audit systems, business continuity and compensation and other employee benefits.
E*TRADE Bank is a federally chartered savings association and therefore is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, because E*TRADE Bank is an insured depository institution, it is subject to supervision by the FDIC.
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, all companies, including savings and loan holding companies, that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution are required to serve as a source of strength for the institution.
Regulatory Capital Requirements
The Dodd-Frank Act also imposed new banking regulatory capital requirements at the Company, effective January 1, 2015. Previously, only E*TRADE Bank was subject to bank regulatory capital requirements.
In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies finalized a rule to implement Basel III in the U.S., which provides the framework for the calculation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets. The rule became effective for us and for E*TRADE Bank on January 1, 2015, subject to a phase-in period for certain requirements over several years. The Basel III rule established Common Equity Tier 1 capital as a new tier of capital, raised the minimum thresholds for required capital, increased minimum required risk-based capital ratios, narrowed the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, provided for new regulatory capital deductions and adjustments, and modified methods for calculating risk-weighted assets (the denominator of risk-based capital ratios) by, among other things, strengthening counterparty credit risk capital requirements. 
The Basel III final rule also introduces a capital conservation buffer that limits a banking organization’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if a banking organization fails to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of at least 2.5%, on a fully phased-in basis, of total risk-weighted assets above each of the following minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements: Common Equity Tier 1 (4.5%), Tier 1 (6.0%), and total risk-based capital (8.0%). This requirement was effective beginning on January 1, 2016, and will be fully phased-in by 2019. In addition, certain new deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital are subject to a phase-in period over a 
E*TRADE | 2016 10-K                                         7

four year period that began at 40% in 2015 and will be fully implemented at 100% in 2018. We expect to remain compliant with the Basel III framework as it is phased-in.
In addition, in certain circumstances each of our banking entities may be subject to restrictions on their ability to declare dividends or make capital distributions and may be required to submit applications or requests for non-objection from the OCC or the Federal Reserve in connection with a planned capital distribution. A federal savings association, such as E*TRADE Bank, must file an application with the OCC if, among other things, the association would not be at least “adequately capitalized” following the distribution. Where no application or non-objection is required, a federal savings association is still required to provide the OCC with notice of the proposed distribution. Federal savings associations that are subsidiaries of savings and loan holding companies may also be required to obtain the non-objection of or provide notice of a proposed dividend to the Federal Reserve. If the association is not otherwise required to file an application or notice with the OCC, it must provide the OCC with a copy of the notice at the same time that it is filed with the Federal Reserve. A savings and loan holding company, such as the Company, is also required to notify and consult with the Federal Reserve in advance of taking capital actions when, among other things, doing so could create safety and soundness concerns or the savings and loan holding company is experiencing financial weakness. 
The FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. While these regulations apply only to banks, such as E*TRADE Bank, the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against the parent savings and loan holding company, such as the Company, based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, we would be required to guarantee the performance of a capital restoration plan if our bank subsidiary were undercapitalized.
Deposit Insurance Assessments
Each of our banking entities has deposits insured by the FDIC and pays quarterly assessments to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), maintained by the FDIC, for this insurance coverage. On March 25, 2016, the FDIC published its final rule to add a surcharge to the regular DIF assessments of banks with $10 billion or more in assets, which includes E*TRADE Bank. Under the final rule, E*TRADE Bank is subject to an additional surcharge applied to its assessment base, which took effect for the assessment period beginning on July 1, 2016. Surcharges at an annual rate of 4.5 basis points will be assessed until the sooner of (1) the DIF attaining the minimum reserve ratio of 1.35 percent of insured deposits or (2) the fourth quarter of 2018. The FDIC anticipates eight quarters of "surcharge assessments." There may be a one-time “shortfall assessment” in the first quarter of 2019 to bring the fund immediately to 1.35 percent if needed. The surcharge has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
Home Owners' Loan Act
Under the Home Owners’ Loan Act (HOLA), the OCC requires E*TRADE Bank to comply with the qualified thrift lender (QTL) test. Under the QTL test, E*TRADE Bank is required to maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in certain “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities, credit card loans, student loans and small business loans) in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. E*TRADE Bank currently meets that test. A savings association that fails to meet the QTL test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a national bank charter.
Derivatives
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act subjects derivatives that we enter into for hedging, risk management and other purposes to a comprehensive regulatory regime. This regime requires central clearing and execution on designated markets or execution facilities for certain standardized derivatives and imposes or will impose margin, documentation, trade reporting and other new requirements. We are currently in compliance with these requirements as they apply to our activities.
E*TRADE | 2016 10-K                                         8

Volcker Rule
In December 2013, the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, SEC and CFTC issued final rules to implement section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (these rules collectively known as the "Volcker Rule"). The Volcker Rule imposes prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of banking entities and nonbank financial companies to engage in proprietary trading, and to have certain interests in, or relationships with, hedge funds or private equity funds. Banking entities were required to bring all of their activities and investments into conformance with the Volcker Rule by July 21, 2015, subject to certain extensions. In addition, the Volcker Rule requires banking entities to have comprehensive compliance programs reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the Volcker Rule. We are currently in compliance with all Volcker Rule requirements applicable to our operations.
Stress Testing
In October 2012, federal banking regulators issued final rules implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that require banking organizations with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion to conduct annual company-run stress tests, report the results to their primary federal regulator and the Federal Reserve and publish a summary of the results. Under the rules, stress tests must be conducted using certain scenarios (baseline, adverse and severely adverse), which the Federal Reserve publishes by February 15 of each year. 
E*TRADE Bank is required to publish certain results of its annual stress test between October 15 and October 31 each year. In October 2016, E*TRADE Bank publicly disclosed a summary of its stress test results under the severely adverse scenario prescribed by the Federal Reserve and OCC based upon a nine-quarter period beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on March 31, 2018. In the summary, E*TRADE Bank reported that its Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.7% at the beginning of the forecast period declined to 8.5% at the end of the nine-quarter forecast horizon, which is well in excess of required minimum capital levels. 
The Company will be required to conduct its first annual stress test using financial statement data as of December 31, 2016, report the results of the stress test to the Federal Reserve on or before July 31, 2017, and disclose a summary of the stress test results in October 2017. 
For additional regulatory information on our brokerage and banking regulations, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 19—Regulatory Requirements.
Regulatory Developments
The Company is currently not subject to certain regulatory requirements that apply to banking organizations with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets as defined by each applicable regulation. Fifty billion dollars in total consolidated assets, which is measured in accordance with each applicable regulation, but generally on the basis of the average of the four most recent quarters, is a meaningful regulatory threshold, as U.S. banking organizations become subject to a number of additional, and in some cases more stringent, regulatory requirements once they reach that size. The Company expects these regulations, not all of which have been finalized, to become applicable as it surpassed $50 billion in total consolidated assets in the first quarter of 2017 and expects to surpass $50 billion on a four quarter average later this year. The Company has begun implementing policies, procedures, systems and governance structures that are designed to comply with the anticipated requirements. Additionally, while savings and loan holding companies are currently excluded from the scope of certain regulations that apply to bank holding companies, the Company expects it will ultimately be subject to these requirements. 
Comprehensive Capital Adequacy Review
The Company is currently not subject to the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, which requires certain financial institutions to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve. Through the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve may object to a banking organization's planned capital actions for the coming year. When the Federal Reserve objects to a capital plan, the banking organization may not make any capital distributions unless expressly permitted by the Federal Reserve. When the Federal Reserve does not object to a capital plan, the banking organization must request prior approval for any capital distributions that will exceed the amount described in the capital plan. The Company expects the 
E*TRADE | 2016 10-K                                         9

CCAR process, which currently only applies to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of greater than or equal to $50 billion on a four quarter average, will be applicable to the Company in the future and will continue to monitor related regulatory updates and developments. 
Resolution and Recovery Plans
In October 2011, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC issued a final rule requiring bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, based on the average of the four most recent quarters, to submit resolution plans and requiring each plan to describe the company’s strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy during times of financial distress. The Company is not currently subject to this rule as savings and loan holding companies are currently excluded from its scope.
In January 2012, the FDIC issued interim final rules requiring insured depository institutions, such as E*TRADE Bank, with total assets of $50 billion or more, based on the average of the four most recent quarters, to submit to the FDIC periodic plans providing for their resolution by the FDIC in the event of failure (resolution plans or living wills) under the receivership and liquidation provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. E*TRADE Bank is currently not subject to these rules, but if it were to exceed the asset threshold, it would be required to file with the FDIC an annual resolution plan demonstrating how it could be resolved in an orderly and timely manner in the event of receivership such that the FDIC would be able to ensure the bank's depositors receive access to their deposits within one business day, to maximize the net present value of the bank's assets when disposed of, and to minimize losses incurred by the bank's creditors. 
In September 2016, the OCC published final guidelines that establish standards for recovery planning by insured national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches of foreign banks with average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, based on the average of the four most recent quarters. E*TRADE Bank is currently not subject to these guidelines, but if it were to exceed the asset threshold, it would be required to develop and maintain a recovery plan for identifying and responding rapidly to significant stress events that could affect its financial condition and threaten its viability. The recovery plan would need to identify triggers for escalation of information to senior management and the board of directors, identify a wide range of credible options that E*TRADE Bank could undertake in response to severe stress, and be integrated into E*TRADE Bank’s risk governance function.
Liquidity Requirements
In September 2014, federal banking agencies issued a final inter-agency rule that imposes a quantitative liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement on large banking institutions. The purpose of the LCR is to require banking organizations to hold minimum amounts of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) based on a percentage of their net cash outflows over a 30-day period. Banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or foreign exposures of $10 billion or more must hold HQLA in an amount equal to at least 100% of their projected net cash outflows over a 30-day period. Bank and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, based on the average of the four most recent quarters, are subject to a modified LCR requiring them to hold HQLA in an amount equal to at least 70% of their projected net cash outflows over a 30-day period. The Company believes the LCR is an important measure of liquidity and has been managing against it in preparation for the applicability of these requirements. Based on anticipated balance sheet growth the Company expects to be subject to these requirements beginning April 1, 2018.
In May 2016, federal banking agencies issued a proposed inter-agency rule that would impose a net stable funding requirement, the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), for large banking organizations with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The proposed NSFR requirement would require a banking organization subject to the rule to maintain a sufficient level of stable funding relative to a measure based on the liquidity, maturity, quality and other characteristics of the organization’s assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures. The proposed NSFR requirement is designed to reduce the likelihood that disruptions to a banking organization’s regular sources of funding will compromise its liquidity position, as well as to promote improvements in the measurement and management of liquidity risk. The proposed NSFR requirement would apply to the same banking organizations that are subject to the LCR, and, also like the LCR, includes a modified version of the requirement for bank and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more and less than $250 billion, based on the average of the four most recent quarters. Banking organizations subject to the modified NSFR would be required to maintain a 
E*TRADE | 2016 10-K                                         10

lower stable funding amount and have additional time to comply once they become subject to the requirements. The proposal contemplates that the NSFR would go into effect on January 1, 2018.
