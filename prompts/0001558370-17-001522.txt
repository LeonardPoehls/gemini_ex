     Item 1.  Business
     The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information included elsewhere in this Report. This description contains forward‑looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ significantly from the projections and results discussed in the forward‑looking statements due to the factors described under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Report. References in this Report to “we,” “our,” “us,” and the “Company” refer to PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (“PFSI”).     Our Company
     We are a specialty financial services firm with a comprehensive mortgage platform and integrated business primarily focused on the production and servicing of U.S. residential mortgage loans (activities which we refer to as mortgage banking) and the management of investments related to the U.S. mortgage market. We believe that our operating capabilities, specialized expertise, access to long-term investment capital, and our management’s experience across all aspects of the mortgage business will allow us to profitably grow these activities and capitalize on other related opportunities as they arise in the future.
     We were formed as a corporation in December 2012. On May 14, 2013, we completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) in which we sold approximately 12.8 million shares of Class A Common Stock par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”) for cash consideration. With the net proceeds from the IPO, we bought approximately 12.8 million Class A units of Private National Mortgage Acceptance Company, LLC (“PennyMac”) and became its sole managing member. We operate and control all of the business and affairs and consolidate the financial results of PennyMac.
     PennyMac was founded in 2008 by members of our executive leadership team and two strategic partners, BlackRock Mortgage Ventures, LLC (“BlackRock” or “BlackRock, Inc.”) and HC Partners, LLC, formerly known as Highfields Capital Investments, LLC, together with its affiliates (“Highfields”).
     We conduct our business in three segments: loan production, loan servicing (together, these two activities comprise mortgage banking activities) and investment management. Our principal mortgage banking subsidiary, PennyMac Loan Services, LLC (“PLS”), is a non-bank producer and servicer of mortgage loans in the United States. PLS is a seller/servicer for the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), each of which is a government‑sponsored entity (“GSE”). It is also an approved issuer of securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”), a lender of the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), a lender/servicer of the Veterans Administration (“VA”) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), and a servicer for the Home Affordable Modification Program (“HAMP”). We refer to each of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, FHA, VA and USDA as an “Agency” and collectively as the “Agencies.” PLS is able to service loans in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and originate loans in 49 states and the District of Columbia, either because PLS is properly licensed in a particular jurisdiction or exempt or otherwise not required to be licensed in that jurisdiction.
     PNMAC Capital Management, LLC (“PCM”), a Delaware limited liability company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, manages PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (“PMT”), a mortgage real estate investment trust, listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PMT. PCM also manages PNMAC Mortgage Opportunity Fund, LLC and PNMAC Mortgage Opportunity Fund, LP, both registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act”), as amended, an affiliate of these Funds and PNMAC Mortgage Opportunity Fund Investors, LLC. We refer to these funds collectively as our “Investment Funds” and, together with PMT, as our “Advised Entities.”

 Mortgage Banking
     Loan Production
     Our loan production segment sources mortgage loans through two channels: correspondent production and consumer direct lending.
     In correspondent production we manage, on behalf of PMT and for our own account, the acquisition of newly originated, prime credit quality, first-lien residential mortgage loans that have been underwritten to investor guidelines. PMT acquires, from approved correspondent sellers, newly originated mortgage loans, including both conventional and government-insured or guaranteed residential mortgage loans that qualify for inclusion in securitizations that are guaranteed by the Agencies. For conventional mortgage loans, we perform fulfillment activities for PMT and earn a fulfillment fee for each mortgage loan purchased by PMT. In the case of government insured mortgage loans, we fulfill them for our own account and purchase them from PMT at PMT’s cost plus a sourcing fee. 
     Through our consumer direct lending channel, we originate new prime credit quality, first-lien residential conventional and government-insured or guaranteed mortgage loans on a national basis to allow customers to purchase or refinance their homes. The consumer direct model relies on the Internet and call center-based staff to acquire and interact with customers across the country. We do not have a “brick and mortar” branch network and have been developing our consumer direct operations with call centers strategically positioned across the United States.
     For mortgage loans originated through our consumer direct lending channel, we conduct our own fulfillment, earn interest income and gains or losses during the holding period and upon the sale or securitization of these loans, and retain the associated MSRs (subject to sharing with PMT a portion of such MSRs or cash with respect to certain consumer direct originated mortgage loans that refinance mortgage loans for which the related MSRs or excess servicing spread (“ESS”) was held by PMT).
     Our loan production activity is summarized below:
    
 | Year ended December 31, | 
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 
 | (in thousands) | 
Unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans purchased and originated for sale: | | | | | | | 
Government-insured or guaranteed mortgage loans acquired from PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust | $ | 39,908,163 | | $ | 31,490,920 | $ | 16,431,338
Mortgage loans sourced through our consumer direct channel | | 6,491,107 | | | 4,143,239 | | 1,952,505 
 | $ | 46,399,270 | | $ | 35,634,159 | $ | 18,383,843
Unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans fulfilled for PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust | $ | 23,188,386 | | $ | 14,014,603 | $ | 11,476,448

      Loan Servicing
     Our loan servicing segment performs loan administration, collection, and default management activities, including the collection and remittance of loan payments; response to customer inquiries; accounting for principal and interest; holding custodial (impounded) funds for the payment of property taxes and insurance premiums; counseling delinquent mortgagors; and supervising foreclosures and property dispositions. We service a diverse portfolio of mortgage loans both as the owner of MSRs and on behalf of other MSR or mortgage owners. We provide servicing for conventional and government-insured or guaranteed loans (“prime servicing”), as well as servicing for distressed mortgage loans that have been acquired as investments by our Advised Entities (“special servicing”). As of December 31, 2016, the portfolio of mortgage loans that we serviced or subserviced totaled approximately $194.2 billion in unpaid principal balance (“UPB”).

 Investment Management
     We are an investment manager through our subsidiary, PCM. PCM currently manages PMT and the Investment Funds. PMT and the Investment Funds had combined net assets of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2016. For these activities, we earn management fees as a percentage of net assets and may earn incentive compensation based on investment performance.     U.S. Mortgage Market
     The U.S. residential mortgage market is one of the largest financial markets in the world, with approximately $10 trillion of outstanding debt and average annual origination volume of $1.8 trillion for the five years ending December 31, 2016. Many of the largest financial institutions, including banks which have traditionally held the majority of the market share in mortgage originations and servicing, have reduced their participation in the mortgage market and the industry remains in a period of significant transformation, creating opportunities for non-bank participants.
     The residential mortgage industry is characterized by high barriers to entry, including the necessity for approvals required to sell loans to and service loans for the Agencies, state licensing requirements for non-federally chartered banks, sophisticated infrastructure, technology, and processes required for successful operations, and financial capital requirements.
     Our Growth Strategies
     Since our establishment, we have demonstrated our ability to apply our residential mortgage expertise and operating capabilities to multiple business opportunities. In the initial years of our operation, for example, we identified investing in distressed mortgage assets as an attractive opportunity and we raised and deployed capital through a series of successful transactions. As the mortgage market presented opportunities in new loan production and servicing, we expanded our management and capabilities to profitably capitalize on these businesses as well.
     Our growth strategies include:
     Growing our Mortgage Loan Servicing Portfolio
     We expect to grow our servicing portfolio on an organic basis, as our correspondent government‑insured production and consumer direct lending add new prime servicing for owned MSRs, and correspondent conventional production adds new subservicing. In 2016, our correspondent and consumer direct loan production totaled $69.7 billion in UPB. We plan to supplement our organic growth with MSR acquisitions, some of which may be concentrated in delinquent or defaulted loans for which we have expertise in servicing. We have acquired MSRs from large mortgage servicers, which are selling MSRs due to continuing operational and regulatory pressures, higher regulatory capital requirements for banks, and a re-focus on core customers and business, and from independent mortgage banks, which are selling MSRs due to reduced origination volumes, operational losses, and a need for capital.  During 2016, we completed the acquisition from a large bank of approximately $1 billion in UPB of MSRs related to defaulted government-insured loans.     Growing Correspondent Production through Expanding Seller Relationships
     We expect to grow our correspondent production business by expanding the number and types of sellers from which we purchase loans and increasing the volume of loans that we purchase from our sellers as we continue to add to the loan products and services we offer, and deepen our participation in certain geographic markets in the United States. Over the past several years, a number of large banks have exited or reduced the size of their correspondent production businesses, creating an opportunity for non‑bank entities to gain market share. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity based on our management expertise in the correspondent production business, our relationships with correspondent sellers, and our supporting systems and processes.

 Growing Consumer Direct Lending through Portfolio Refinance and Non‑Portfolio Originations
     We expect to grow our consumer direct lending business by leveraging our growing servicing portfolio through refinance and purchase-money loans for existing customers as well as increasing our non‑portfolio originations. As our servicing portfolio grows, we will have a greater number of leads to pursue, which we believe will lead to greater origination activity through our consumer direct business. At the same time, we are making significant investments in technology, personnel and marketing to increase our non‑portfolio originations. We believe that our national call center model and our technology will enable us to drive origination process efficiencies and best‑in‑class customer service.
     Expansion into new markets
    
We regularly evaluate opportunities to grow our business, including expansion into new markets, such as the wholesale lending channel and non-delegated correspondent lending services. The wholesale lending channel involves the underwriting and funding of mortgage loans sourced by mortgage loan brokers and other financial intermediaries. We estimate that the wholesale lending channel represents approximately 10% of U.S. residential mortgage originations and we are currently in the process of developing the systems and processes to enter that market. In 2016, we launched a non-delegated correspondent service to complement our delegated correspondent channel. The non-delegated correspondent lending service involves the purchase by PMT of loans for which PLS has provided underwriting eligibility services to the originating correspondent seller.  Entry into this market leverages our existing loan fulfillment infrastructure, gives our existing sellers an additional method through which they can deliver loans to us and provides us with access to new sellers that were not previously served. In 2015, we entered the commercial real estate finance business, with a focus on small balance multifamily loans (typically under $10 million in UPB).
     Compliance and Regulatory
     Our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. Our loan production and loan servicing operations are primarily regulated at the state level by state licensing authorities and administrative agencies, with additional oversight from the CFPB. We, along with certain PennyMac employees who engage in regulated activities, must apply for licensing as a mortgage banker or lender, loan servicer and debt collector pursuant to applicable state law. These state licensing requirements typically require an application process, the payment of fees, background checks and administrative review. Our servicing operations are licensed (or exempt or otherwise not required to be licensed) to service mortgage loans in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our consumer direct lending business is licensed to originate loans in 49 states and the District of Columbia. From time to time, we receive requests from states and Agencies and various investors for records, documents and information regarding our policies, procedures and practices regarding our loan production and loan servicing business activities, and undergo periodic examinations by federal and state regulatory agencies. We incur significant ongoing costs to comply with these licensing and examination requirements.
     While the U.S. federal government does not primarily regulate loan production, the federal Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (the “SAFE Act”) requires all states to enact laws that require all individuals acting in the United States as mortgage loan originators to be individually licensed or registered if they intend to offer mortgage loan products. These licensing requirements include enrollment in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System, application to state regulators for individual licenses, a minimum of 20 hours of pre‑licensing education, an annual minimum of eight hours of continuing education and the successful completion of both national and state exams.
     In addition to licensing requirements, we must comply with a number of federal consumer protection laws, including, among others:
    
· | the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which provides, among other things, interest and foreclosure protections for service members on active duty;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), and Regulation Z thereunder, which require certain disclosures to mortgagors regarding the terms of their mortgage loans, notices of sale, assignments or transfers of ownership of mortgage loans, new servicing rules involving payment processing, and adjustable rate mortgage change notices and periodic statements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”), and Regulation X thereunder, which require certain disclosures to mortgagors regarding the costs of mortgage loans, the administration of tax and insurance escrows, the transferring of servicing of mortgage loans, the response to consumer complaints, and payments between lenders and vendors of certain settlement services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V thereunder, which regulate the use and reporting of information related to the credit history of consumers;

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Many of these laws are further impacted by the SAFE Act and implementation of new rules by the CFPB under the Dodd‑Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”). 
     We are committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations and contractual agreements. We believe that compliance is best managed by integrating responsibility within each department’s activities to promote management and employee accountability. Accordingly, we have implemented a matrixed approach to the integration of our compliance program that utilizes expertise within the organization and defines clear responsibilities for the program; specifically, business units are responsible for defining and managing compliance performance through process‑based controls, risk remediation and reporting. Centralized monitoring and independent review, control testing, validation and regulation interpretation is performed by our Corporate Compliance, Legal, Quality Control, Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Audit groups.
     We have established a management Mortgage Regulatory Compliance Committee (“MRCC”) to oversee the compliance program, engender a culture conducive to ethical conduct and compliance throughout our Company, assure that we proactively identify and respond to changes in our risk profile and regulatory environment, and establish compliance program standards, articulated in compliance policies. The MRCC has identified individuals throughout the organization to oversee specific areas of compliance. MRCC membership includes senior management from across the Company and meets monthly to remain updated on recurring and rotational topics.

     We administer a compliance training program comprised of general training and role-centric training. Both are designed to promote a contemporary understanding of compliance issues and regulations affecting the mortgage industry.
     During 2016, our loan origination and servicing operations were reviewed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, FHA, the FDIC and by other state and federal regulators. There were no significant findings or allegations of violations of law from any of these reviews.
     Intellectual Property
     We hold registered trademarks with respect to the name PennyMac®, the swirl design and rooftop design appearing in certain PennyMac drawings and logos and various additional designs and word marks relating to the PennyMac name. We do not otherwise rely on any copyright, patent or other form of registration to protect our rights in our intellectual property. Our other intellectual property includes proprietary know‑how and technological innovations, such as our proprietary loan‑level analytics systems and models for distressed loan management, and other trade secrets that we have developed to maintain our competitive position.      Competition
     Given the diverse and specialized nature of our businesses, we do not believe we have a direct competitor for the totality of our business. We compete with a number of nationally‑focused companies in each of our businesses.
     In our mortgage banking segments, we compete with large financial institutions and with other independent residential mortgage loan producers and servicers, such as Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, U.S. Bank, Quicken Loans and Nationstar Mortgage. In our loan production segment, we compete on the basis of product offerings, technical knowledge, manufacturing quality, speed of execution, rate and fees. In our servicing segment, we compete on the basis of experience in the residential loan servicing business, quality of high‑touch special servicing and historical servicing performance, and quality of execution, especially in high‑touch special servicing.
     In our investment management segment, we compete for capital with both traditional and alternative investment managers. We compete on the basis of historical track record of risk‑adjusted returns, experience of investment management team, the return profile of prospective investment opportunities and on the level of fees and expenses.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2016, we, through a subsidiary, had 3,038 employees.
