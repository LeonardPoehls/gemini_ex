Aerospace and Defense 
Aerojet Rocketdyne is a world-recognized technology-based engineering and manufacturing company that develops and produces specialized propulsion systems, as well as armament systems. We develop and manufacture all four propulsion types (liquid, solid, air-breathing, and electric) for space, defense, civil and commercial applications. Principal customers and end users include the DoD, NASA, The Boeing Company (“Boeing”), Lockheed Martin Corporation (“Lockheed Martin”), Raytheon Company (“Raytheon”), and United Launch Alliance (“ULA”). 
Primary Markets and Programs 
The markets and key programs we serve are: 
Aerospace. We specialize in the development and production of propulsion systems for space applications and our products include a broad market offering of both chemical (liquid propellant engines and solid rocket motors) and electric propulsion required for launch vehicle and in-space applications in the defense, civil and commercial propulsion markets. 
Our space launch systems have a long, successful history with the DoD where we continue to project strong support related to National Security Space requirements enabling communications, navigation, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance activities. We provide booster and upper stage propulsion for ULA’s Delta IV and Atlas V launch vehicles in support of the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (“EELV”) program, as well as a limited number of Delta II vehicles which are supporting commercial customers launching earth observation spacecraft. 
During fiscal 2017, we achieved a number of significant milestones on the NASA Space Launch System (“SLS”) program. We made significant progress on our production restart and affordability activities on the RS-25 engines that will power the first SLS flight. Also, in our NASA business we completed the qualification of and delivered many of the propulsion subsystems for the Boeing Starliner vehicle which will support commercial manned services for NASA. In addition, the Lithium Ion batteries we developed as an upgrade to the International Space Station ("ISS") power system were delivered to the ISS in 2017 and are in full operation. 
We continued to mature critical technologies for our nation’s next generation of advanced hydrocarbon engines for future high-performance booster systems with the ability to eliminate the U.S. dependence on Russian-provided booster systems for National Security Space Launch. The U.S. Air Force awarded us an Other Transaction Agreement (“OTA”) that can provide up to $536 million of U.S. government funding in addition to our investment to qualify our AR1 engine. In fiscal 2017, we passed the AR1 Critical Design Review which represented a culmination of hundreds of development tests and manufacturing demonstrations. 
A critical new research and development effort secured in 2017 was the propulsion system to power the Boeing XSP advance reusable launcher. We will be adapting our RS-25 engine to this new strategic application that could significantly lower the cost of access to space. In addition, we were awarded several significant follow-on contracts in 2017 in the high power electric propulsion area to support both NASA’s human and scientific exploration goals. 
A subset of our key space programs include: RS-68, RS-27, and RL10 engines/boosters that power EELV launch vehicles, the AR1 large liquid engine for the next generation of launch vehicles, propulsion for the Orion human space capsule and the Starliner Commercial Crew Transportation Capability capsule, and multiple in-space electric and chemical propulsion systems to provide orbit raising and satellite station positioning.
Defense. We specialize in the development and production of propulsion systems for defense applications including armament systems for precision tactical systems and missile defense propulsion, tactical missile propulsion and hypersonic propulsion systems.
We develop and manufacture liquid and solid divert and attitude control ("DACs") propulsion systems and booster motors for missile defense applications. These are complex systems that provide multi-directional thrust and variable thrust levels to steer or control an intercept missile. Additionally, we develop and manufacture boost and post-boost rocket motors for strategic missiles. These systems provide launch capability and directional control for critical missile defense interceptors and for ground and sea-based strategic missiles.
We design, develop, and produce propulsion and warhead systems for tactical missiles. Our tactical products have been successfully fielded on numerous active U.S. and international weapon system platforms.
During fiscal 2017, we continued to expand our strong legacy propulsion franchises on the Standard Missile, Patriot Advanced Capability-3 ("PAC-3"), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ("THAAD") and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System ("GMLRS") missile propulsion systems. These franchise programs experienced backlog growth during 2017. 
As part of our Competitive Improvement Program ("CIP") in 2017, we completed validation of activity to move energetic production of the Standard Missile-3 DACs from our Sacramento, California facility to our Orange County, Virginia, facility. Also, the THAAD Boost Motor program energetic production moved from Sacramento, California, to our Camden, Arkansas production facility. These production consolidation activities in 2017 helped to reduce costs and strengthen competitiveness.
2

In a new and developing business arena, we were awarded a full-scale engineering development project for an advanced air-launched propulsion system that will transition to production. In the hypersonic propulsion technology area, we were awarded a contract for the Advanced Full Range Engine that will demonstrate reusable propulsion that can function from “takeoff” to Mach 5+. Finally, we initiated early development contract work in support of the nation’s future Ground Based Strategic Deterrent missile propulsion program.
Finally, our recently integrated Aerojet Rocketdyne Coleman Aerospace ("Coleman") business successfully delivered and supported flight of our extended-long-range air-launched ballistic missile target that is C-17 aircraft deployed. Coleman also continued to expand its scope on the Missile Defense Agency’s medium-range ballistic missile target program.
A subset of our key defense programs include: Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (“EKV”) Liquid DACs, booster and Liquid DACs for THAAD, boosters and solid DACs for the Navy’s Standard Missile family, PAC-3, GMLRS, HAWK, Javelin, Tactical Tomahawk, and Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wire-guided warhead. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
Leadership in Propulsion - For over 70 years, we have demonstrated a legacy of successfully meeting the most challenging missions by producing some of the world’s most technologically advanced propulsion systems for our customers. 
Diversified and Well Balanced Portfolio - We have been and continue to be a pioneer in the development of many enabling technologies and products that have strengthened multiple branches of the U.S. military and enabled the exploration of space. We believe Aerojet Rocketdyne maintains a unique competitive position due to a strategic focus on creating and maintaining a broad spectrum of propulsion and energetic products assisted by the growing market demand for its innovative energy management technologies. 
High Visibility of Revenue with Multi-year Contracts and Sizable Backlog - The highly visible nature of our revenue comes from the long-term nature of the programs with which we are involved, our diverse and attractive contract base and our deep customer relationships. A substantial portion of our sales are derived from multi-year contract awards from major aerospace and defense prime contractors. In many cases, we operate under sole source contracts, some of which are follow-on contracts to contracts initially competed years ago and others have been sole source contracts since inception. High renewal rates, supported by our market leading technology provide us with a highly stable business base from which to grow. As of December 31, 2017, our contract backlog (funded and unfunded) was $4.6 billion and our funded backlog, which includes only amounts for which funding has been authorized by a customer and a purchase order has been received, totaled $2.1 billion. 
Exceptional Long-Term Industry Relationships - We serve a broad set of customers and are major suppliers of propulsion products to top original equipment manufacturers such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and ULA, as well as to the DoD, NASA and other U.S. government agencies. We have a long history of partnering with their respective prime contractors and have developed close relationships with key decision-makers in the rocket and missile propulsion markets. We are, in many instances, approached by multiple prime contractors early in the bidding process, which is a testament to the strength of our relationships and technological leadership in the industry. 
Competition 
The competitive dynamics of our multi-faceted marketplace vary by product line and customer as we experience many of the same influences felt by the broader aerospace and defense industry.  The large majority of products we manufacture are highly complex, technically sophisticated and extremely hazardous to build, demanding rigorous manufacturing procedures and highly specialized manufacturing equipment.  While historically these factors, coupled with the high cost to establish the infrastructure required to meet these needs, posed substantial barriers to entry, modern design tools and manufacturing techniques (e.g., additive manufacturing) available to new entrants with the ability to self-fund start-up as well as development costs has led to increased competition in space related markets. To date, competition has been limited to a few participants who tend to be narrowly focused on products that are sub-elements of our overall product portfolio. For example, entrepreneurs such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, who have been or are in the process of developing liquid fuel propulsion capabilities are primarily focused on the development of space propulsion systems for heavy lift launch vehicles and are not pursuing or participating in the missile defense or tactical propulsion products that make up a substantial portion of our overall business. These new entrepreneurs have signaled their intent to compete primarily on price and are therefore bringing pressure to bear on existing cost paradigms and manufacturing methodologies.

Industry Overview 
Our primary aerospace and defense customers include the DoD and its agencies, NASA, and the prime contractors that supply products to these customers. We rely on U.S. government spending on aerospace and defense products and systems, and our backlog depends, in large part, on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we are involved. These funding levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of funding. Moreover, although our contracts often contemplate that our services will be performed over a period of several years, the U.S. Congress must appropriate funds for a given program and the U.S. President must sign into law such appropriations legislation each government fiscal year (“GFY”) and may significantly increase, decrease or eliminate, funding for a program. A decrease in DoD and/or NASA expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are or hope to be involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government outlays, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.
Congress was not able to pass full year appropriations for either DoD or NASA prior to the start of GFY 2017 on October 1, 2016, necessitating a short-term Continuing Resolution (“CR”) into December 2016.  After the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election in November 2016, Congress passed another CR into mid-2017 to allow the new Administration an opportunity to shape federal spending.  On May 5, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, an omnibus appropriations bill for GFY 2017, including appropriations for DoD and NASA; however, the delayed completion of the GFY2017 spending bills resulted in a delay to the release of the President’s Budget Request for GFY2018. With a truncated legislative cycle, Congress was unable to pass GFY 2018 appropriation bills before October 1, 2017, culminating in a series of CRs, with the latest through March 23, 2018. 
The SLS appears to remain a top Congressional priority as the CR included a provision to allow NASA the funding flexibility for SLS and deep exploration to remain on track. The SLS program also has enjoyed wide, bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress. We maintain a strong relationship with NASA and our propulsion systems have been powering NASA launch vehicles and spacecraft since the inception of the U.S. space program. Our booster, upper stage and Orion vehicle propulsion systems are currently baselined on the new SLS vehicle and both upper stage and booster engines are in development for future SLS variants. Due to the retirement of the space shuttle fleet, U.S. astronauts have been dependent on Russian Soyuz flights for access to and from the ISS for the better part of this decade. NASA has been working to re-establish U.S. manned space capability as soon as possible through development of a new “space taxi” to ferry astronauts and cargo to the ISS. In 2014, Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner capsule, powered by Aerojet Rocketdyne propulsion, was selected by NASA to transport astronauts to and from the ISS. As Boeing’s business partner, Aerojet Rocketdyne will be providing the propulsion system for this new capsule, thereby supplementing its work for NASA on the SLS designed for manned deep space exploration. In both instances, we have significant propulsion content and we look forward to supporting these programs for NASA.

Contract Types 
Research and development contracts are awarded during the inception stage of a program’s development. Production contracts provide for the production and delivery of mature products for operational use. Aerojet Rocketdyne’s contracts are largely categorized as either “fixed-price” (largely used by the U.S. government for production-type contracts) or “cost-reimbursable” (largely used by the U.S. government for development-type contracts). During fiscal 2017, approximately 60% of our net sales were from fixed-price contracts, 36% from cost-reimbursable contracts, and 4% from other sales including commercial contracts. 
Fixed-price contracts are typically (i) firm fixed-price, (ii) fixed-price-incentive fee, or (iii) fixed-price level of effort contracts. For firm fixed-price contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne performs work for a fixed price and realizes all of the profit or loss resulting from variations in costs during contract performance. For fixed-price-incentive fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne receives increased or decreased fees or profits based upon actual performance against established targets or other criteria. For fixed-price level of effort contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne generally receives a structured fixed price per labor hour, dependent upon the customer’s labor hour needs. All fixed-price contracts present the risk of unreimbursed cost overruns potentially resulting in lower than expected contract profit margin and losses. 
Cost-reimbursable contracts are typically (i) cost plus fixed fee, (ii) cost plus incentive fee, or (iii) cost plus award fee contracts. For cost plus fixed fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne typically receives reimbursement of its costs, to the extent the costs are allowable under contractual and regulatory provisions, in addition to receiving a fixed fee. For cost plus incentive fee contracts and cost plus award fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne receives adjustments to the contract fee, within designated limits, based on actual results as compared with contractual targets for factors such as cost, performance, quality, and schedule. 
In addition, OTA contracts are becoming more prevalent in initial phases of U.S. government procurements. An OTA is a special vehicle used by federal agencies for obtaining or advancing research and development or prototypes. The U.S. government's procurement regulations and certain procurement statutes do not apply to OTAs, and accordingly, other transaction authority gives agencies the flexibility necessary to develop agreements tailored to a particular transaction. Our sales and backlog figures do not include work we have under contracts obligated by the customer under an OTA. See our discussion below under "Research and Development" on our OTA with the U.S. Air Force in a public-private partnership to jointly develop the AR1 engine.
Some programs under contract have product life cycles exceeding ten years. It is typical for U.S. government propulsion contracts to be of relatively small contract value during development phases that can last from two to five years, followed by low-rate and then full-rate production, where annual funding can grow significantly. 
Government Contracts and Regulations 
U.S. government contracts generally are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations (“FAR”), agency-specific regulations that supplement FAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to U.S. government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustments, mandatory disclosure, and audit requirements. Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, inability to bill and collect receivables from customers, and the assessment of penalties and fines that could lead to suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting. In addition, as a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to routine audits, reviews, and investigations by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (“DCAA”), the Defense Contract Management Agency, and other similar U.S. government agencies. Such reviews include but are not limited to our contract performance, compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards as well as the review of the adequacy of our accounting systems, purchasing systems, property management systems, estimating systems, earned value management systems, and material management and accounting systems. 
The U.S. government’s ability to unilaterally modify or terminate a contract or to discontinue funding for a particular program at any time could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. The cancellation of a contract, if terminated for cause, could also subject us to liability for the excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source. If terminated for convenience, our recovery of costs would be limited to amounts already incurred or committed (including severance costs for terminated employees), and our profit would be limited based on the work completed prior to termination. 
Additional information about the risks relating to government contracts and regulations appears in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Report.

Seasonality 
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business is not subject to predictable seasonality. Primary factors affecting the timing of our sales include the timing of U.S. government awards, the availability of U.S. government funding, contractual product delivery requirements, and customer acceptances. 
Research and Development ("R&D")
We view R&D efforts as critical to maintaining our leadership position in markets in which we compete. Our R&D is primarily supported by customer funding. 
Our company-funded R&D efforts include expenditures for technical activities that are vital to the development of new products, services, processes or techniques, as well as those expenses for significant improvements to existing products or processes. 
Our R&D expenditures for the periods presented were as follows: 
 | Year Ended | | One month ended
 | December 31, | | December 31, | | November 30, | | December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2015 
 | (In millions) | | 
Customer-sponsored | $ | 561.1 | | | $ | 513.0 | | $ | 485.8 | $ | 33.7
Company-sponsored | 44.6 | | | 43.0 | | | 74.4 | | 4.6 
Total R&D expenditures | $ | 605.7 | | | $ | 556.0 | | $ | 560.2 | $ | 38.3

The Company-sponsored R&D expenditures in fiscal 2017, 2016, 2015, and the one month ended December 31, 2015 included $16.8 million, $20.5 million, $48.2 million, and $2.7 million, respectively, of AR1 R&D expenses, see discussion below.
AR1 
In February 2016, pursuant to an OTA, the U.S. Air Force selected Aerojet Rocketdyne and ULA to share in a public-private partnership to develop jointly the AR1 engine. The total agreement is valued at $804.0 million with the U.S. Air Force investing two-thirds of the funding required to complete development of the AR1 engine by 2019, and is being conducted in four phases, with each being an option to progress the project at pre-defined decision points. The work is expected to be completed no later than December 31, 2019. Through December 31, 2017, the U.S. Air Force has obligated $174.0 million with Aerojet Rocketdyne contributing $77.3 million and ULA contributing $6.1 million in cash and $3.6 million in "in-kind" R&D expenses. On February 1, 2018, the U.S. Air Force authorized phase two of the program, which obligates the U.S. Air Force to an additional $95.5 million and Aerojet Rocketdyne and ULA to an additional $47.8 million. The total potential investment by Aerojet Rocketdyne and its partners, if all options are exercised, is $268.0 million. The U.S. Air Force contributions are recognized proportionately as an offset to R&D expenses. The AR1 inception to date project costs at December 31, 2017, were as follows (in millions):

AR1 R&D costs incurred | $ | 245.6
Less amounts funded by the U.S. Air Force | (147.7 | ) 
Less amounts funded by ULA | (9.7 | ) 
AR1 R&D costs net of reimbursements | $ | 88.2 

Of the $88.2 million AR1 investment, $32.1 million was expensed and $56.1 million was applied to our contracts. 
Suppliers and Raw Materials 
The national aerospace supply base continues to consolidate due to economic, environmental, and marketplace circumstances beyond our control. The loss of key qualified suppliers of technologies, components, and materials can cause significant disruption to our program performance and cost. 
 Availability of raw materials and supplies has been generally sufficient. We sometimes are dependent, for a variety of reasons, upon sole-source or qualified suppliers and have, in some instances in the past, experienced difficulties meeting production and delivery obligations because of delays in delivery or reliance on such suppliers. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, we are often required to procure materials from certain suppliers capable of meeting rigorous customer and government specifications. 
6

The supply of ammonium perchlorate, a principal raw material used in solid propellant, is limited to a domestic independent single source that supplies the majority of the domestic solid propellant industry and actual pricing is based on the total industry demand. In the majority of our contracts, we anticipated this price increase and incorporated abnormal escalation pricing language into our proposals and contracts. 
We are also impacted, as is the rest of the industry, by fluctuations in the sustained availability, prices and lead-times of raw materials used in production on various fixed-price contracts, particularly on multi-year programs. We continue to experience volatility in the price and lead-times of certain commodity metals, electronic components, and constituent chemicals. An emerging challenge to the extended supply chain is the regulatory requirements to comply with stringent cyber security regulations that may influence the cost of materials and services on U.S. government contracts. We are actively working to identify these costs to obtain protection in our contracts.
Additional information about the risks relating to suppliers and raw materials appears in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Report. 
Intellectual Property 
Where appropriate, Aerojet Rocketdyne obtains patents in the U.S. and other countries for new and useful processes, machines, manufactures or compositions of matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof relating to its products and services. We use patents selectively to protect from an unauthorized third party making, using, selling, offering to sell and importing the claimed inventions of the patents. Our patents are maintained through the statutory limit of time, which is typically 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application, where the claimed invention has value in the markets in which we compete. We rely on trade secret protection for financial, technical and personnel information that provides an economic competitive advantage by virtue of not being known by the relevant public. If properly protected, trade secrets can be maintained in perpetuity. Aerojet Rocketdyne takes reasonable steps to prevent disclosure of its trade secrets in order to maintain protection under applicable state and federal laws. As our products and services typically embody complex systems that include many technologies, no single patent or trade secret is material to us.
Real Estate 
We own 11,451 acres of land adjacent to U.S. Highway 50 between Rancho Cordova and Folsom, California east of Sacramento (“Sacramento Land”). Acquired in the early 1950s for our aerospace and defense operations, large portions were used solely to provide safe buffer zones around hazardous operations. Modern changes in propulsion technology coupled with the relocation of certain of our propulsion operations led us to determine large portions of the Sacramento Land were no longer needed for operations. Consequently, our plan has been to re-entitle the Sacramento Land for new uses and explore various opportunities to optimize its value.
The Sacramento Land is made up of 5,203 acres used for our aerospace and defense operations, 685 acres available for future entitlement, and 5,563 acres for future development under the brand name “Easton”. Easton has 3,904 acres that are fully entitled. The term “entitlement” is generally used to denote the required set of regulatory approvals required to allow land to be zoned for new requested uses. Required regulatory approvals vary with each jurisdiction and each zoning proposal and may include permits, land use master plans, zoning designations, state and federal environmental documentation, and other regulatory approvals unique to the land. The entitlement and development process in California is long and uncertain with approvals required from various authorities, including local jurisdictions, and in select projects, permits required by federal agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, and others prior to construction. 
As Easton continues to execute re-entitlement and pre-development activities, we are pursuing all monetization options and are exploring how to maximize value from Easton. Value creation and monetization may include outright land sales and/or joint ventures with real estate developers, residential builders, and/or other third parties. The new housing market and local economy in the Sacramento region are in recovery, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe the long-term prospect for the Sacramento region represents an attractive and affordable alternative to the San Francisco Bay Area and other large metropolitan areas of California.

_________

(1) | Indicates land subject to restrictions imposed by state and/or federal regulatory agencies because of our historical propulsion system testing and manufacturing activities. We are actively working with the various regulatory agencies to have the restrictions removed as early as practicable, and the solutions to use these lands within Easton have been accounted for in the various land use plans and granted entitlements. See Note 8(c) in notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the federal and/or state environmental restrictions affecting portions of the Sacramento Land.

(2) The remaining 148 acres designated in Hillsborough will be transferred, per the completed purchase and sale contract, when the required environmental remediation work is completed. See Note 1(t) of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

(3) | We believe that the operations land is adequate for our long-term needs.


(4) | We believe it will be several years before any of this excess Sacramento Land is available for future change in entitlement. Some of this excess land is outside the current Urban Services Boundary established by the County of Sacramento and all of it is far from existing infrastructure, making it uneconomical to pursue entitlement for this land at this time.

Leasing & Other Real Estate 
We currently lease approximately 0.4 million square feet of office space in Sacramento to various third parties. These leasing activities generated $6.4 million in revenue in fiscal 2017. 
We also own approximately 580 acres of land in Chino Hills, California. This property was used for the manufacture and testing of ordnance. With the sale of our ordnance business in the mid-1990s, we closed this facility and commenced clean-up of the site. We continue to work with state regulators and the City of Chino Hills to complete those efforts. 
Environmental Matters 
Our current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. Our policy is to conduct our business with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We continually assess compliance with these regulations, and we believe our current operations are materially in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
On January 12, 1999, Aerojet Rocketdyne and the U.S. government reached a settlement agreement (“Global Settlement”) which established a cost-sharing ratio with respect to the cleanup costs of prior environmental contamination. Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of our Electronics and Information Systems ("EIS") business in 2001, we entered into an agreement with Northrop (the “Northrop Agreement”) whereby Aerojet Rocketdyne is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental expenditures eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to an annual and a cumulative limitation.
Operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal, recurring part of operations. Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these future costs are allowed to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government. 
Allowable environmental costs are charged to our contracts as the costs are incurred. Because these costs are recovered through forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet Rocketdyne to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on Aerojet Rocketdyne’s sustained business volume from U.S. government contracts and programs.

The inclusion of environmental costs in our contracts with the U.S. government impacts our competitive pricing; however, we believe that this impact is mitigated by driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations as well as our ability to deliver innovative and quality products to our customers.
Under existing U.S. environmental laws, Potentially Responsible Parties (“PRPs”), are jointly and severally liable, and therefore we are potentially liable to the U.S. government or other third parties for the full cost of remediating the contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites where we have been designated as a PRP by the EPA or state environmental agencies. The nature of environmental investigation and cleanup activities requires significant management judgment to determine the timing and amount of any estimated future costs that may be required for remediation measures. Further, environmental standards change from time to time. However, we perform quarterly reviews of these matters and accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability, usually based on proportionate sharing, can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities have not been discounted to their present value as the amounts and timing of cash payments are not fixed or reliably determinable. 
We did not incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in fiscal 2017 nor do we anticipate any material capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 and 2019. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis in Part II, Item 7 “Environmental Matters” of this Report for additional information. 
Additional information on the risks related to environmental matters can be found under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Report, including the material effects on compliance with environmental regulations that may impact our competitive position and operating results. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2017, 14% of our 5,157 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Significant collective bargaining agreements are due to expire in the fall of 2018. We believe that our relations with our employees and unions are good.
