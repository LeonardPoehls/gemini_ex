Operating Segments 
As of December 31, 2016, we had three operating segments: (i) Market Making, (ii) Global Execution Services, and (iii) Corporate and Other. 

• | Market Making - Our Market Making segment principally consists of market making in the cash, futures and options markets across global equities, options, fixed income, currencies and commodities. As a market maker, we commit capital on a principal basis by offering to buy securities from, or sell securities to, broker dealers, banks and institutions. We engage in principal trading in the Market Making segment direct to clients as well as in a supplemental capacity on exchanges, electronic communications networks (“ECNs”) and alternative trading systems (“ATSs”). We are an active participant on all major global equity and futures exchanges and we also trade on substantially all domestic electronic options exchanges. As a complement to electronic market making, our cash trading business handles specialized orders and also transacts on the OTC Bulletin Board marketplaces operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc. and the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange ("AIM").


• | Global Execution Services - Our Global Execution Services segment comprises agency-based trading and trading venues, offering execution services in global equities, options, futures and fixed income on behalf of institutions, banks and broker dealers. We earn commissions as an agent on behalf of clients as well as between principals to transactions; in addition, we will commit capital on behalf of clients as needed. Agency-based, execution-only trading in the segment is done primarily through a variety of access points including: (i) algorithmic trading and order routing in global equities and options; (ii) institutional sales traders executing program, block and riskless principal trades in global equities and exchange traded funds ("ETFs"); (iii) a fixed income ECN that also offers trading applications; and (iv) an ATS for U.S. equities.

In September 2016, we completed the acquisition of Neonet Securities AB ("Neonet"). Neonet is an independent agency broker and execution specialist based in Stockholm, Sweden. The results of Neonet, beginning on the date of acquisition, are included in this segment.

• | Corporate and Other - Our Corporate and Other segment contains our investments, principally in strategic trading-related opportunities; manages the deployment of capital across the organization; houses executive management functions; and maintains corporate overhead expenses and all other income and expenses that are not attributable to our other segments. Our Corporate and Other segment also contains functions that support the Company’s other segments such as self-clearing services, including stock lending activities.

Management from time to time conducts a strategic review of our businesses and evaluates their potential value in the marketplace relative to their current and expected returns. To the extent management and our Board of Directors determine that the disposal of a business may return a higher value to stockholders, or that the business is no longer core to our strategy, the Company may divest or exit such business. 
In November 2014, we sold certain assets and liabilities related to our Futures Commission Merchant ("FCM ") business to Wedbush Securities Inc.
In March 2015, we sold KCG Hotspot, our institutional spot foreign exchange ECN, to Bats Global Markets, Inc. (“Bats”). 
The results of the FCM and KCG Hotspot, including the gains on sale, are included in the Global Execution Services segment, up through the dates of their respective sales.
During the fourth quarter of 2015, management conducted a strategic review of our businesses and evaluated their potential value in the marketplace relative to their current and expected returns. As a result of this review, we determined that certain of our businesses, including our business as an equities designated market maker ("DMM") on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), were no longer considered core to our strategy, and we began seeking opportunities to exit or divest of these businesses. We believe that this course of action did not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results, but did meet the requirements to be considered held for sale at December 31, 2015 and for assets of businesses not yet sold, which comprises a technology platform, continue to meet such requirements as of December 31, 2016. The fair value of such assets, of $8.2 million and $26.0 million, on December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, are included within Assets of businesses held for sale on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
In March 2016, we completed the sale of assets related to our retail U.S. options market making business.
5

In May 2016, we completed the sale of our DMM business to Citadel Securities LLC (“Citadel”).
The results of both the retail U.S. options market making business and the DMM business are included in the Market Making segment, up through the date of the respective sales.
See Footnote 3 "Discontinued Operations, Assets of Businesses Held for Sale & Sales of Businesses" to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the presentation of these businesses in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Market Making Segment 
Business Segment Overview 
We make markets primarily in global equities, futures, options, fixed income, currencies and commodities. We are an active participant on all major global equity and futures exchanges. As a market maker, we commit capital on a principal basis by offering to buy securities from, or sell securities to, broker dealers, banks and institutions. We engage in principal trading in the Market Making segment direct to clients as well as in a supplemental capacity in equity securities quoted and traded on the NYSE, Nasdaq Stock Market, OTC market, NYSE MKT, NYSE Arca and several European and Asian exchanges. We are connected to a large number of external market centers including exchanges, ECNs, ATSs, dark liquidity pools, alternative display facilities (“ADF”), multilateral trading facilities (“MTF”) and other broker dealers.
The majority of revenues for this segment are derived from direct-to-client market making in U.S. equities. As a complement, our cash trading business handles specialized orders and also transacts on the OTC Bulletin Board, marketplaces operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc., and the AIM.
The majority of market making activity is conducted on a principal basis through the use of automated quantitative models. We derive revenues from the difference between the amount paid when securities are bought and the amount received when the securities are sold. In supplemental, exchange-based market making, we generally derive revenues from pricing and arbitrage opportunities from financial instruments within the marketplace.
6

Clients and Products 
We offer direct-to-client market making services across multiple asset classes primarily to sell-side clients including global, national and regional broker dealers and banks as well as buy-side clients comprising, among others, mutual funds, pension plans, plan sponsors, hedge funds, trusts and endowments in North America, Europe and Asia. In 2016, we did not have any client that accounted for more than 10% of Market Making segment revenues.
In this segment, we generally compete based on execution quality, market coverage, payment for order flow, fulfillment rates and client service. In direct-to-client electronic market making in U.S. equities, execution quality is generally accepted as speed, spread and price improvement under SEC Rule 605. In other asset classes, standards for execution quality are client defined. In non-client exchange-based market making, the Company seeks to provide best prices for buy and sell orders on market centers throughout the day and competes with proprietary trading firms based on, among other things, speed and price.
We continually work to provide clients with high quality, low-cost trade executions that enable them to satisfy their fiduciary obligation to seek the best execution on behalf of the end client. We continually refine our automated quantitative models so that we may remain competitive.
Global Execution Services Segment 
Business Segment Overview 
We provide agency execution services and trading venues for agency-based, execution-only trading in global equities, fixed income, futures and options to institutions, banks and broker dealers. We are an active participant on all major global equity, futures and options exchanges. We generally earn commissions and commission-equivalents as an agent between principals for transactions, however, we will commit capital on behalf of clients as needed. We are connected to a large number of external market centers including exchanges, ECNs, ATSs, dark liquidity pools, ADFs, MTFs and other broker dealers.
The majority of revenues for this segment are derived from agency-based, execution-only trading encompassing algorithmic trading and order routing in global equities; institutional sales traders executing program, block and riskless principal trades in global equities and ETFs; a fixed income ECN that also offers trading applications ("KCG BondPoint"); and an ATS for U.S. equities ("KCG MatchIt").
Clients and Products 
We offer agency execution services and trading venues across multiple asset classes to buy-side clients including mutual funds, pension plans, plan sponsors, hedge funds, trusts and endowments and sell-side clients including global, national and regional broker dealers and banks in North America, Europe and Asia. In 2016, our Global Execution Services segment did not have any client that accounted for more than 10% of our commissions earned.
In this segment, we generally compete on trading costs, client service, market coverage, liquidity, platform capabilities and anonymity. We draw on in-house developed advanced trading technologies to meet client criteria for best execution and for managing trading costs. As a result, we are able to attract a diverse array of clients in terms of strategy, size and style. We also provide algorithmic trading and order routing that combine advanced technology, access to our differentiated liquidity and support from experienced professionals to help clients execute trades.
Through KCG Electronic Trading, we offer electronic execution services in global equities, options, futures and commodities via algorithmic trading, order routing and an execution management system ("EMS") as well as internal crossing through our registered ATS. Our ATS provides clients with an anonymous source of non-displayed liquidity.
This segment also offers clients a broad range of products and services and voice access to global markets including sales and trading for equities, ETFs and options. Additionally, we provide buy-side clients with deep liquidity, actionable market insights, anonymity and trade executions with minimal market impact and offer comprehensive trade execution services covering the depth and breadth of the market. We handle large complex trades, accessing liquidity from our order flow and other sources. We also provide soft dollar and commission recapture programs.
KCG BondPoint provides electronic fixed income trading solutions to buy-side and sell-side firms via a fixed income ECN that serves as an electronic inter-dealer system and allows clients to access live and executable retail-sized offerings in corporate bonds, municipals, government agency, treasuries and certificates of deposits. KCG BondPoint also provides front-end applications for brokers and advisors as well as a trading application for traders.
7

Corporate and Other Segment 
Our Corporate and Other segment manages the deployment of capital across the organization; houses executive management functions; contains our investments, principally in strategic trading-related opportunities; and maintains corporate overhead expenses and all other income and expenses that are not attributable to our other segments. Our Corporate and Other segment contains functions that support our other segments, such as self-clearing services, and stock lending activities.
Our Corporate and Other segment’s revenues include returns from strategic investments, interest income from cash balances and treasury investments and other income. Operating expenses primarily consist of compensation for certain senior executives and support employees, legal and other professional fees related to corporate matters, directors’ fees, investor and public relations expenses and directors’ and officers’ insurance.
Competition 
Our client offerings, encompassing direct-to-client market making, agency execution services and trading venues, compete primarily with similar products offered by domestic and international broker dealers, exchanges, ATSs, crossing networks, ECNs and dark liquidity pools. Supplemental, exchange-based market making competes with various market participants including proprietary trading firms that utilize highly automated, electronic trading models. Another source of competition is broker dealers who execute portions of their client flow through internal market-making desks rather than sending the client flow to third party execution destinations, such as KCG.
Our Market Making segment competes primarily on the basis of execution quality (including price, liquidity, speed and other client-defined measures), client relationships, client service, payments for order flow and technology. Over the past several years, regulatory changes, competition and the continued focus by regulators and investors on execution quality and overall transaction costs have resulted in a market environment characterized by narrowed spreads and reduced revenue capture. Consequently, maintaining profitability has become extremely challenging for the industry. In general, improvements in execution quality, such as faster execution speed and greater price improvement, have negatively impacted the ability to derive profitability from executing client order flow. We have made, and continue to make, changes to our execution protocols and quantitative models, which have had, or could have, a significant impact on our profitability. To remain profitable, KCG and its industry competitors have limited or ceased activity in illiquid or marginally profitable securities or, conversely, have sought to execute a greater volume of trades at a lower cost by increasing the automation and efficiency of their operations.
Competition for order flow in the U.S. equity markets continues to be intense as reflected in publicly disclosed execution metrics, i.e., SEC Rules 605 and 606. These rules, applicable to broker dealers, add greater disclosure to execution quality and order-routing practices. Rule 605 requires market centers that trade national market system securities to make available to the public monthly electronic reports that include uniform statistical measures of execution quality on a security-by-security basis. These statistics vary by order sender based on their mix of business. Rule 606 requires broker dealers that route equity and option orders on behalf of their customers to make publicly available quarterly reports that describe their order routing practices and disclose the venues to which customer orders are routed for execution. This rule also requires the disclosure of payment for order flow arrangements and internalization practices. The intent of this rule is to encourage routing of order flow to destinations based primarily on the demonstrable quality of executions at those destinations, supported by the order entry firms’ fiduciary obligations to seek to obtain best execution for their customers’ orders. 
Our Global Execution Services segment competes with other electronic trading platforms for orders from institutional firms and, to a lesser extent, with sales and trading teams at larger firms. Competition for business with institutional clients is based on a variety of factors, including execution quality, research, soft dollar, commission sharing and recapture services, technology, market access (including direct market access and execution algorithms), client relationships, client service, cost, capital facilitation and reputation. 
We believe the trend toward increased competition and the growth of alternative trading venues will continue. We may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain greater market share by reducing prices. 
Infrastructure
We continue to invest significant resources to expand our execution capabilities, upgrade our trading systems and infrastructure and enhance and strengthen our controls. We plan to make additional investments in technology and infrastructure. We are continuing to identify duplicative systems and working to rationalize them in future 
8

architectures. Our ability to identify and deploy emerging technologies that facilitate the execution of trades, including developing and enhancing our quantitative client market making models and proprietary trading models is key to the successful execution of our business model. Technology has enhanced our capacity and ability to handle order flow faster and also has been an important component of our strategy to comply with government and industry regulations, achieve competitive execution standards, increase trading automation and provide superior client service. We continually enhance our use of technology and quantitative models to further refine our execution services, develop and enhance our non-client principal trading models and reduce trading costs.
We use our proprietary technology and technology licensed from third parties, among other items, to execute trades, manage risk, monitor the performance of our traders, assess our inventory positions and provide ongoing information to our clients. We are electronically linked to institutions and broker dealers to provide immediate access to our trading operations and facilitate the handling of client orders. Our business-to-business portal and KCG Acknowledge product suite, KCG MatchIt, KCG BondPoint and KCG Electronic Trading platforms along with our suites of algorithms, provide our clients with an array of tools to interact with our trading systems, multiple marketplaces throughout the globe and most U.S. equity, options, fixed income, currency and futures market centers.
We have developed a proprietary clearing platform in connection with our self-clearing activities and have leveraged technology as well as operations, finance, legal and compliance functions to support these activities. We self-clear substantially all of our domestic and international equity, ETF and equity option order flow.
Alternative trading and data center facilities are in place for our primary operations. These facilities have been designed to allow us to continue a substantial portion of our operations if we are prevented from accessing or utilizing our primary office locations for an extended period of time. While we take significant steps to develop, implement and maintain reasonable business continuity plans, we cannot guarantee that our alternative systems and facilities will provide full continuity of operations should a significant business disruption occur.
Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
Our success and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degree on our intellectual property, which includes our execution technology, quantitative client market making and non-client principal trading models and information regarding our client base. A large portion of our technology was developed internally, and we rely primarily on trade secret, trademark, copyright, domain name, patent, commercial and contract law to protect our intellectual property. It is our policy to enter into confidentiality, intellectual property, invention assignment, non-competition and non-solicitation agreements or restrictions with our employees, independent contractors and business partners and to control access to and the distribution of our intellectual property.
Government Regulation and Market Structure
Most aspects of our business are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state and international laws, rules and regulations. Regulators in the U.S. and international jurisdictions continue to promulgate numerous rules and regulations that may impact our business. In the U.S., these regulatory bodies include the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC"), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA"), National Futures Association ("NFA"), NYSE, NASDAQ, other SROs, and other regulatory bodies, such as state securities commissions and state attorneys general. In Europe and Asia, these regulatory bodies include, but are not limited to, the UK Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA"), the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (the “AMF”), the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (“SFSA”), the Singapore Exchange, the Securities and Exchange Board of India ("SEBI"), and the Australian Securities and Investment Commission ("ASIC"). In addition, we are subject to other laws and rules in the countries where we do business.
As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the financial markets and protecting the interests of investors by ensuring that trading on their markets is reliable, transparent, competitive, fair and orderly. Regulated entities, such as KCG, are subject to rules concerning all aspects of their business, including trade practices, best execution for customers, anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance, anti-bribery compliance, capital adequacy, record-keeping, technology implementation, risk management, supervision, and officer, supervisor and employee conduct. Failure to comply with any of these or any other laws, rules or regulations affecting our businesses could result in administrative actions or court proceedings, censures, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, loss of membership, injunctions or the suspension or disqualification of the entity and/or its officers, supervisors or employees.
The regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to constant review and change. Legislation and 
9

regulatory requirements and market structure changes have had and will in the future have an impact on KCG’s subsidiaries by directly affecting their method of operation and, at times, their profitability by imposing significant obligations and restraints on KCG and its affiliates. These increased obligations and restraints require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls, which have increased our costs and may subject us to regulatory inquiries, administrative actions, court proceedings, claims, disciplinary fines or penalties for non-compliance. In addition, future changes may require significant technological, operational and compliance costs associated with the obligations that derive from compliance with such laws, rules and regulations.
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was enacted in the U.S. Implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act continues to be accomplished through extensive rulemaking by the CFTC, SEC and other governmental agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act and rulemaking to implement this law have not had a material impact on our businesses, although we believe the legislation has had the effect of decreasing liquidity in the fixed income markets which indirectly affects market making in such securities. Further, it is possible, that future rulemaking or changes to the market structure and practices in response to the Dodd-Frank Act may impact our businesses.
The SEC and other regulatory bodies have enacted and are actively considering rules that may affect the operation and profitability of KCG. In particular, on November 15, 2016, the SEC voted to approve an NMS Plan to create a single, comprehensive database known as the Consolidated Audit Trail (“CAT”) to enable regulators to track all data relating to U.S. equity and options market activity. The CAT Plan was developed by the national securities exchanges and FINRA after the SEC directed them to submit a plan detailing how they would develop, implement, and maintain a consolidated audit trail. Among other things, the CAT Plan will impose substantial new reporting requirements and costs on broker dealers, such as KCG. In addition, on November 19, 2014, the SEC adopted Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity ("Regulation SCI"). Regulation SCI requires securities exchanges and broker dealer operators of alternative trading systems with significant volume to (1) establish and enforce written policies and procedures designed to ensure operational capabilities of technological systems, (2) take immediate remedial action and notify the SEC and those affected of system incidents, (3) conduct annual compliance reviews and industry or sector-wide business continuity testing, and (4) file periodic reports with the SEC. KCG's ATS may meet the volume thresholds and may be required to comply with Regulation SCI. The SEC has been considering whether an SCI-like framework should be developed for other key market participants, which could include KCG’s broader operations. 
On November 18, 2015, the SEC proposed amendments to Regulation ATS that would require alternative trading systems that trade NMS stocks, including “dark pools”, to publicly disclose detailed information about the operations of the ATS and the activities of the ATS operator and its affiliates. If implemented, the amendments to Regulation ATS will impose substantial new disclosure and reporting requirements on operators of NMS stock ATSs, such as KCG.
On April 6, 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor (the "DOL") issued a final rule under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) that establishes a fiduciary standard for any person who provides advice to retirement plans, plan sponsors, fiduciaries, plan participants, beneficiaries and IRAs and IRA owners (the “Fiduciary Rule”). The Fiduciary Rule, as drafted, would require changes to service delivery and compensation models for brokers, banks, investment advisers, insurance companies and consultants that work with individual retirement accounts and employee benefit plans. On February 3, 2017, an executive order was issued, requiring the Secretary of Labor to analyze certain potential consequences thereof. In addition, on February 10, 2017, the DOL issued a proposal to delay the effective date of the Fiduciary Rule for 180 days, which will be subject to a short comment period. It is therefore possible that the Fiduciary Rule may be delayed, revised or abandoned. However, given that certain institutions have made changes in expectation of the rule, certain impacts may be realized even if the Fiduciary Rule is delayed, revised or abandoned. The overall potential impact of the Fiduciary Rule on KCG is uncertain, but it could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
Regulators may also propose other market structure changes particularly considering the continued regulatory scrutiny of high frequency trading, alternative trading systems, market fragmentation, colocation, access to market data feeds, extreme market volatility, and remuneration arrangements such as payment for order flow and exchange fee structures.
However, notwithstanding the foregoing, with the expected departure of SEC Chair White and CFTC Chair Massad and the expected confirmation of a new Chairperson at each agency, the regulatory agendas of the SEC and CFTC may change dramatically. It is difficult to predict how changes to the agenda will affect current market structure initiatives and what new initiatives may be proposed.
10

The financial services industry in many countries is heavily regulated, much like in the U.S. The compliance requirements of these different regulatory jurisdictions and other factors may limit our ability to conduct business or expand internationally. For example, the review of Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ("MiFID"), which was implemented in November 2007, is nearing completion. Proposed changes to MiFID, which consist of a directive called MiFID 2 and regulations called MiFIR, were finalized in 2016, and the adoption of MiFID 2/MiFIR will include many changes likely to affect our businesses. For example, the changes will require firms like KCG and other market participants to conduct all trading on European markets through authorized investment firms. MiFID 2/MiFIR will also require market makers, including KCG, to post firm quotes at competitive prices and will supplement current requirements with regard to investment firms’ risk controls related to the safe operation of electronic systems. MiFID 2/MiFIR may also impose additional requirements on trading platforms on which we trade, such as circuit breakers, synchronization of business clocks and flagging of algorithms. The implementation of these new requirements is expected to be set for 2018 and may impose technological and compliance costs on KCG as a participant in those trading platforms.
The European Commission proposed a financial transaction tax ("FTT"). European Union member states, including Germany and Spain, have discussed the adoption of a FTT. The scope of instruments and transactions that may be covered by these FTTs is still under discussion, and it is, therefore, premature to determine the impact of such FTTs on KCG’s business. In addition to the European Commission's proposal, France and Italy have each separately adopted FTTs. These taxes have not had a material impact on our profitability, however, changes to or expansion of these FTTs or the adoption of any subsequent FTTs could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
For risks related to government regulation and market structure, see "Risk Factors - Regulatory and legal uncertainties could harm KCG's business" included in Part I, Item 1A herein.
Net Capital Requirements 
Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule or capital adequacy requirements by foreign regulators. These rules, which specify minimum net capital requirements for registered broker dealers, are designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a broker dealer and require that at least a minimum part of their assets be kept in relatively liquid form. In general, net capital is defined as net worth (assets minus liabilities), plus qualifying subordinated borrowings and certain discretionary liabilities, less certain mandatory deductions that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and from valuing conservatively certain other assets. Among these are deductions of non-allowable assets and adjustments, commonly called haircuts, which reflect the possibility of a decline in the fair value of an asset before disposition. 
Failure to maintain the required net capital may subject a firm to suspension or revocation of registration by the SEC, FCA or SFSA and suspension or expulsion by FINRA and other regulatory bodies, and ultimately could require the relevant entity’s liquidation. The Uniform Net Capital Rule prohibits payments of dividends, redemption of stock, the prepayment of subordinated indebtedness and the making of any unsecured advance or loan to a stockholder, employee or affiliate, if such payment would reduce the firm’s net capital below required levels. 
A change in the Uniform Net Capital Rule or other similar rules effected by foreign regulatory authorities, the imposition of new rules or any unusually large charges against net capital could limit our businesses that require the intensive use of capital and also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital from our broker dealer subsidiaries. A significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our present levels of business. 
For additional discussion related to net capital, see Footnote 22 “Net Capital Requirements” included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this document. 
Employees 
At December 31, 2016, our headcount was 952 full-time employees, compared to 1,006 full-time employees at December 31, 2015. The decrease in headcount from December 31, 2015 is primarily due to natural attrition and the sale of our DMM business offset, in part, by the acquisition of Neonet in September of 2016 and other new hires. Of our 952 full-time employees at December 31, 2016, 732 were employed in the U.S. and 220 outside the U.S., primarily in London. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
