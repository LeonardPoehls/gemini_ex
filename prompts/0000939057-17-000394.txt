General
Anchor Bancorp, a Washington corporation, was formed for the purpose of becoming the bank holding company for Anchor Bank in connection with the Bank’s conversion from mutual to stock form, which was completed on January 25, 2011.  In connection with the mutual to stock conversion, the Bank changed its name from “Anchor Mutual Savings Bank” to “Anchor Bank.”  At June 30, 2017, we had total assets of $462.5 million, total deposits of $345.2 million and total stockholders' equity of $65.9 million.  Anchor Bancorp’s business activities generally are limited to passive investment activities and oversight of its investment in Anchor Bank.  Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including consolidated financial statements and related data, relates primarily to Anchor Bank.
Anchor Bancorp is a bank holding company and is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”).  Anchor Bank is examined and regulated by the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions, Division of Banks (“DFI”) and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).  Anchor Bank is required to have certain reserves set by the Federal Reserve and is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (“FHLB” or “FHLB of Des Moines”), which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System (“FHLB System”).

We are in the business of attracting deposits from the public and utilizing those deposits to originate loans. We offer a wide range of loan products to meet the demands of our customers, however, at June 30, 2017, 91.8% of our loans were collateralized by real estate and 65.7% of our loans were collateralized by commercial and multi-family real estate. Historically, our principal lending activity has consisted of the origination of loans secured by first mortgages on owner-occupied, one-to-four family residences and loans for the construction of one-to-four family residences, as well as consumer loans, with an emphasis on home equity loans and lines of credit. Since 1990, we have been actively offering commercial real estate loans and multi-family loans primarily in Western Washington. 
On April 11, 2017, Washington Federal entered into the merger agreement with the Company. The merger agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Company will merge with and into Washington Federal with Washington Federal as the surviving corporation in the merger.

Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Lending.   As of June 30, 2017, $216.0 million, or 56.4% of our total loan portfolio was secured by commercial and multi-family real estate property located in our market area.  Of this amount, $43.9 million was identified as owner occupied commercial real estate, and the remaining $172.1 million, or 44.9% of our total loan portfolio was secured by income producing, or non-owner occupied commercial real estate. Our commercial real estate loans include loans secured by properties classified as office, hospitality, mini storage, mobile home park, congregate care, retail, education/worship, airport parking lot and other non-residential. As of June 30, 2017, commercial real estate loans totaled $155.5 million, or 40.6% of our portfolio. Multi-family real estate totaled $60.5 million, or 15.8% of our portfolio at June 30, 2017. 
Commercial real estate and multi-family loans generally are priced at a higher rate of interest than one-to-four family loans. Typically, these loans have higher loan balances, are more difficult to evaluate and monitor, and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family loans. Often payments on loans secured by commercial or multi-family properties are dependent on the successful operation and management of the property; therefore, repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. We generally require and obtain loan guarantees from financially capable parties based upon the review of personal financial statements. If the borrower is a corporation, we generally require and obtain personal guarantees from the corporate principals based upon a review of their personal financial statements and individual credit reports.
The average loan size in our commercial and multi-family real estate portfolio was $920,000 as of June 30, 2017.  We target individual commercial and multi-family real estate loans to small and mid-size owner occupants and investors in our market area, between $1.0 million and $6.0 million. At June 30, 2017, the largest commercial real estate loan in our portfolio was a loan of $11.0 million secured by a hotel located in DuPont, Washington. Our largest multi-family loan as of June 30, 2017, was an $8.1 million loan is secured by a 65 unit apartment complex located in Seattle, Washington.
We offer both fixed and adjustable rates on commercial and multi-family real estate loans. Loans originated on a fixed rate basis generally are originated at terms up to ten years, with amortization terms up to 30 years. A substantial amount of our commercial and multi-family real estate loans have adjustable interest rates. As a result, these loans may experience a higher rate of default in a rising interest rate environment. As of June 30, 2017, we had $29.6 million and $30.9 million in fixed and adjustable rate multi-family loans, respectively, and $19.0 million and $136.5 million in fixed and adjustable rate commercial real estate loans, respectively.
Commercial and multi-family real estate loans are originated with rates that generally adjust after an initial period ranging from three to ten years. Adjustable rate multi-family and commercial real estate loans are generally priced utilizing the applicable FHLB or U.S. Treasury Term Borrowing Rate plus an acceptable margin. These loans are typically amortized for up to 30 years with a prepayment penalty.  The maximum loan-to-value ratio for commercial and multi-family real estate loans is generally 75%.  We require appraisals of all properties securing commercial and multi-family real estate loans, performed by independent appraisers designated by us.  We require our commercial and multi-family real estate loan borrowers with outstanding balances in excess of $750,000, or a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 60% to submit annual financial statements and rent rolls on the subject property.  The 
6

properties that fit within this profile are also inspected annually, and an inspection report and photograph are included.  We generally require a minimum pro forma debt coverage ratio of 1.20 times for loans secured by commercial and multi-family properties.
The following is an analysis of the types of collateral securing our commercial real estate and multi-family loans at June 30, 2017:

Collateral | Amount | | Percent ofTotal
 | (Dollars in thousands)
Multi-family | $ | 60,500 | | | 28.0 | %
Office | 17,632 | | | 8.2 | 
Hospitality | 31,689 | | | 14.7 |

Total | $ | 216,025 | | | 100.0 | %

If we foreclose on a multi-family or commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for one-to-four family mortgage loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Additionally, as a result of our increasing emphasis on this type of lending, a portion of our multi-family and commercial real estate loan portfolio is relatively unseasoned and has not been subjected to unfavorable economic conditions. As a result, we may not have enough payment history with which to judge future collectability or to predict the future performance of this part of our loan portfolio. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our historical experience, which could adversely affect our future performance. Further, our multi-family and commercial real estate loans generally have relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our commercial real estate loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios. At June 30, 2017, there was one commercial real estate loan for $2.0 million and no multi-family loans that were on nonaccrual status.  Commercial real estate loan charge offs for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were $110,000 and $225,000, respectively. There were no multi-family loans charged-off for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. 
One-to-Four Family Real Estate Lending. As of June 30, 2017, $59.7 million, or 15.6%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of permanent loans secured by one-to-four family residences of which $1.2 million were nonperforming. We originate both fixed rate and adjustable rate loans in our residential lending program and use Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") underwriting guidelines.  None of our residential loan products allow for negative amortization of principal.  We typically base our decision on whether to sell or retain secondary market quality loans on the rate and fees for each loan, market conditions and liquidity needs.  Although we have sold the majority of our residential loans over the last two years, we do not sell all qualified loans on the secondary market as we hold in our portfolio many residential loans that may not meet all of Freddie Mac's guidelines yet meet our investment and liquidity objectives.  
At June 30, 2017, $35.6 million of this loan portfolio consisted of fixed rate loans which were 59.5% of our total one-to-four family portfolio and 9.3% of our total loans at that date. Specifically, we offer fixed rate, residential mortgages from 10 to 30 year terms and we use Freddie Mac daily pricing to set our pricing.  Borrowers have a variety of buy-down options with each loan and most mortgages have a duration of less than ten years.  The average loan duration is a function of several factors, including real estate supply and demand, current interest rates, expected future rates and interest rates payable on outstanding loans.
Additionally, we offer a full range of adjustable rate mortgage products.  These loans offer three, five or seven year fixed-rate terms with annual adjustments thereafter.  The annual adjustments are limited to increases or decreases of no more than two percent and carry a typical lifetime cap of five percent above the original rate.  At this time, we hold these adjustable rate mortgages in our portfolio.  Similar to fixed rate loans, borrower demand for adjustable rate mortgage loans is a function of the current rate environment, the expectations of future interest rates and the difference between the initial interest rates and fees charged for each type of loan. The relative amount of fixed rate mortgage loans and adjustable rate mortgage loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment.

While adjustable rate mortgages in our loan portfolio help us reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, it is possible that, during periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on adjustable rate mortgage loans may increase as a result of annual repricing and the subsequent higher payment to the borrower.  In some rate environments, adjustable rate mortgages may be offered at initial rates of interest below a comparable fixed rate and could result in a higher risk of default or delinquency. Another consideration is that although adjustable rate mortgage loans allow us to decrease the sensitivity of our asset base as a result of changes in the interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits. Our historical experience with adjustable rate mortgages has been very favorable.  We do not, however, offer adjustable rate mortgages with initial teaser rates.  At June 30, 2017, $24.2 million of our permanent one-to-four family mortgage loans were adjustable rate loans which were 40.5% of our total one-to-four family loan portfolio and 6.3% of our total loans at that date.
Regardless of the type of loan, we underwrite our residential loans based on Freddie Mac's Loan Prospector guidelines.  This underwriting considers a variety of factors such as credit history, debt to income, property type, loan-to-value, and occupancy, to name a few.  Generally, we use the same Freddie Mac criteria for establishing maximum loan-to-values and also consider whether a transaction is a purchase, rate and term refinance, or cash-out refinance. For loans above 80% loan-to-value, we typically require private mortgage insurance in order to reduce our risk exposure should the loan default.  Regardless of the loan-to-value, our one-to-four family loans are appraised by independent fee appraisers that have been approved by us and generally carry no prepayment restrictions. We also require title insurance, hazard insurance, and if necessary, flood insurance in an amount not less than the current regulatory requirements.
We also have additional products designed to make home ownership available to qualified low to moderate income borrowers. The underwriting guidelines for these programs are usually more flexible in the areas of credit or work history.  For example, some segments of the low to moderate income population have non-traditional credit histories and pay cash for many of their consumer purchases.  They may also work in seasonal industries that do not offer a standard work schedule or salary.  Loans such as Freddie Mac's “Homestart Program” are designed to meet this market's needs and often require a borrower to show a history of saving and budgeting. These types of programs also provide education on the costs and benefits of homeownership.  We plan on continuing to offer these and other programs which reach out to qualifying borrowers in all the markets we serve.
Anchor Bank does not actively engage in subprime lending, either through advertising, marketing, underwriting and/or risk selection, and has no established program to originate or purchase subprime loans to be held in its portfolio.  Residential mortgage loans identified as subprime, with FICO scores of less than 660, were originated and managed in the ordinary course of business, and totaled $3.6 million at June 30, 2017, representing 0.9% of total loans, 5.6% of one-to-four family mortgage loans, and 5.6% of Tier 1 Capital.  Our weighted average seasoning for these loans (the number of months since the funding date of the loans) was 91 months as of June 30, 2017. Our one-to-four family mortgage loans identified as subprime based on the borrower’s FICO score at time the loan was originated do not represent a material part of our lending activity.  Accordingly, these loans are identified as “exclusions” as defined pursuant to regulatory guidance issued by the FDIC in Financial Institutions Letter FIL-9-2001 on subprime lending. At June 30, 2017, $1.2 million of one-to-four family loans were in nonaccrual status. One-to-four family loans of $21,000 were charged off during the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to $258,000 of one-to-four family loans that were charged-off during the year ended June 30, 2016.
Mortgage reform rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act became effective in January 2014, requiring lenders to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a borrower’s ability to repay any consumer closed-end credit transaction secured by a dwelling and to limit prepayment penalties. Increased risks of legal challenge, private right of action and regulatory enforcement are presented by these rules. Anchor Bank does not originate loans that do not meet the regulatory definition of a qualified mortgage.
Construction and Land Loans.  We have been an active originator of real estate construction loans in our market area since 1990. At June 30, 2017, our construction loans totaled $49.2 million or 12.8% of the total loan portfolio, an increase of $27.4 million or 125.7% since June 30, 2016. The majority of these loans are for the construction of multi-family and commercial properties.
We generally provide an interest reserve for funds on builder construction loans that have been advanced.  Interest reserves are a means by which a lender builds in, as a part of the loan approval and as a component of the cost of the project, the amount of the monthly interest required to service the debt during the construction period of the loan.  
At June 30, 2017, our construction loan portfolio contained four loans totaling $4.8 million which had been previously extended or renewed. Our entire construction loan portfolio at June 30, 2017 consisted of 53 loans requiring interest only payments, 34 of which totaled $37.8 million and were relying on the interest reserve to make this payment. At June 30, 2017, no construction loans were delinquent. No construction loans were charged-off during the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016.

(1) | Loans in process for these loans at June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $61.6 million, $37.9 million and $7.2 million, respectively.

For the year ended June 30, 2017, we originated 27 builder construction loans to fund the construction of one-to-four family properties totaling $26.6 million, as compared to 28 for $25.0 million during the year ended June 30, 2016, and two for $4.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2015. We originate construction and site development loans to experienced contractors and builders in our market area primarily to finance the construction of single-family homes and subdivisions, which homes typically have an average price ranging from $200,000 to $500,000.  All builders were qualified using the same standards as other commercial loan credits, requiring minimum debt service coverage ratios and established cash reserves to carry projects through construction completion and sale of the project. The maximum loan-to-value limit on both pre-sold and speculative projects is generally up to 75% of the appraised market value or sales price upon completion of the project. Development plans are required from builders prior to making the loan. We also require that builders maintain adequate insurance coverage. Maturity dates for residential construction loans are largely a function of the estimated construction period of the project, and generally did not exceed 18 months for residential subdivision development loans at the time of origination. Our residential construction loans typically have adjustable rates of interest based on The Wall Street Journal prime rate and during the term of construction, the accumulated interest is added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve. Construction loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and based on inspections by our approved inspectors.  At June 30, 2017, our largest builder relationship consisted of one loan for $6.6 million, including $3.0 million which was undisbursed.
We also make construction loans for commercial development projects. These projects include multi-family, apartment, retail, office/warehouse and office buildings. These loans generally have an interest-only phase during construction, rely on an interest reserve to fund interest payments and generally convert to permanent financing when construction is completed. Disbursement of funds is at our sole discretion and is based on the progress of the construction. The maximum loan-to-value limit applicable to these loans is generally 75% of the appraised post-construction value.  Additional analysis and underwriting of these loans typically results in lower loan-to-value ratios based on the debt service coverage analysis, including our interest rate and vacancy stress testing.  Our target minimum debt coverage ratio is 1.20 for loans on these projects.  At June 30, 2017, our portfolio of construction loans for commercial and multi-family projects included 17 loans totaling $32.4 million, and there was an additional $42.1 million undisbursed.  These loan commitments range in size from $659,000 to $8.8 million with an average disbursed balance of $1.9 million. These loans were for the construction of ten multi-family complexes, one office, one industrial facility and four land developments, all of which are located in Washington. Monitoring construction progress and managing advances during construction are risks not present when lending on complete commercial properties. In order to mitigate these risks the Bank requires the use of an approved third-party construction process monitoring firm for inspections, progress reports and construction budget oversight and utilizes construction loan management software to assist in assuring that advances are consistent with the progress that has been confirmed.
Properties which are the subject of a construction loan are monitored for progress through our construction loan administration department, and include monthly site inspections, inspection reports and photographs provided by a qualified staff inspector or a licensed and bonded third party inspection service contracted by and for us.  If we make a determination that there is deterioration, or if the loan becomes nonperforming, we halt any disbursement of those funds identified for use in paying interest and bill the borrower directly for interest payments.  Construction loans with interest reserves are underwritten similarly to construction loans without interest reserves.
9

We also originate land loans which are typically made to individual consumers to buy a lot or parcel of land for the future construction of the buyer’s primary residence and are included in “land loans”.  At June 30, 2017, our land loans totaled $8.1 million or 2.1% of the total loan portfolio, none of which were on nonaccrual status.
Our construction and land acquisition and development loans are based upon estimates of costs in relation to values associated with the completed project. Construction and land acquisition and development lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent residential lending because funds are advanced upon the collateral for the project based on an estimate of costs that will produce a future value at completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the completed project loan-to-value ratio. Changes in the demand, such as for new housing and higher than anticipated building costs may cause actual results to vary significantly from those estimated. If our appraisal of the value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. Because construction loans require active monitoring of the building process, including cost comparisons and on-site inspections, these loans are more difficult and costly to monitor. This type of lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. In addition, generally during the term of a construction loan, no payment from the borrower is generally required since the accumulated interest is added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve. 
Properties under construction are often difficult to sell and typically must be completed in order to be successfully sold which also complicates the process of working out problem construction loans. This may require us to advance additional funds and/or contract with another builder to complete construction and assume the market risk of selling the project at a future market price, which may or may not enable us to fully recover unpaid loan funds and associated construction and liquidation costs. Increases in market rates of interest may have a more pronounced effect on construction loans by rapidly increasing the end-purchasers' borrowing costs, thereby reducing the overall demand for the project. In addition, speculative construction loans to a builder are often associated with homes that are not pre-sold, and thus pose a greater potential risk to us than construction loans to individuals on their personal residences because there is the added risk associated with identifying an end-purchaser for the finished project.
Land loans also pose additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral.  These risks can be significantly impacted by the supply and demand conditions.  As a result, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor themselves to repay principal and interest.
Consumer Lending.  We offer a variety of consumer loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, automobile loans, credit cards and personal lines of credit. At June 30, 2017, the largest component of the consumer loan portfolio consisted of home equity loans and lines of credit, which totaled $14.0 million, or 3.6%, of the total loan portfolio.  Our home equity loans are risk priced using credit score, loan-to-value and overall credit quality of the applicant.  Home equity loans and lines of credit are made for a variety of purposes including improvement of residential properties. The majority of these loans are secured by a second deed of trust on owner-occupied primary single family residential property. Our home equity lines of credit include a maximum total term of 30 years, including an initial period of 10 years with interest-only payments and a variable rate of interest tied to the Prime Rate, plus a margin (the "draw" period), followed by 20 years of principal and interest payments under a level amortization schedule and an interest rate that is fixed for the 20 years at the fully indexed accrual rate as of the time of variable-to-fixed rate conversion. Our home equity loans are closed-end loans with a term of 20 years and have level amortization with regular monthly payments of principal and interest. The interest rate is risk based and reflects both credit and collateral risk. Both our home equity lines and home equity loans are available up to 95% of the combined loan to value ratio as determined by the Bank.
Our credit card portfolio includes both VISA and MasterCard brands, and totaled $2.6 million, or 0.7% of the total loan portfolio at June 30, 2017.  We have been offering credit cards for more than 20 years and all of our credit cards have interest rates and credit limits determined by the creditworthiness of the borrower.  We use credit bureau scores in addition to other criteria such as income in our underwriting decision process on these loans.
Our automobile loan portfolio totaled $627,000 or 0.2% of the total loan portfolio at June 30, 2017.  We offer several options for vehicle purchase or refinance with a maximum term of 84 months for newer vehicles and 72 months for older vehicles.  As with home equity loans, our vehicle and recreational vehicle loans are risk priced based on creditworthiness, loan term and loan-to-value.  We currently access a Carfax Vehicle Report to ensure that the collateral being loaned against is acceptable and to protect borrowers from a “lemon” or other undesirable histories. Other consumer loans, consisting primarily of unsecured personal lines of credit totaled $1.5 million or 0.4% of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2017.
10

Consumer loans entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles.  In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.  Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans.  These risks are not as prevalent with respect to our consumer loan portfolio because a large percentage of the portfolio consists of home equity lines of credit that are underwritten in a manner such that they result in credit risk that is substantially similar to one-to-four family mortgage loans.  Nevertheless, home equity lines of credit have greater credit risk than one-to-four family mortgage loans because they are secured by mortgages subordinated to the existing first mortgage on the property, which we may or may not hold and do not have private mortgage insurance coverage.  At June 30, 2017, $242,000 of consumer loans were on nonaccrual status.  Consumer loans of $193,000 were charged off during the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to $390,000 of consumer loans that were charged-off during the year ended June 30, 2016. 
Commercial Business Lending.  These loans are primarily originated as conventional loans to business borrowers, which include lines of credit, term loans and letters of credit.  These loans are typically secured by collateral and are used for general business purposes, including working capital financing, equipment financing, capital investment and general investments.  Loan terms vary from one to seven years.  The interest rates on such loans are generally floating rates indexed to The Wall Street Journal prime rate.  Inherent with our extension of business credit is the business deposit relationship which frequently includes multiple accounts and related services from which we realize low cost deposits plus service and ancillary fee income.
Commercial business loans typically have shorter maturity terms and higher interest spreads than real estate loans, but generally involve more credit risk because of the type and nature of the collateral. We are focusing our efforts on small- to medium-sized, privately-held companies with local or regional businesses that operate in our market area. Our commercial business lending policy includes credit file documentation and analysis of the borrower's background, capacity to repay the loan, the adequacy of the borrower's capital and collateral, as well as an evaluation of other conditions affecting the borrower. Analysis of the borrower's past, present and future cash flows is also an important aspect of our credit analysis. We generally obtain personal guarantees on our commercial business loans.  At June 30, 2017, commercial business loans totaled $31.6 million or 8.2% of our loan portfolio and was comprised of 170 loans in 73 different business classifications as identified by the North American Industrial Classification System.  The largest commercial business relationship at June 30, 2017 consisted of one loan for $9.0 million which is a purchased minority interest in a line of credit to provide warehouse lending to a financial services company which is collateralized by an assignment of finance notes receivable on residential housing secured by properties located in Washington, Oregon and Utah. Our total commitment under our minority interest in the line of credit is $10.3 million. The line of credit is repaid when the finance note is sold by the financial services company into the secondary market, with the proceeds from the sale used to pay down our pro rata portion of the outstanding line of credit.
Repayment of our commercial business loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our commercial business loans are originated primarily based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral consists of accounts receivable, inventory or equipment. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any. As a result, in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.  For the year ended June 30, 2017 there were no commercial business loan charge-offs as compared to $84,000 during the year ended June 30, 2016. At June 30, 2017, there were two commercial business loans totaling $300,000 on nonaccrual status. 
Loan Maturity and Repricing.  The following table sets forth certain information at June 30, 2017 regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in our portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity, but does not include scheduled payments or potential prepayments.  Demand loans, loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity, are reported as due in one year or less.  Loan balances do not include undisbursed loan proceeds, unearned discounts, unearned income and allowance for loan losses.

Loan Solicitation and Processing.  Loan originations are obtained from a variety of sources, including direct mail and telephone solicitation, trade and business organization participation.  Our management and staff are also involved in a wide variety of professional, charitable, service and social organizations within the communities in which we operate, and our branch managers, loan representatives and business bankers solicit referrals from existing clients and new prospects.  We also originate and cross sell loans and services to our existing customer base as well as our walk-in/call-in/internet traffic as a result of our long standing community presence and broad based advertising efforts.  Loan processing and underwriting, closing and funding are determined 
12

by the type of loan. Consumer loans, including conforming one-to-four family mortgage loans are processed, underwritten, documented and funded through our centralized processing and underwriting center located in Lacey, Washington.  Commercial business loans, including commercial and multi-family real estate loans and any non-conforming one-to-four family mortgage loans are processed and underwritten in one of our two Business Banking Center offices located in Lacey and Aberdeen, Washington. Our consumer and residential loan underwriters have specific approval authority, and requests that exceed such authority are referred to the appropriate supervisory level.
Depending upon the size of the loan request and the total borrower credit relationship with us, loan decisions may include the Executive Loan Committee, Senior Loan Committee, and/or Board of Directors.  The Executive Loan Committee is currently comprised of the President/Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Credit Administrator, Business Banking Manager, Note Department Manager, and Senior Data Manager. The Senior Loan Committee is a Board committee, comprised of three board members. Credit relationships up to $4.0 million may be approved by the Executive Loan Committee.  Loans or aggregated credit relationships which exceed $4.0 million must be approved by Senior Loan Committee, with an authority limit of $6.0 million, or by the Board of Directors.
Commercial and multi-family real estate loans can be approved up to $250,000 by the Chief Financial Officer, up to $500,000 by either the Senior Data Manager or Commercial Loan Administrator, and up to $750,000 by the Special Assets/Construction Manager.  These loans can be approved up to $1.0 million by either the President/Chief Executive Officer, Chief Lending Officer or Chief Credit Officer, and up to $2.0 million with the combination of both President/Chief Executive Officer, Chief Lending Officer or Chief Credit Officer.  Our Executive Loan Committee is authorized to approve loans to one borrower or a group of related borrowers up to $4.0 million.  Loans over $4.0 million must be approved by the Senior Loan Committee with a limit of $6.0 million, or the Board of Directors.
Loan Originations, Servicing, Purchases and Sales.  During the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, our combined total loan originations and purchases were $110.7 million and $141.4 million, respectively.
One-to-four family loans are generally originated in accordance with the guidelines established by Freddie Mac, with the exception of our special community development loans under the Community Reinvestment Act. We utilize the Freddie Mac Loan Prospector, an automated loan system to underwrite the majority of our residential first mortgage loans (excluding community development loans). The remaining loans are underwritten by designated real estate loan underwriters internally in accordance with standards as provided by our Board-approved loan policy.
We actively sell the majority of our residential fixed rate first mortgage loans to the secondary market at the time of origination. During the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, we sold $8.9 million and $7.7 million, respectively, in whole loans to the secondary market. Our secondary market relationship is with Freddie Mac. We generally retain the servicing on the loans we sell into the secondary market.  Loans are generally sold on a non-recourse basis. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, our residential loan servicing portfolio was $74.8 million and $76.9 million, respectively. 
In order to achieve our loan growth objectives and/or improve earnings, we may purchase loans, either individually, through participations, or in bulk. During the year ended June 30, 2016, we purchased $22.8 million in multi-family loans. The loan purchase consisted of 12 multi-family projects in King and Pierce counties. We have also participated with other lenders on commercial real estate loans located in Washington, whereby we receive a portion of a loan originated by another lender who retains the servicing and customer relationship of the loan and may, depending on the terms of the agreement, retain a portion of the interest as a servicing fee. During 2016 we participated in $9.9 million of commercial real estate loans and $15.8 million of commercial business loans, including the $9.0 million purchased minority interest in a line of credit to provide warehouse lending, discussed above. Purchased loans, loan pools, and participations are underwritten by our credit administration department, evaluated for credit risk, and approved by the appropriate loan committee(s) prior to purchase, according to our lending authority guidelines.

Loan Origination and Other Fees.  In some instances, we receive loan origination fees on real estate related products.  Loan fees generally represent a percentage of the principal amount of the loan that is paid by the borrower. Accounting standards require that certain fees received, net of certain origination costs, be deferred and amortized over the contractual life of the loan. Net deferred fees or costs associated with loans that are prepaid or sold are recognized as income at the time of prepayment. We had
14

$1.6 million of net deferred loan fees and costs as of June 30, 2017 compared to $1.5 million and $1.0 million at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Asset Quality
The objective of our loan review process is to determine risk levels and exposure to loss. The depth of review varies by asset types, depending on the nature of those assets. While certain assets may represent a substantial investment and warrant individual reviews, other assets may have less risk because the asset size is small, the risk is spread over a large number of obligors or the obligations are well collateralized and further analysis of individual assets would expand the review process without measurable advantage to risk assessment. Asset types with these characteristics may be reviewed as a total portfolio on the basis of risk indicators such as delinquency (consumer and residential real estate loans) or credit rating. A formal review process is conducted on individual assets that represent greater potential risk. A formal review process is a total re-evaluation of the risks associated with the asset and is documented by completing an asset review report. Certain real estate-related assets must be evaluated in terms of their fair market value or net realizable value in order to determine the likelihood of loss exposure and, consequently, the adequacy of valuation allowances.
We define a loan as being impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans such as consumer secured loans, residential mortgage loans and consumer unsecured loans are collectively evaluated for potential loss. All other loans are evaluated for impairment on an individual basis.
We generally assess late fees or penalty charges on delinquent loans of five percent of the monthly payment amount due. Substantially all fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loan payments are due on the first day of the month; however, the borrower is given a 15-day grace period to make the loan payment. When a mortgage loan borrower fails to make a required payment when it is due, we institute collection procedures. The first notice is mailed to the borrower on the 16th day requesting payment and assessing a late charge. Attempts to contact the borrower by telephone generally begin upon the 30th day of delinquency. If a satisfactory response is not obtained, continual follow-up contacts are attempted until the loan has been brought current. Before the 90th day of delinquency, attempts to interview the borrower are made to establish the cause of the delinquency, whether the cause is temporary, the attitude of the borrower toward the debt and a mutually satisfactory arrangement for curing the default.
When a consumer loan borrower fails to make a required payment on a consumer loan by the payment due date, we institute the same collection procedures as for our mortgage loan borrowers.
The Board of Directors is informed monthly as to the number and dollar amount of mortgage and consumer loans that are delinquent by more than 30 days, and is given information regarding classified assets.
If the borrower is chronically delinquent and all reasonable means of obtaining payments have been exercised, we will seek to recover the collateral securing the loan according to the terms of the security instrument and applicable law.  In the event of an unsecured loan, we will either seek legal action against the borrower or refer the loan to an outside collection agency.

Real Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets.  As of June 30, 2017, the Company had three real estate owned ("REO") properties with an aggregate book value of $867,000 compared to six properties with an aggregate book value of $373,000 at June 30, 2016.  At June 30, 2017, the largest of the REO properties was a residential real estate property with an aggregate book value of $647,000 located in Lewis County, Washington. 
Restructured Loans. According to generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to account for certain loan modifications or restructurings as “troubled debt restructurings.” Our policy is to track and report all loans modified to terms not generally available in the market, except for those outside of the materiality threshold established for such tracking and reporting. In general, the modification or restructuring of a debt is considered a troubled debt restructuring if we, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulties, grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider.  We will modify the loan when upon completion of the residence the home is rented instead of sold, or when the borrower can continue to make interest payments and is unable to repay the loan until the property is sold as a result of current market conditions. In connection with a loan modification, we may lower the interest rate, extend the maturity date and require monthly payments when monthly payments are not otherwise required. We may also require additional collateral. All loans which are extended with rates and/or terms below market are identified as impaired loans and an appropriate allowance is established pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  Loans which are placed in nonaccrual status and subsequently modified are not returned to accruing status until there has been at least six months of consecutive satisfactory performance.  As of June 30, 2017, there were 26 loans with aggregate net principal balances of $4.3 million that we have identified as “troubled debt restructures.”  In connection with these loans, a valuation allowance in the form of charged-off principal equal to $145,000 has been taken.  Of these 26 loans, one loan totaling $131,000 was not performing according to the modified repayment terms at June 30, 2017, and was classified as nonaccrual.
The existence of a guarantor is an important factor that we consider in every deteriorating credit relationship and in our determination as to whether or not to restructure the loan.  Additional factors we consider include the cooperation we receive from the borrower and/or guarantor as determined by the timeliness and quality of their direct and indirect communication, including providing us with current financial information; their willingness to develop new, and report on, previously identified risk mitigation strategies; and whether we receive additional collateral.  The financial ability of the borrower and/or guarantor is determined through a review and analysis of personal and business financial statements, tax return filings, liquidity verifications, personal and business credit reports, rent rolls, and direct reference checks.  The type of financial statements required of a borrower and/or guarantor varies based upon the credit risk and our aggregate credit exposure as it relates to the borrower and any guarantor. Reviewed financial statements are required for commercial business loans greater than $1.5 million and for commercial real estate loans greater than $5.0 million, with the level of outside independent accounting review decreasing as our risk exposure decreases.  We conduct reviews of the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors at least annually for credits of $750,000 or more, and for aggregate relationships of $1.5 million or more.
At both the time of loan origination and when considering a restructuring of a loan, we also assess the guarantor's character and reputation. This assessment is made by reviewing the duration of time such guarantor has been providing credit guarantees, the aggregate of the contingent liabilities of such guarantor as it relates to guarantees of additional debt provided to other lenders, and the results of direct reference checks.  Cooperative and communicative borrowers and/or guarantors may create opportunities for restructuring a loan, however, this cooperation does not affect the amount of the allowance for loan losses recorded or the timing of charging off the loan.
Classified Assets.  Federal regulations provide for the classification of lower quality loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities, as substandard, doubtful or loss.  An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and repayment capacity of the borrower or of any collateral pledged.  Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values.  Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.
When we classify problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, we may establish a specific allowance in an amount we deem prudent and approved by senior management or the Classified Asset Committee to address the risk specifically or we may allow the loss to be charged-off against the general loan allowance. General loan allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been specifically allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as a loss, it is required to charge off such assets in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible.  Assets that do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification as substandard or doubtful but possess identified weaknesses are considered either watch or special 
17

mention assets.  Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by our regulators, which can order the establishment of additional loss allowances.
In connection with the filing of periodic reports with the FDIC classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. On the basis of our review of our loans, as of June 30, 2017, we had classified loans of $3.7 million.  The total amount classified represented 5.6% of equity capital and 0.8% of assets at June 30, 2017.
The aggregate amounts of our classified loans at the date indicated (as determined by management), were as follows:

 | At June 30, 
 | 2017 | | 2016
 | (In thousands)
Classified Loans: | | | 
Substandard | $ | 3,721 | | | $ | 2,773
Doubtful | — | | | — | 
Loss | — | | | — | 
Total | $ | 3,721 | | | $ | 2,773

Our $3.7 million of substandard loans at June 30, 2017, consisted primarily of $3.0 million of real estate secured loans and $699,000 of consumer and commercial business loans. Of the $3.0 million of substandard loans which were real estate secured, $1.0 million were one-to-four family, $2.0 million were commercial real estate, $392,000 were home equity loans, and $7,000 was a mobile home loan, secured by property located in Washington.  
Potential Problem Loans.  Potential problem loans are loans that do not yet meet the criteria for identification as classified assets graded as substandard or doubtful, but where known information about the borrower causes management to have serious concerns about the ability of the borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms and may result in the loan being included as a classified asset for future periods.  At June 30, 2017, we had $7.0 million, or 1.8% of our net loans that were identified as potential problem loans compared to $13.3 million or 3.8% of our net loans at June 30, 2016.
The largest problem loan at June 30, 2017 was a term loan of $1.1 million secured by commercial real estate in Washington representing 15.3% of our potential problem loans.  The commercial real estate property securing this loan is located in Western Washington and the loan was in compliance with its repayment terms at June 30, 2017. No other potential problem loan had a balance in excess of $1.0 million at June 30, 2017.
Allowance for Loan Losses.  Management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the allowance for loan losses must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our Chief Credit Officer assesses the allowance for loan and lease losses on a monthly basis and reports to the Board of Directors no less than quarterly.  The assessment includes analysis of several different factors, including delinquency, charge-off rates and the changing risk profile of our loan portfolio, as well as local economic conditions such as unemployment rates, bankruptcies and vacancy rates of business and residential properties.
We believe that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period and requires management to make assumptions about probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The impact of a sudden large loss could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would negatively affect earnings.
Our methodology for analyzing the allowance for loan losses consists of two components: general and specific allowances.  The formula allowance is determined by applying an estimated loss percentage to various groups of loans.  The loss percentages are generally based on various historical measures such as the amount and type of classified loans, past due ratios and loss experience, which could affect the collectability of the respective loan types.
The specific allowance component is created when management believes that the collectability of a specific large loan, such as a real estate, multi-family or commercial real estate loan, has been impaired and a loss is probable.
18

The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, which is charged against current period earnings and decreased by the amount of actual loan charge-offs, net of recoveries.
We had a $310,000 provision for loan losses for the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to a $340,000 provision for loan losses at June 30, 2016, primarily reflecting loan growth.  The specific risks that are considered in our analysis for determining the provision for loan losses include an automatic elevation in risk grade and corresponding reserve requirement based on loan payment and payment delinquencies, including debt to the borrower and related entities under loans to one borrower guidelines; and a qualitative analysis of the economic and portfolio trends.  We also continually monitor the market conditions reported at national, regional, and local levels including those from the FDIC, Case-Shiller, and Realtor Boards.
The calculation of the allowance for loan losses includes an incremental component, a qualitative component, and specific reserve amount as a result of impairment analysis.  The total allowance for loan losses was $4.1 million and $3.8 million at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Of the total allowance at June 30, 2017, specific reserves decreased to $198,000 and general reserves increased to $3.9 million from specific reserves of $590,000 and general reserves of $3.2 million, respectively, at June 30, 2016. The level of the allowance is based on estimates, and the ultimate losses may vary from the estimates.  Management will continue to review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and make adjustments to the provision for loan losses based on loan growth, economic conditions, charge-offs and portfolio composition.
Levels and trends in delinquencies and nonperforming loans have increased during the year ended June 30, 2017. During the current economic cycle, we have experienced changes in our portfolio with respect to delinquent, nonperforming and impaired loans.  At June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, our total delinquent loans, including loans 30 or more days past due, were $4.1 million and $3.3 million, respectively, which included nonperforming loans of $3.7 million and $2.0 million at the end of each year.  The increase in total delinquent loans was primarily the result of a $2.0 million commercial real estate loan becoming delinquent although the loan was still accruing interest at June 30, 2017. Net (recoveries) charge-offs during the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 were $(17,000) and $282,000, respectively. 
Management identifies a loan as impaired when the source of repayment of the loan is recognized as being in jeopardy, such that economic or other changes have affected the borrower to the extent that it may not be able to meet repayment terms, and that resources available to the borrower, including the liquidation of collateral, may be insufficient.  Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for each loan based upon its source or sources of repayment. For collateral dependent loans management utilizes the valuation from an appraisal obtained generally within the last six months in establishing the allowance for loan losses, unless additional information known to management results in management applying a downward adjustment to the valuation. Appraisals are updated subsequent to the time of origination when management identifies a loan as impaired or potentially being impaired, as indicated by the borrower’s payment and loan covenant performance, an analysis of the borrower’s financial condition, property tax and/or assessment delinquency, increases in deferred maintenance or other information known to management.  When the results of the impairment analysis indicate a potential loss, the loan is classified as substandard and a specific reserve is established for such loan in the amount determined.  Further, the specific reserve amount is adjusted to reflect any further deterioration in the value of the collateral that may occur prior to liquidation or reinstatement.  The impairment analysis takes into consideration the primary, secondary, and tertiary sources of repayment, whether impairment is likely to be temporary in nature or liquidation is anticipated.
A loan is considered impaired when we have determined that we may be unable to collect payments of principal and/or interest when due under the terms of the loan. In the process of identifying loans as impaired, management takes into consideration factors which include payment history and status, collateral value, financial condition of the borrower, and the probability of collecting scheduled payments in the future. Minor payment delays and insignificant payment shortfalls typically do not result in a loan being classified as impaired. The significance of payment delays and shortfalls is considered by management on a case by case basis, after taking into consideration the totality of circumstances surrounding the loans and the borrowers, including payment history and amounts of any payment shortfall, length and reason for delay, and likelihood of return to stable performance.
Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for all loans in the portfolio except for the smaller groups of homogeneous consumer loans in the portfolio.
As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, we had impaired loans of $8.5 million and $10.7 million, respectively.  Included within the impaired loan totals are loans identified as troubled debt restructures.

Management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses.  However, unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustments to the allowance for loan losses and net income could be significantly affected, if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in determining the allowance.

Our Executive Loan Committee reviews the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and establishes the provision for loan losses based on the risk composition of our loan portfolio, delinquency levels, loss experience, economic conditions, bank regulatory examination results, seasoning of the loan portfolios and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio as detailed further in this Form 10-K under Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Loan Losses” of this Form 10-K. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, which is charged against current period operating results and decreased by the amount of actual loan charge-offs, net of recoveries.
Management believes that our allowance for loan losses as of June 30, 2017 was adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date. While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provision that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.
The following table provides certain summary information with respect to our allowance for loan losses, including charge-offs, recoveries and selected ratios for the periods indicated:

Investment Activities 
General.  Under Washington law, savings banks are permitted to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, banker’s acceptances, repurchase agreements, federal funds, commercial paper, investment grade corporate debt securities, and obligations of states and their political sub-divisions.
The Investment Committee has the authority and responsibility to administer our investment policy, monitor portfolio strategies, and recommend appropriate changes to policy and strategies to the Board.  On a monthly basis, our management reports to the Board a summary of investment holdings with respective market values, and all purchases and sales of investments.  The Chief Financial Officer has the primary responsibility for the management of the investment portfolio.  The Chief Financial Officer considers various factors when making decisions regarding proposed investments, including the marketability, maturity and tax consequences. The maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions, including the current and anticipated slope of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, the trend of new deposit inflows and the anticipated demand for funds via deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases. 
The general objectives of the investment portfolio are to provide liquidity when loan demand is high, to assist in maintaining earnings when loan demand is low and to maximize earnings while satisfactorily managing risk, including credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.

At June 30, 2017, our investment portfolio consisted principally of mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds and mutual funds consisting of mortgage-backed securities.  From time to time, investment levels may increase or decrease depending upon yields available on investment opportunities and management’s projected demand for funds for loan originations, deposits and other activities.
Mortgage-Backed Securities.  The mortgage-backed securities in our investment portfolio were comprised of Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities.  At June 30, 2017, the amortized cost of mortgage-backed securities held in the available-for-sale category was $21.4 million with a weighted average yield of 2.75%, while the mortgage-backed securities in the held-to-maturity category was $4.9 million with a weighted average yield of 3.19%.
Municipal Bonds.  The tax-exempt and taxable municipal bond portfolios were comprised of general obligation bonds (i.e., backed by the general credit of the issuer) and revenue bonds (i.e., backed by revenues from the specific project being financed) issued by various municipal corporations.   All bonds are rated “A” or better and are from issuers located within the State of Washington. The weighted average yield on the tax exempt bonds (on a tax equivalent basis) was 5.74% at June 30, 2017, and the total amount of amortized cost of our municipal bonds was $165,000 at that date, of which all were categorized as available-for-sale. 
Federal Home Loan Bank Stock.  As a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB of Des Moines.  The amount of stock we hold is based on guidelines specified by the FHLB of Des Moines. The redemption of any excess stock is determined daily based on our membership requirement as well as outstanding borrowings. The carrying value of FHLB stock was $2.3 million at June 30, 2017.
Our investment in FHLB stock is carried at cost, which approximates fair value.  As a member of the FHLB System, we are required to maintain a minimum level of investment in FHLB stock based on specific percentages of our outstanding mortgages, total assets, or FHLB advances.  At June 30, 2017, our minimum investment requirement was $2.0 million.  We were in compliance with the FHLB minimum investment requirement at June 30, 2017.  For the year ended June 30, 2017, we received $75,000 of dividends from the FHLB.
Bank-Owned Life Insurance.  We purchase bank-owned life insurance policies (“BOLI”) to offset future employee benefit costs.  At June 30, 2017, we had a $20.0 million investment in life insurance contracts.  The purchase of BOLI policies, and its increase in cash surrender value, is classified as “Life insurance investment, net of surrender charges” in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  The income related to the BOLI, which is generated by the increase in the cash surrender value of the policy. See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K for our Consolidated Financial Statements and specifically the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements of Income regarding BOLI.

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds
General.  Deposits and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes.  Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates and market conditions.  Borrowings from the FHLB of Des Moines are used to supplement the availability of funds from other sources and also as a source of term funds to assist in the management of interest rate risk.
Our deposit composition reflects a mixture with certificates of deposit accounting for approximately one-half of the total deposits and interest and noninterest-bearing checking, savings and money market accounts comprising the balance of total deposits.  We rely on marketing activities, convenience, customer service and the availability of a broad range of deposit products and services to attract and retain customer deposits.
Deposits.  Substantially all of our depositors are residents of Washington State.  Deposits are attracted from within our market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit with a variety of rates.  Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors.  In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the development of long term profitable customer relationships, current market interest rates, current maturity structure and deposit mix, our customer preferences and the profitability of acquiring customer deposits compared to alternative sources.
At June 30, 2017, we had $85.8 million of jumbo ($100,000 or more) retail certificates of deposit.  We also had $9.2 million in public funds, which represented 2.7% of total deposits at June 30, 2017.  Anchor Bank had no brokered deposits at June 30, 2017.  
In the unlikely event we are liquidated, depositors will be entitled to full payment of their deposit accounts prior to any payment being made to Anchor Bancorp, as the sole shareholder of Anchor Bank. For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Borrowings.  Customer deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities.  We do, however, use advances from the FHLB of Des Moines to supplement our supply of lendable funds, to meet short-term deposit withdrawal requirements and also to provide longer term funding to better match the duration of selected loan and investment maturities.
28

As one of our capital management strategies, we have used advances from the FHLB of Des Moines to fund loan originations in order to increase our net interest income.  Depending upon the retail banking activity and the availability of excess capital, we will consider and undertake additional leverage strategies within applicable regulatory requirements or restrictions.  Such borrowings would be expected to primarily consist of FHLB of Des Moines advances.
As a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB of Des Moines and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of that stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the U.S. Government) provided certain creditworthiness standards have been met.  Advances are individually made under various terms pursuant to several different credit programs, each with its own interest rate and range of maturities.  Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit.  We also maintain a committed credit facility with the FHLB of Des Moines that provides for immediately available advances up to an aggregate of 35% of the prior quarter’s total assets of Anchor Bank. At June 30, 2017, outstanding advances to Anchor Bank from the FHLB of Des Moines totaled $45.5 million as compared to $62.0 million at June 30, 2016.

Subsidiaries and Other Activities
Anchor Bank.  Anchor Bank has one wholly-owned subsidiary, Anchor Financial Services, Inc., that is currently inactive and is in the process of closing the subsidiary.   At June 30, 2017, Anchor Bank’s equity investment in Anchor Financial Services, Inc. was $303,000. 
Competition
Anchor Bank operates in an intensely competitive market for the attraction of deposits (generally its primary source of lendable funds) and in the origination of loans.  Historically, its most direct competition for deposits has come from large commercial banks, thrift institutions and credit unions in its primary market area.  In times of high interest rates, Anchor Bank experiences additional significant competition for investors' funds from short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities.  Anchor Bank's competition for loans comes principally from mortgage bankers, commercial banks and other thrift institutions.  Such competition for deposits and the origination of loans may limit Anchor Bank's future growth and earnings prospects. 
29

Natural Disasters
Grays Harbor, Thurston, Lewis, Pierce, Mason and King Counties, where substantially all of the real and personal properties securing our loans are located, is an earthquake-prone region.  We have not suffered any losses in the last sixteen years from earthquake damage to collateral secured loans, which include the July 1999 and February 2001 major earthquakes in the region.  Although we have experienced no losses related to earthquakes, a major earthquake could result in material loss to us in two primary ways.  If an earthquake damages real or personal properties collateralizing outstanding loans to the point of insurable loss, material loss would be suffered to the extent that the properties are uninsured or inadequately insured.  A substantial number of our borrowers do not have insurance which provides for coverage as a result of losses from earthquakes.  Earthquake insurance is generally not required by other lenders in the market area, and as a result in order to remain competitive in the marketplace, we do not require earthquake insurance as a condition of making a loan.  Earthquake insurance is also not always available at a reasonable coverage level and cost because of changing insurance underwriting practices in our market area resulting from past earthquake activity and the likelihood of future earthquake activity in the region.  In addition, if the collateralized properties are only damaged and not destroyed to the point of total insurable loss, borrowers may suffer sustained job interruptions or job loss, which may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their loan obligations.  While risk of credit loss can be insured against by, for example, job interruption insurance or “umbrella” insurance policies, such forms of insurance often are beyond the financial means of many individuals.  Accordingly, for most individuals, sustained job interruption or job loss would likely result in financial hardship that could lead to delinquency in their financial obligations or even bankruptcy.  Accordingly, no assurances can be given that a major earthquake in our primary market area will not result in material losses to us. 
Employees
At June 30, 2017, we had 103 full-time equivalent employees.  Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group.  We consider our employee relations to be good.

Pending Merger
On April 11, 2017, Washington Federal entered into the merger agreement with Anchor Bancorp. The merger agreement provides that, subject to its terms and conditions, Anchor Bancorp will merge with and into Washington Federal with Washington Federal as the surviving corporation in the merger. Immediately after the merger, Washington Federal intends to complete the bank merger.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, at the closing of the merger, each share of the common stock of Anchor Bancorp outstanding immediately prior to the closing will be converted into the right to receive a fraction of a share of Washington Federal common stock. The exact number of shares to be issued and the exchange ratio will be determined based on the price of the Washington Federal common stock.
The merger agreement contains customary representations and warranties from both Washington Federal and Anchor Bancorp, and each party has agreed to customary covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to (1) the conduct of its business during the interim period between the execution of the merger agreement and the closing, including, in the case of the Anchor Bancorp, specific forbearances with respect to its business activities, (2) Anchor Bancorp’s obligation to call a meeting of its shareholders to approve the merger agreement, and, subject to certain exceptions, that its board of directors recommend that the Anchor Bancorp’s shareholders vote to approve the merger agreement, and (3) Anchor Bancorp’s non-solicitation obligations regarding alternative acquisition proposals. The merger agreement provides certain termination rights for both Washington Federal and Anchor Bancorp and further provides that a termination fee of $2,236,500 will be payable by Anchor Bancorp upon termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances.
The completion of the merger is subject to customary conditions, including approval of the merger agreement by the Anchor Bancorp’s shareholders and the receipt of required regulatory approvals.

The foregoing description of the merger agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, attached as Exhibit 2.1 to Anchor Bancorp’s Current Report on Form 8-K which was filed with the SEC on April 13, 2017. See “Item 1.A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to the Pending Merger” for a description of the risks relating to the proposed transaction.
How We Are Regulated
The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations applicable to Anchor Bancorp and Anchor Bank. Descriptions of laws and regulations here and elsewhere in this report do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress or the Washington State Legislature that may affect the operations of Anchor Bancorp and Anchor Bank.  In addition, the regulations governing us may be amended from time to time by our regulators, the FDIC, DFI, Federal Reserve and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB").  Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future by the FDIC, DFI, Federal Reserve and CFPB could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.  We cannot predict whether any such changes may occur.
The Dodd-Frank Act which was enacted in July 2010 imposed new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions and their holding companies. Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve. The CFPB assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. Anchor Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a smaller financial institution, we are generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC and the DFI with respect to our compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations.
Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking by the federal banking agencies, which has not been completed and will not take effect for some time, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Company, the Bank and the financial services industry more generally.  
Regulation and Supervision of Anchor Bank
General. Anchor Bank, as a state-chartered savings bank, is subject to applicable provisions of Washington law and to regulations and examinations of the DFI. It also is subject to examination and regulation by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of Anchor Bank to the maximum permitted by law. During these state or federal regulatory examinations, the examiners may, among other things, require Anchor Bank to provide for higher general or specific loan loss reserves, which can impact our capital and earnings. This regulation of Anchor Bank is intended for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") of the FDIC and not for the purpose of protecting shareholders of Anchor Bank or Anchor Bancorp. Anchor Bank is required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital and is subject to some limitations on the payment of dividends to Anchor Bancorp. See "- Capital Requirements" and "- Dividends" below.
Federal and State Enforcement Authority and Actions. As part of its supervisory authority over Washington-chartered savings banks, the DFI may initiate enforcement proceedings to obtain a cease-and-desist order against an institution believed to have engaged in unsafe and unsound practices or to have violated a law, regulation, or other regulatory limit, including a written agreement. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against insured institutions for similar reasons and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. Both these agencies may utilize less formal supervisory tools to address their concerns about the condition, operations or compliance status of a savings bank.
Regulation by the Washington Department of Financial Institutions. State law and regulations govern Anchor Bank's ability to take deposits and pay interest, to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate, to make consumer loans, to invest in securities, to offer various banking services to its customers, and to establish branch offices. As a state savings bank, Anchor Bank must pay semi-annual assessments, examination costs and certain other charges to the DFI.
Washington law generally provides the same powers for Washington savings banks as federally and other-state chartered savings institutions and banks with branches in Washington, subject to the approval of the DFI. Washington law allows Washington savings banks to charge the maximum interest rates on loans and other extensions of credit to Washington residents which are allowable for a national bank in another state if higher than Washington limits. In addition, the DFI may approve applications by Washington savings banks to engage in an otherwise unauthorized activity, if the DFI determines that the activity is closely related to banking, and Anchor Bank is otherwise qualified under the statute. This additional authority, however, is subject to review and approval by the FDIC if the activity is not permissible for national banks.
32

Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. The DIF of the FDIC insures deposit accounts in Anchor Bank up to $250,000 per separately insured depositor. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. Our deposit insurance premiums for the year ended June 30, 2017, were $145,000. 
Under the FDIC's risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. Rates are based on each institution's risk category and certain specified risk adjustments. Stronger institutions pay lower rates while riskier institutions pay higher rates. Assessments are based on an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity with an assessment rate schedule ranging from 2.5 to 45 basis points. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank.  Management cannot predict what assessment rates may be in the future.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.  We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.
Prompt Corrective Action.  Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.  An institution’s category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures, which include risk-based capital measures, Tier 1 and common equity Tier 1 capital measures, a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework. Under these regulations, an institution is treated as well capitalized if it has a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10.0% or more (the total risk-based capital ratio); a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio) of 8.0% or more; a ratio of Tier 1 common equity capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.5% or more (the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio); a ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (the leverage ratio) of 5.0% or more; and the institution is not subject to a federal order, agreement or directive to meet a specific capital level. An institution is considered adequately capitalized, if it is not well capitalized but it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or more; a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% or more; and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or more.  An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits generally. Any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized.
Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized.  Failure by an institution to comply with applicable capital requirements would, if unremedied, result in progressively more severe restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator.  Banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements.  Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements.
At June 30, 2017, Anchor Bank was categorized as "well capitalized". For additional information, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8., "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
Capital Requirements. The minimum capital level requirements applicable to Anchor Bank are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 ("CETI") capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) unless an institution elects to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital; and certain minority interests; all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 1 capital generally consists of CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of other preferred stock and subordinated debt meeting certain conditions plus an amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. 
There is also a requirement for a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.5% above these regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital and results in the following minimum ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The capital conservation buffer requirement is implemented in phases beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing by that amount each year until it is fully implemented in January 2019. A financial institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount.

Excess | $ | 41,347 | | | 9.0 | % | | $ | 39,539 | | 9.5 | %

The FDIC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution’s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of particular risks or circumstances.
Anchor Bank’s management believes that, under the current regulations, Anchor Bank will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future.  For additional information regarding the Bank’s required and actual capital levels at June 30, 2017, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8., “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.
Federal Home Loan Bank System.  Anchor Bank is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines. As a member, Anchor Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB. At June 30, 2017, the Bank had $2.3 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. It makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures, established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. See "Business - Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds - Borrowings" in this Form 10-K. 
The FHLBs continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects.  These contributions have affected adversely the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future.  These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future.  A reduction in value of Anchor Bank's FHLB stock may result in a corresponding reduction in its capital.
Standards for Safety and Soundness.  The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to: internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; loan documentation; credit underwriting; interest rate risk exposure; asset growth; asset quality; earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired.  Each insured depository institution must implement a 
34

comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution’s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities. The information security program must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer, and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information. Each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk-based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems.  If the FDIC determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines, it may require an institution to submit to the FDIC an acceptable plan to achieve compliance.
Real Estate Lending Standards. FDIC regulations require Anchor Bank to adopt and maintain written policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for real estate loans.  These standards, which must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, must establish loan portfolio diversification standards, prudent underwriting standards (including loan-to-value ratio limits) that are clear and measurable, loan administration procedures, and documentation, approval and reporting requirements.  Anchor Bank is obligated to monitor conditions in its real estate markets to ensure that its standards continue to be appropriate for current market conditions.  Anchor Bank’s Board of Directors is required to review and approve Anchor Bank’s standards at least annually.  The FDIC has published guidelines for compliance with these regulations, including supervisory limitations on loan-to-value ratios for different categories of real estate loans.  Under the guidelines, the aggregate amount of all loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value ratios should not exceed 100% of total capital, and the total of all loans for commercial, agricultural, multifamily or other non-one-to-four-family properties should not exceed 30% of total capital.  Loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value ratio limitations must be identified in Anchor Bank’s records and reported at least quarterly to Anchor Bank’s Board of Directors.  Anchor Bank is in compliance with the record and reporting requirements.  As of June 30, 2017, Anchor Bank’s aggregate loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value ratios were 2.27% and Anchor Bank’s loans on commercial, agricultural, multifamily or other non-one-to-four-family properties in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value ratios were 1.16%.  Based on strong risk management practices, Anchor Bank has consistently operated above the aggregate 100% of capital guideline limit since these standards were imposed.
Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Financial Institutions.  Federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks.  An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (1) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (2) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank’s total assets, (3) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors’, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage or bankers’ blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, and (4) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution owned by another FDIC-insured institution if certain requirements are met.
Environmental Issues Associated With Real Estate Lending. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present “owners and operators” of sites containing hazardous waste.  However, the term “owner and operator” excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site.  Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this “secured creditor exemption” has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan.  To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including Anchor Bank, that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs, which costs often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property.
Federal Reserve System.  The Federal Reserve requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits.  These reserves may be in the form of cash or noninterest-bearing deposits with the regional Federal Reserve Bank.  Negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to the reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a savings bank.  As of June 30, 2017, Anchor Bank’s deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and vault cash exceeded its reserve requirements.
Affiliate Transactions.  Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in certain transactions with their affiliates, including their bank holding companies.  Transactions deemed to be a “covered transaction” under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and between a subsidiary bank and its parent company or the nonbank subsidiaries of the bank holding company are limited to 10% of the bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus and, with respect to the parent company and all such nonbank subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus.  Further, covered transactions that are loans and extensions of credit generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts.  Federal law also requires that covered transactions and certain other transactions listed in Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act between a bank and its affiliates be on terms as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates.
35

Community Reinvestment Act and Consumer Protection Laws.  Anchor Bank is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”), which requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency to assess a bank’s performance under the CRA in meeting the credit needs of the community served by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods.  The regulatory agency’s assessment of the bank’s record is made available to the public.  Further, a bank’s CRA performance must be considered in connection with a bank’s application to, among other things, establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an existing office or merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution.  Anchor Bank received a “satisfactory” rating during its most recent examination. 
In connection with its deposit-taking, lending and other activities, the Bank is subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect consumers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. The CFPB issues regulations and standards under these federal consumer protection laws, which include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Through its rulemaking authority, the CFPB has promulgated several proposed and final regulations under these laws that will affect our consumer businesses. Among these regulatory initiatives, are final regulations setting “ability to repay” and “qualified mortgage” standards for residential mortgage loans and establishing new mortgage loan servicing and loan originator compensation standards. The Bank is evaluating these recent CFPB regulations and proposals and devotes substantial compliance, legal and operational business resources to ensure compliance with these consumer protection standards. In addition, the FDIC has enacted customer privacy regulations that limit the ability of the Bank to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties. The regulations require disclosure of privacy policies and allow consumers to prevent certain personal information from being shared with non-affiliated parties. 
Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Laws. The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. These laws and regulations require the Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution's anti-money laundering activities when reviewing mergers and acquisitions. 
Dividends. The amount of dividends payable by Anchor Bank to Anchor Bancorp depends upon Anchor Bank’s earnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies.  According to Washington law, Anchor Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend on its capital stock if it would cause its net worth to be reduced below (1) the amount required for liquidation accounts or (2) the net worth requirements, if any, imposed by the Director of the DFI.  Dividends on Anchor Bank’s capital stock may not be paid in an aggregate amount greater than the aggregate retained earnings of Anchor Bank, without the approval of the Director of the DFI.
The amount of dividends actually paid during any one period is strongly affected by Anchor Bank’s policy of maintaining a strong capital position.  Federal law further provides that no insured depository institution may pay a cash dividend if it would cause the institution to be “undercapitalized,” as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations and the ability to pay dividends can also be limited by the capital conservation buffer requirement.  Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments are deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. 
Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations. The Bank is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While this list set forth below is not exhaustive, these include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties including, but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights.
Regulation and Supervision of Anchor Bancorp
General.  Anchor Bancorp is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve and the sole shareholder of Anchor Bank.  Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder.  This regulation and oversight is generally 
36

intended to ensure that Anchor Bancorp limits its activities to those allowed by law and that it operates in a safe and sound manner without endangering the financial health of Anchor Bank.
As a bank holding company, Anchor Bancorp is required to file quarterly reports with the Federal Reserve and any additional information required by the Federal Reserve and will be subject to regular examinations by the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries).  In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.
The Bank Holding Company Act.  Under the BHCA, Anchor Bancorp is supervised by the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner.  In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act and earlier Federal Reserve policy provides that bank holding companies should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks by being prepared to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity, and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks.  A bank holding company's failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve's regulations (or the Dodd-Frank Act) or both.
Under the BHCA, the Federal Reserve may approve the ownership of shares by a bank holding company in any company the activities of which the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.  These activities generally include, among others, operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit related insurance; leasing property on a full payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers’ checks and U.S. Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers. 
Acquisitions.  The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries.  A bank holding company that meets certain supervisory and financial standards and elects to be designed as a financial holding company may also engage in certain securities, insurance and merchant banking activities and other activities determined to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activities. The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries.
Interstate Banking.  The Federal Reserve must approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located in a state other than the holding company's home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state.  The Federal Reserve may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period, not exceeding five years, specified by the law of the host state.  Nor may the Federal Reserve approve an application if the applicant controls or would control more than 10% of the insured deposits in the United States or 30% or more of the deposits in the target bank's home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch.  Federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state that may be held or controlled by a bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies.  Individual states may also waive the 30% state-wide concentration limit contained in the federal law.
The federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the law of any state, unless the home state of one of the banks adopted a law prior to June 1, 1997 which applies equally to all out-of-state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out-of-state banks.  Interstate acquisitions of branches are permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions.  Interstate mergers and branch acquisitions are also subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration amounts described above.
Regulatory Capital Requirements.  The Federal Reserve has adopted capital rules pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications under the BHCA. These rules apply on a consolidated basis to bank holding companies with $500 million or more in assets, or with fewer assets but certain risky activities, and on a bank-only basis to other companies. The bank holding company capital adequacy and capital conservation rules are the same as those imposed by the FDIC on the Bank. For a bank holding company with less than $500 million in total consolidated assets, such as the Company, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis and the Federal Reserve expects the 
37

holding company's subsidiary banks to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC approved revisions to their capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. As of June 30, 2017, Anchor Bancorp exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with Tier 1 leverage-based capital, CET1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios of 14.0%, 15.2%, 15.2% and 16.2%, respectively. For additional information, see the section above entitled “- Regulation and Supervision of Anchor Bank - Capital Requirements” and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8., "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K.
Restrictions on Dividends.  Anchor Bancorp’s ability to declare and pay dividends may depend in part on dividends received from Anchor Bank.  The Revised Code of Washington regulates the distribution of dividends by savings banks and states, in part, that dividends may be declared and paid out of accumulated net earnings, provided that the bank continues to meet its surplus requirements.  In addition, dividends may not be declared or paid if Anchor Bank is in default in payment of any assessment due the FDIC.
Federal Reserve policy limits the payment of a cash dividend by a bank holding company if the holding company's net income for the past year is not sufficient to cover both the cash dividend and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. A bank holding company that does not meet any applicable capital standard would not be able to pay any cash dividends under this policy. A bank holding company not subject to consolidated capital requirements is expected not to pay dividends unless its debt-to-equity ratio is less than 1:1, and it meets certain additional criteria. The Federal Reserve also has indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. The capital conservation buffer requirements may limit the Company's ability to pay dividends in the future.
Except for a company that meets the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies, is well managed, and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, a bank holding company is required to give  the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company's consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation or regulatory order, condition, or written agreement. A bank holding company is considered well-capitalized if on a consolidated basis it has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0% and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or more, and is not subject to an agreement, order, or directive to maintain a specific level for any capital measure. Under Washington corporate law, Anchor Bancorp generally may not pay dividends if after that payment it would not be able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business, or its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities.
Stock Repurchases.  Bank holding companies, except for certain “well-capitalized” and highly rated bank holding companies, are required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of their consolidated net worth.  The Federal Reserve may disapprove a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The Dodd-Frank-Act imposes restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions, and required new capital regulations that are discussed above under “- Regulation and Supervision of Anchor Bank - New Capital Regulations.” In addition, among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies, such as Anchor Bancorp, to (i) provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote (a) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers and (b) at least once every six years on whether they should have a “say on pay” vote every one, two or three years; (ii) have a separate, non-binding shareholder vote regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; (iii) provide disclosure in annual proxy materials concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer; and (iv) amend Item 402 of Regulation S-K to require companies to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. For certain of these changes, the implementing regulations have not been promulgated, so the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on public companies cannot be determined at this time.
Federal Securities Law.  The stock of Anchor Bancorp is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a result, Anchor Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
38

Anchor Bancorp stock held by persons who are affiliates of Anchor Bancorp may not be resold without registration unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. Affiliates are generally considered to be officers, directors and principal shareholders. If Anchor Bancorp meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of Anchor Bancorp will be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period.
The SEC has adopted regulations and policies under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley ”), that apply to Anchor Bancorp as a registered company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The stated goals of these Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements are to increase corporate responsibility, provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The SEC and Sarbanes-Oxley related regulations and policies include very specific additional disclosure requirements and new corporate governance rules. Sarbanes-Oxley represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees. 
39

TAXATION
Federal Taxation
General. Anchor Bancorp and Anchor Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Anchor Bancorp or Anchor Bank. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to
U.S. federal or state/local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2014.
Anchor Bancorp files a consolidated federal income tax return with Anchor Bank. Any cash distributions made by Anchor Bancorp to its shareholders would be considered to be taxable dividends and not as a non-taxable return of capital to shareholders for federal and state tax purposes.
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Anchor Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a fiscal year ending on June 30 for filing its federal income tax return.
Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, called alternative minimum taxable income.  The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years.
Net Operating Loss Carryovers. A financial institution may carryback net operating Federal losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. This provision applies to losses incurred in taxable years beginning after August 6, 1997.
Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. Anchor Bancorp may eliminate from its income dividends received from Anchor Bank as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anchor Bancorp if it elects to file a consolidated return with Anchor Bank.  The corporate dividends-received deduction is 100% or 80%, in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return, depending on the level of stock ownership of the payor of the dividend.  Corporations which own less than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct 70% of dividends received or accrued on their behalf.
Washington Taxation
Anchor Bank is subject to a business and occupation tax imposed under Washington law at the rate of 1.5% of gross receipts.  Interest received on loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on residential properties and certain securities are exempt from this tax. 
Oregon Taxation 
The Company files income tax returns in Oregon State and within local jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state/local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2014.
