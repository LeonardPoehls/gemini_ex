ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
In this report, unless the context requires otherwise, references to the "Company", "Petrone Worldwide", "we", "us" and "our" are to Petrone Worldwide, Inc.
 Overview
 We are an exclusive importer/exporter and distributor of commercial grade tableware products, decorative hotel guest room amenities, lavatory and bathroom fixtures and furniture, food and beverage service items, and trendy accessories for the Asian and the European marketplaces. Our exclusive brands include Front of the House and Room 360.
 Our founder, Victor Petrone, has spent over 20 years building a significant global network of buyers, comprised of distributors, hotels, resorts, cruise lines, and restaurants, for premium, chic, environmentally-conscious products and services. We have sales and marketing and product development expertise primarily in the hospitality business in Europe and Asia. We currently sell and market our product line we act as an exclusive distributor primarily to companies in the hospitality trade. Our product lines consist of vendor approved items for key accounts, which include large hotel groups, such as Marriott Hotel Brands, The Four Seasons Hotel & Resorts, Hilton Worldwide, Hyatt Hotels & Resorts, Starwood Hotel & Resorts, and Fairmont Hotel & Resorts, and smaller hotel chains and upscale restaurants.
 We have been managing our cash needs through sales of our common stock for fulfillment (manufacturing, packaging and shipment), and hope that the cashflow through our sales will eliminate our need to sell stock and that future orders will be self-funding. Once our business becomes cashflow positive, we intend to raise additional funds through common stock offerings to provide working capital to finance several acquisitions. We also intend to continue to strengthen our balance sheet by paying off debt either through issuance of equity in exchange for cancellation of debt obligations or the payment of debt obligations with cash. For a summary of our unregistered sales of securities, please see “Recent Financings” below.
 Organization
 
On January 29, 2014 and effective March 3, 2014, we entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Petrone Food Works, Inc. (“PFW”) and the shareholder of PFW. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we acquired 100% of PFW’s issued and outstanding common stock from the PFW shareholder in exchange for the issuance of 11,760,542 shares of our common stock, representing 98.4% of the outstanding common stock, (the “Exchange”), after giving effect to a 1-for-500 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) which resulted in 195,607 common shares outstanding prior to the Exchange for liabilities of $30,000. Accordingly, the PFW shareholder became a shareholder of the Company and PFW became a subsidiary of the Company. The Exchange has been accounted for as a reverse-merger and recapitalization since the stockholder of PFW obtained voting and management control of our Company. PFW is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and we are the acquired company. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the operations reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the Exchange are those of PFW and were recorded at the historical cost basis of PFW, and the consolidated financial statements after completion of the Exchange included the assets and liabilities of both the Company and PFW and our consolidated operations from the closing date of the Exchange. All share and per share data in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split and recapitalization. PFW was formed under the laws of the State of Nevada in October 2013.
 
On December 1, 2016, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to increase its authorized shares from 110,000,000 shares to 910,000,000 shares. The capital stock of the Corporation is divided into two classes: (1) Common Stock in the amount of 900,000,000 shares, having par value of $0.001 each, and (2) Preferred Stock in the amount of 10,000,000 shares, having par value of $0.001 each.

Equity Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement
 
On October 24, 2016 (the “Closing Date”), we entered into an equity purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Peak One Opportunity Fund, L.P. (“Peak One”), whereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Peak One is committed to purchase shares of our common stock (the “Purchase Shares”) at an aggregate price of up to $5,000,000 (the “Total Commitment Amount”) over the course of its 24-month term.
 
From time to time over the 24-month term of the Purchase Agreement, commencing on the date on which a registration statement registering the Purchase Shares (the “Registration Statement”) becomes effective, we may, in our sole discretion, provide Peak One with a put notice (each a “Put Notice”) to purchase a specified number of the Purchase Shares (each a “Put Amount Requested”) subject to the limitations discussed below and contained in the Purchase Agreement. Upon delivery of a Put Notice, we must deliver the Put Amount Requested as Deposit Withdrawal at Custodian (“DWAC”) shares to Peak One within two (2) trading days.
 
The actual amount of proceeds we receive pursuant to each Put Notice (each, the “Put Amount”) is to be determined by multiplying the Put Amount Requested by the applicable purchase price. The purchase price for each of the Purchase Shares equals 90% of the “Market Price,” which is defined as the lesser of the (i) lowest closing bid price of our common stock for any trading day during the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the date of the respective Put Notice, or (ii) lowest closing bid price of the common stock for any trading day during the seven (7) trading days immediately following the clearing date associated with the applicable Put Notice (the “Valuation Period”). Within three (3) trading days following the end of the Valuation Period, Peak One will deliver the Put Amount to us via wire transfer.
 
The Put Amount Requested pursuant to any single Put Notice must have an aggregate value of at least $15,000, and cannot exceed the lesser of (i) 200% of the average daily trading value of the common stock in the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the Put Notice or (ii) such number of shares of common stock that has an aggregate value of $100,000.
 
In order to deliver a Put Notice, certain conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement must be met, as provided therein. In addition, we are prohibited from delivering a Put Notice if: (i) the sale of Purchase Shares pursuant to such Put Notice would cause us to issue and sell to Peak One, or Peak One to acquire or purchase,  a number of shares of our common stock that, when aggregated with all shares of common stock purchased by Buyer pursuant to all prior Put Notices issued under the Purchase Agreement, would exceed the Total Commitment Amount; or (ii) the sale of the Commitment Shares pursuant to the Put Notice would cause us to issue and sell to Buyer, or Buyer to acquire or purchase, an aggregate number of shares of common stock that would result in Buyer beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock.
 
Unless earlier terminated, the Purchase Agreement will terminate automatically on the earlier to occur of: (i) 24 months after the initial effectiveness of the Registration Statement, (ii) the date on which Peak One has purchased or acquired all of the Purchase Shares, or (iii) the date on which certain bankruptcy proceedings are initiated with respect to the Company. In connection with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to issue 650,000 shares of our common stock (the “Commitment Shares”) to Peak One or Peak One’s designee as a commitment fee.
 
On the Closing Date, and in connection with the Purchase Agreement, we also entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with Peak One whereby we are obligated to file the Registration Statement to register the resale of the Commitment Shares and Purchase Shares. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we must (i) file the Registration Statement within thirty (30) calendar days from the Closing Date, (ii) use reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as promptly as possible after the filing thereof, but in any event no later than the 90th calendar day following the Closing Date, and (iii) use its reasonable efforts to keep such Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act until all of the Commitment Shares and Purchase Shares have been sold thereunder or pursuant to Rule 144.

On February 6, 2017, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 to register the resale of the underlying shares that Peak One may purchase. Peak One agreed to waive any claim that the Company was in breach of the Purchase Agreement due to filing the registration statement more than 30-days following the consummation of the transaction.
 
The foregoing descriptions of the Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to such Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement, which are filed hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to our current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 28, 2016, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
We claim an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, for the private placement of these securities pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder because, among other things, the transaction did not involve a public offering, Buyer is an accredited investor, Buyer acquired the securities for investment and not resale, and we took appropriate measures to restrict the transfer of the securities.
 
Securities Purchase Agreement and Debenture
 
On October 24, 2016 (the “Issuance Date”), we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “SPA”) with Buyer, whereby Buyer agreed to invest up to $346,500 (the “Purchase Price”) in our Company in exchange for the convertible debentures, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof. Pursuant to the SPA, we issued a convertible debenture to Buyer on October 26, 2016, in the original principal amount of $85,000, which bears interest at 0% per annum (the “First Debenture”). The Buyer paid the portion of the Purchase Price associated with the First Debenture, consisting of $76,500 (minus the applicable fees under the SPA), to us in cash on October 26, 2016. Each convertible debenture issued pursuant to the SPA, coupled with the accrued and unpaid interest relating to each convertible debenture, is due and payable three years from the issuance date of the respective convertible debenture. Any amount of principal or interest that is due under each convertible debenture, which is not paid by the respective maturity date, will bear interest at the rate of 18% per annum until it is satisfied in full. Additionally, the Buyer has the right at any time to convert amounts owed under each convertible debenture into shares of our common stock at the closing price of the Common Stock on September 8, 2015. Each debenture shall contain representations, warranties, events of default, beneficial ownership limitations, and other provisions that are customary of similar instruments.
The Buyer is entitled to, at any time or from time to time, convert each convertible debenture issued under the SPA into shares of our common stock, at a conversion price per share (the “Conversion Price”) equal to either: (i) if no event of default has occurred under the respective convertible debenture and the date of conversion is prior to the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the issuance date of the respective convertible debenture, $0.25, or (ii) if an event of default has occurred under the respective convertible debenture or the date of conversion is on or after the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the issuance date of the respective convertible debenture, the lesser of (a) $0.25 or (b) sixty five percent (65%) of the lowest closing bid price of the common stock for the twenty (20) trading days immediately preceding the date of the date of conversion (provided, further, that if either the Company is not DWAC operational at the time of conversion or the common stock is traded on the OTC Pink at the time of conversion, then sixty five percent (65%) shall automatically adjust to sixty percent (60%)), subject in each case to equitable adjustments resulting from any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or similar events.
 
We may redeem each convertible debenture issued under the SPA, upon not more than two (2) days written notice, for an amount (the “Redemption Price”) equal to: (i) if the Redemption Date (as defined below) is ninety (90) days or less from the date of issuance of the respective convertible debenture, One Hundred Five percent (105%) of the sum of the Principal Amount so redeemed plus accrued interest, if any; (ii) if the Redemption Date is greater than or equal to ninety one (91) days from the date of issuance of the respective convertible debenture and less than or equal to one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of issuance of the respective convertible debenture, One Hundred Ten percent (110%) of the sum of the Principal Amount so redeemed plus accrued interest, if any; (iii) if the Redemption Date is greater than or equal to one hundred twenty one (121) days from the date of issuance of the respective convertible debenture and less than or equal to one hundred fifty (150) days from the date of issuance of the respective convertible debenture, One Hundred Twenty percent (120%) of the sum of the Principal Amount so redeemed plus accrued interest, if any; (iv) if the Redemption Date is greater than or equal to one hundred fifty one (151) days from the date of issuance of the respective convertible debenture and less than or equal to one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of issuance of the respective convertible debenture, One Hundred Thirty percent (130%) of the sum of the Principal Amount so redeemed plus accrued interest, if any; and (v) if either (1) the respective convertible debenture is in default but the Buyer consents to the redemption notwithstanding such default or (2) the Redemption Date is greater than or equal to one hundred eighty one (181) days from the date of issuance of the respective convertible debenture, One Hundred Forty percent (140%) of the sum of the Principal Amount so redeemed plus accrued interest, if any. The date upon which the respective convertible debenture is redeemed and paid shall be referred to as the “Redemption Date” (and, in the case of multiple redemptions of less than the entire outstanding Principal Amount, each such date shall be a Redemption Date with respect to the corresponding redemption).

Securities Purchase Agreement and Note
 
On November 18, 2016 (the “Closing Date”), we consummated a transaction with an accredited investor (“Buyer”), whereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of that certain securities purchase agreement (the “SPA”), Buyer agreed to invest up to $340,000 (the “Purchase Price”) in our Company in exchange for a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $400,000 (the “Note”). The Note carries a prorated original issue discount of $60,000 and bears interest at the rate of 6% per year. On the Closing Date, the Buyer funded the first tranche under the Note, consisting of $34,000 in cash. Each tranche funded under the Note (each a “Tranche”), coupled with the accrued and unpaid interest relating to that respective Tranche, is due and payable twelve months from the funding date of the respective Tranche. Any amount of principal or interest that is due under each Tranche, which is not paid by the respective maturity date, will bear interest at the rate of 22% per annum until it is satisfied in full. The Buyer is entitled to, at any time or from time to time, convert each Tranche under the Note into shares of our common stock, at a conversion price per share equal to fifty five percent (55%) of the lowest traded price of the common stock for the twenty (20) trading days immediately preceding the date of the date of conversion, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Note. In connection with the issuance of the Note and SPA, we agreed to issue 450,000 shares of our common stock to Buyer. The Note contains representations, warranties, events of default, beneficial ownership limitations, prepayment options, and other provisions that are customary of similar instruments.

On February 13, 2017, we consummated a transaction with Labrys Fund, L.P. (“Buyer”), whereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of that certain securities purchase agreement (the “First SPA”), we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $110,000 (the “First Note”) to Buyer. The Company received proceeds of $100,000 in cash from the Buyer. The First Note bears interest at the rate of 12% per year. The First Note is due and payable six months from the issue date of the First Note. We may prepay the First Note at any time during the initial 180 days after the issue date of the First Note, without any prepayment penalty, by paying the face amount of the First Note plus accrued interest through such prepayment date. Any amount of principal or interest that is due under the First Note, which is not paid by the maturity date, will bear interest at the rate of 24% per annum until the First Note is satisfied in full.

We claim an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, for the private placement of these securities pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder because, among other things, the transaction did not involve a public offering, Buyer is an accredited investor, Buyer acquired the securities for investment and not resale, and we took appropriate measures to restrict the transfer of the securities.

Strategy, Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 
We continuously seek to extend our network of customers for the sale and distribution of the products. Our business strategy is to contract exclusively with successful manufacturers and develop their brand recognition and global sales through our established channels. As an exclusive importer/exporter and distributor, we believe we will generate increased gross profit margins resulting from fewer trade tariffs and logistics costs by bypassing the United States and delivering directly to buyers in foreign countries. This effectively eliminates U.S. trade duties and warehousing costs.

We believe that the overseas hospitality supply industry is highly diverse but fragmented in terms of manufacturers and distributors. In the markets we serve, there is an extensive assortment of products offered. However, suppliers and distributors are often out-of-stock and cannot fulfill orders on a timely basis. We believe that the he most attractive and immediate opportunities exist in the addressable segments of porcelain/tableware, lavatory fixtures, and utensils and other small equipment. These segments represent a multi-million dollar business in terms of annual revenues. For the companies that we represent and intend to represent, competition arises from large multi-national manufacturers and smaller manufacturers in specific countries or regions and in specific product niches. We cater to the mid to high star hospitality services industry and we believe our value proposition is superior to other competitors when considering depth of product offerings, quality and reliability, on-demand inventory, pricing and customer service support.
 We serve as an exclusive importer/exporter and distributor and we seek to appoint sub-distributors (the “Sub-distributors”) in each country where we have distribution agreements with our suppliers. Under our policy and procedure guidelines, our Sub-distributors will act as agents for brands that we represent as they place lines into their established networks and we can provide the Sub-distributors with the right product mix at the right price and the right time, rather than relying on their inferior previous offerings.
 
To date, dealer/distributors have frequently conducted business by selling common, locally-manufactured products that cannot compete with our product offerings. These sub-distributors have existing warehouses and personnel (sales and marketing, operational, customer service and administrative) that conduct regional with procurement agents at hotels and restaurants. Traditionally, international hotel chains and restaurants have primarily purchased premium products from the United States, which is costly due to higher product costs and freight charges. Through us, hotel chains will be able to purchase at the local level, at lower prices and with a shorter delivery cycle. By outsourcing important functions to our sub-distributors, we expect to contain fixed overhead and to reduce costs and management time.
 
We also have seasoned in-house marketing skill sets that enable us to attract new customers at low costs. These skill sets include developing and launching new product brands. We will promote the brand or product with a communication strategy that is tailored strictly towards the customer's goals.
 
Additionally, on October 21, 2015, we entered into a memorandum of undertaking with Dewan & Sons (the “Memorandum of Undertaking”). In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Memorandum of Undertaking, we agreed to: (i) undertake warehousing and logistics on behalf of Dewan & Sons in the United States, which include customer service, warehousing, and logistics inclusive of drop shipments and corporate office branch presence; and (ii) stock and sell Dewan & Sons’ products to Mexico and South and Central America markets. On February 4, 2016 and effective March 15, 2016, in connection with formalizing the Memorandum of Undertaking, we entered into a Warehousing and Logistics Agreement (the “Warehousing Agreement”) with Dewan & Sons to undertake JIT (Just In Time) distribution to all Dewan & Sons customers in North America, which includes direct store delivery of Dewan & Sons’ products to retail store, thereby bypassing a retailer’s distribution center to increase inventory and reduce margins. Management believes that in light of increasing port delays, planning for safety stock has become a critical component to reducing fulfillment costs. We expect that our supply chain operational efficiency will bring optimum results with minimum budget expense for Dewan & Sons. We also believe that the further alliance with Dewan & Sons will allow for increased real-time communication with purchasing agents and reduction of minimum order quantities so that smaller, more frequent orders can be placed off-setting long term risks of holding too much inventory. Pursuant to the terms of the Warehousing Agreement, Dewan & Sons agreed to pay us a flat fee for devanning, palletizing, shrink wrapping, labeling and storage.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, two customers accounted for approximately 43.0% of total sales (28.0% and 15.0%, respectively). For the year ended December 31, 2015, five customers accounted for approximately 85.3% of total sales (21.9%, 13.7%, 22.1%, 13.3% and 14.3%, respectively).  A reduction in sales from or loss of such customers would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
Competition 
 
Our business is highly competitive, with the principal competitive factors being customer service, price, product quality, new product development, brand name, delivery time and breadth of product offerings. Advantages or disadvantages in any of these competitive factors may be sufficient to cause the customer to consider changing providers of the kinds of products that we sell. Our competitors include large and small domestic and international manufacturers and distributors.

Dewan & Sons is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling stainless steel, copper, brass and aluminum small ware, buffet ware and tabletop goods under several distinctive trademarks, copyrights and other related intellectual property rights (the "Goods").
