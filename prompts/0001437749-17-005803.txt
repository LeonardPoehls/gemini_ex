BUSINESS OF WOLVERINE BANCORP, INC.
 
Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Maryland in 2010 as part of the mutual-to-stock conversion of Wolverine Bank, for the purpose of becoming the savings and loan holding company of Wolverine Bank. Since being incorporated, other than holding the common stock of Wolverine Bank, retaining approximately 50% of the net cash proceeds of the stock conversion offering and making a loan to the employee stock ownership plan of Wolverine Bank, we have not engaged in any business activities to date, except the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock as previously publicly disclosed. Through December 31, 2016, we have repurchased 481,622 shares of our common stock.
 
The Company is authorized to pursue business activities permitted by applicable laws and regulations, which may include the acquisition of banking and financial services companies. See “Supervision and Regulation – Holding Company Regulation” for a discussion of the activities that are permitted for savings and loan holding companies. We currently have no understandings or agreements to acquire other financial institutions, although we may determine to do so in the future. We may also borrow funds for reinvestment in Wolverine Bank.
 
Our cash flow depends on earnings from the investment of the net proceeds we retained from our initial public stock offering that was consummated in January 2011, and any dividends we receive from Wolverine Bank. We neither own nor lease any property, but pay a fee to Wolverine Bank for the use of its premises, equipment and furniture. At the present time, we employ only persons who are officers of Wolverine Bank who also serve as officers of Wolverine Bancorp, Inc.

     BUSINESS OF WOLVERINE BANK
 General
 
Wolverine Bank (the “Bank”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”), is a federally chartered savings bank headquartered in Midland, Michigan, the heart of the Great Lakes Bay Region with a population of over 500,000. Wolverine Bank was originally chartered in 1933. At December 31, 2016, we had $434.4 million of total assets, $280.5 million of deposits and $61.0 million of total stockholders’ equity. We provide financial services primarily to individuals, families and businesses in the Great Lakes Bay Region of Michigan and throughout all of Michigan through our two banking offices located in Midland, Michigan, which is the County Seat of Midland County, and our banking office in Frankenmuth, which is located in neighboring Saginaw County. Midland, Michigan is located approximately 120 miles northwest of Detroit and approximately 90 miles north of Lansing, Michigan, in the eastern portion of Michigan’s lower peninsula.

Our business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in commercial real estate loans including multi-family loans and land loans, one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, construction loans, and home equity loans and lines of credit and to a lesser extent, commercial non-mortgage loans and consumer loans (consisting primarily of mobile home loans, automobile loans, loans secured by savings deposits and other consumer loans). At December 31, 2016, $262.3 million, or 78.0%, of our total loan portfolio was comprised of commercial mortgage loans including multi-family mortgage loans and land loans, and $35.4 million, or 10.5%, of our total loan portfolio was comprised of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. We also may invest in securities, including U.S. government and agency debt securities, and to a lesser extent, municipal obligations.
 
We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including statement savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, commercial and consumer checking accounts and retirement accounts, including health savings accounts.
 
We offer extended hours at our branch offices, and we are dedicated to offering alternative banking delivery systems utilizing state-of-the-art technology, including ATMs, online banking, remote deposit capture, telephone banking, and mobile banking delivery systems. 
 
Generally, we retain in our portfolio all adjustable-rate loans that we originate, as well as fixed-rate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans with terms of less than 15 years. Consistent with our interest rate risk strategy and based upon the market and rate environment, we will consider holding in our portfolio longer term fixed-rate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Historically, as part of our interest rate risk strategy, we have sold substantially all of our fixed-rate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans with terms of 15 years or greater on a servicing-released basis. In 2016 we originated $17.3 million of loans for sale and sold $18.1 million of fixed-rate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, including refinances, in order to generate fee income and consistent with our interest rate risk strategy.
 
Wolverine Bank’s executive offices are located at 5710 Eastman Avenue, Midland, Michigan 48640. Our telephone number at this address is (989) 631-4280. Our website address is www.wolverinebank.com. Information on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this Annual Report.
 
Market Area
 
Wolverine Bank operates from two banking offices located in Midland, Michigan, and a banking office in Frankenmuth, which is located in neighboring Saginaw County. The Great Lakes Bay Region of Michigan is located in the eastern portion of Michigan’s lower peninsula, approximately 120 miles north of Detroit, is our primary market area for both lending and deposits. The Great Lakes Bay Region, with a population of over half a million residents, is a hub of research, product development, agribusiness and manufacturing for the auto, chemical, plastics, silicon, advanced materials and technology industries.  Wolverine Bank also does significant commercial real estate lending in the Metro Detroit, Greater Lansing and Greater Grand Rapids Regions.

Our operations tend to be influenced by the economic trends experienced throughout Michigan. Wolverine Bank competes for deposits with community banking institutions, credit unions and regional and superregional financial institutions with greater financial and other resources than we have. In recent years, both our primary market area as well as Michigan as a whole has experienced limited to negative growth, reflecting in part, the economic downturn. Future business and growth opportunities will be influenced by economic and demographic characteristics of our primary market area and of Michigan.

According to the United States Census Bureau, as of July 2015, the latest date for which the data is available, Midland County has a population of approximately 84,000 and Saginaw County has a population of approximately 200,000. This market area has experienced limited population growth from 2001 to 2015. Specifically, Midland County’s population remained nearly unchanged over the 2001 to 2015 period, while Saginaw County’s population shrank at a 1.8% compounded annual rate over the period. The foregoing demographic trends are projected to continue for both Saginaw and Midland Counties where modest population shrinkage is projected through 2016. Household growth trends coincide with the population growth trends as growth also has been modest over the 2001 to 2015 period. Households within Midland and Saginaw Counties, Michigan are expected to remain flat or shrink modestly over the next four year period.
 
Midland County’s per capita and median household income levels approximate Michigan and national averages. Conversely, per capita and household income levels were below these averages for Saginaw County in 2016. 
 
Historically, our primary market area, and specifically the City and County of Midland, has been heavily dependent upon the three largest employers: The Dow Chemical Company, MidMichigan Medical Center and Dow Corning Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company. These three entities employ approximately 8,500 persons in Midland County. The Dow Chemical Company is a major multinational producer of specialty chemicals, advanced materials, agro sciences technology-based products and solutions, and Dow Corning is a producer of silicone and a global leader in silicon-based technology and innovation. In addition, these companies have been in the forefront of the development and commercialization of solar energy products and technologies. Historically, these companies have been very important to the local economy because of the employment opportunities and their philanthropic and outgrowth activities.   
 
According to the Michigan Bureau of Labor Market Information and Strategic Initiatives, as of December 2016, unemployment rates in Midland County, the Bay City Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”) and the Saginaw MSA were 4.1%, 4.9% and 4.5%, respectively. The unemployment rate at December 31, 2016 for the State of Michigan was 5.0% and the national average was 4.7%. While there has been some improvement in the national unemployment rate over the last twelve months, Wolverine Bank’s primary market area continues to be significantly affected by the weaknesses in the national and Michigan economies, and any recovery is expected to be slow and prolonged.
 
Competition
 
We face intense competition in our market area both in making loans and attracting deposits. We compete with credit unions which historically have had a very strong presence in Michigan. We also compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and investment banking firms. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting customers, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. 
 
Specifically, we are subject to a high level of competition from two sources. Chemical Bank holds an approximate 67% share of commercial bank and thrift deposits in our market in Midland County as well as a significant market share in other contiguous markets. Additionally, the Dow Chemical Employees Credit Union operates through a single office in Midland and holds in excess of $1.3 billion of deposits. Thus, while the presence of Dow Chemical and Dow Corning corporate headquarters in Midland area provides high earnings and has limited the economic deterioration experienced in many similar Michigan jurisdictions, our ability to capture banking relationships from Dow employees is difficult due to the significant presence of these institutions.

Our deposit sources are primarily concentrated in the communities surrounding our banking offices located in the Great Lakes Bay Region of Michigan, including the Michigan counties of Midland and Saginaw. As of June 30, 2016, the latest date for which FDIC data are available, we ranked second of nine bank and thrift institutions with offices in Midland County with a 16.0% deposit market share. When including credit unions, which have a substantial deposit market share in our primary market area, we held approximately 7.8% of the total federally insured deposits in Midland County. We ranked 13 of 15 bank and thrift institutions with offices in Saginaw County with a 0.8% deposit market share. When including credit unions, our market share dropped to 0.4% of the federally insured deposits within Saginaw County.
 
Lending Activities
 
Our principal lending activity is the origination of commercial mortgage loans including multi-family and land loans, residential mortgage loans and home equity loans, construction loans, and to a lesser extent, commercial non-mortgage loans and other consumer loans. The following table provides a historical breakdown of our loan portfolio at the end of each of our last five years.

Commercial Real Estate, Multifamily and Land Loans. We originate commercial real estate mortgage loans, loans on multifamily dwellings and loans on undeveloped land. At December 31, 2016, $195.9 million, or 58.3% of our loan portfolio, consisted of commercial real estate loans, $54.8 million, or 16.3% of our loan portfolio, consisted of multifamily loans, and $11.5 million, or 3.4% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of land loans. Of the $195.9 million of commercial real estate loans, $35.4 million were secured by non-owner occupied one-to-four family rental properties.
 
We originate commercial real estate and multifamily loans secured primarily by office buildings, strip mall centers, owner-occupied offices, hotels, condominiums, apartment buildings and developed lots. At December 31, 2016, our commercial real estate, multifamily and land loans had an average loan balance of approximately $488,000. At December 31, 2016, substantially all of our commercial real estate, multifamily and land loans were secured by properties located in Michigan. On a limited basis to existing local customers of Wolverine Bank, we have made commercial real estate loans outside of Michigan, and at December 31, 2016 we had seven commercial real estate loans outside of Michigan, of which one was collateralized by land in Ohio with a loan balance of $231,000, one was collateralized by commercial property in Tennessee with a loan balance of $2.4 million, three were collateralized by commercial property in Florida with loan balances totaling $3.0 million, and two were collateralized by commercial property in Indiana with loan balances totaling $4.6 million. All commercial real estate loans outside of Michigan were performing in accordance with their repayment terms at December 31, 2016. 
 
Our commercial real estate, multifamily and land loans are generally written for terms of up to five years with a balloon payment at the end of the fifth year, with a 15 year amortization schedule. Our Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, and on a limited basis other commercial real estate loans, are originated with terms of up to 10 years. On occasion, we may make these types of loans with amortization terms of up to 25 years. The majority of our commercial real estate, multifamily and land loans have fixed interest rates. The rates on our adjustable-rate commercial real estate and multifamily loans are generally tied to the prime interest rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal.  Many of our adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans are not fully amortizing and, therefore, require a “balloon” payment at maturity. Our commercial real estate, multifamily and land loans are generally subject to prepayment penalties. A portion of our commercial real estate and multifamily loans represent permanent financing for borrowers who have completed real estate construction for which we previously provided construction financing. 
 
 
11



In underwriting commercial real estate and multifamily loans, we generally lend up to 70% of the property’s appraised value and up to 65% of the property’s appraised value if the property is unimproved land. On occasion, we may lend up to 80% of the appraised value on these types of loans. We base our decisions to lend on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, we emphasize the ratio of the property’s projected net cash flow to the loan’s debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum ratio of 120%), computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses we deem appropriate. Personal guarantees are typically obtained from commercial borrowers. We generally require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien, fire and extended coverage casualty insurance, and, if appropriate, flood insurance, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property.
 
Commercial real estate loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Commercial real estate loans, however, entail significant additional credit risks compared to one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the related real estate project, and thus may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the real estate market and in the general economy. Also, if we make a land acquisition loan on property that is not yet approved for the planned development, there is the risk that approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. At December 31, 2016, our largest commercial real estate loan had an outstanding balance of $6.0 million, was secured by various properties and was performing in accordance with its repayment terms. 
 
One-to-Four Family Residential Mortgage Loans. At December 31, 2016, $35.4 million, or 10.5% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of owner-occupied one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. We offer residential mortgage loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting standards (conforming loans) as well as non-conforming loans. We generally underwrite our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans based on the applicant’s employment and credit history and the appraised value of the subject property. We also offer loans through various agency programs which are originated for sale. 
 
We currently offer fixed-rate conventional mortgage loans with terms of up to 30 years that are fully amortizing with monthly loan payments, and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that generally provide an initial fixed interest rate for one year with annual interest rate adjustments thereafter, that amortize over a period up to 30 years. Private mortgage insurance is generally required for all of our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans that exceed an 80% loan-to-value ratio. At December 31, 2016, fixed-rate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans totaled $25.8 million, of which $5.7 million contained 5-year balloon payment terms, and adjustable-rate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans totaled $9.5 million.
 
Our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans are generally conforming loans, underwritten according to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guidelines. We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which is currently $417,000 for single-family homes in our market area. At December 31, 2016, we had four one-to-four family residential mortgage loans that had principal balances in excess of $417,000. At that date, our average one-to-four family residential mortgage loan had a principal balance of $102,000. We also originate loans above the lending limit for conforming loans, which we refer to as “jumbo loans.” Most of our jumbo loans are originated with a five-year fixed-rate term and a balloon payment, with up to a 30 year amortization schedule. Additionally, occasionally we will originate fixed-rate jumbo loans with terms of up to 30 years. At December 31, 2016, our largest one-to-four family residential mortgage loan had an outstanding balance of $626,000 and was performing in accordance with its repayment terms.

We actively monitor our interest rate risk position to determine the desirable level of investment in fixed-rate mortgages. In recent years there has been increased demand for long-term fixed-rate loans, as market rates have dropped and remained near historic lows. As a result, we have sold substantially all of our fixed-rate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans that do not contain balloon payment terms as these loans have all had terms of 15 years or greater. Generally, however, we retain in our portfolio fixed-rate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans with terms of less than 15 years, although this has represented a very small percentage of the fixed-rate loans that we have originated in recent years due to the favorable long-term rates for borrowers. 
 
We currently offer several types of adjustable-rate mortgage loans secured by residential properties with interest rates that are fixed for an initial period of one year. We offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans that are fully amortizing. After the initial fixed period, the interest rate on adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally resets every year based upon a contractual spread or margin above the one year Treasury Note, adjusted to a constant maturity, as published weekly by the Federal Reserve Board, subject to periodic and lifetime limitations on interest rate changes. Generally the initial change in interest rates on our adjustable-rate mortgage loans cannot exceed two percentage points, subsequent interest rate changes cannot exceed two percentage points and total interest rate changes cannot exceed six percentage points over the life of the loan. 
 
Adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally present different credit risks than fixed-rate mortgage loans, primarily because the underlying debt service payments of the borrowers increase as interest rates increase, thereby increasing the potential for default and higher rates of delinquency. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Since changes in the interest rates on adjustable-rate mortgages may be limited by an initial fixed-rate period or by the contractual limits on periodic interest rate adjustments, adjustable-rate loans may not adjust as quickly to increases in interest rates as our interest-bearing liabilities.
 
We do not offer or purchase loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. 
 
We generally require title insurance on all of our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, and we also require that borrowers maintain fire and extended coverage casualty insurance in an amount at least equal to the lesser of the loan balance or the replacement cost of the improvements. We also require flood insurance, as applicable. We do not conduct environmental testing on residential mortgage loans unless specific concerns for hazards are identified by the appraiser used in connection with the origination of the loan. 
 
Construction Loans. We also originate construction loans for one-to-four family residential properties and commercial properties, including multifamily properties. At December 31, 2016, $13.5 million, or 4.0%, of our total loan portfolio, consisted of construction loans, all of which were secured by one-to-four family residential real estate, multifamily loans, and commercial “mixed-use” buildings and homes.

We make construction loans for commercial properties, including multifamily loans and commercial “mixed-use” buildings and homes built by developers on speculation. Construction loans for commercial real estate are made in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of construction, and are generally limited to a 70% loan-to-completed appraised value ratio. We generally require that a commitment for permanent financing be in place prior to closing the construction loan. At December 31, 2016, our largest construction loan had a principal balance of $4.5 million and was secured by multi-family real estate. This loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms at December 31, 2016.
 
Construction loans for one-to-four family residential properties are originated with a maximum loan to value ratio of 70% and are generally “interest-only” loans during the construction period which typically does not exceed nine months. After this time period, the loan converts to permanent, amortizing financing following the completion of construction. Depending on the complexity of the construction project, we may choose to extend the term of an “interest-only” construction loan made on a one-to-four family residential property. At December 31, 2016, the additional unadvanced portion of these construction loans totaled $5.8 million. 
 
Repayment of loans on income-producing property is normally expected from the property’s eventual rental income, income from the borrower’s operations, the personal resources of the guarantor, or the sale of the subject property. Repayment of construction loans is usually expected from permanent financing upon completion of construction. We typically provide the permanent mortgage financing on our construction loans on income-producing property. 
 
Generally, before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by a state-certified or state-licensed appraiser. We review and inspect properties before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan.
 
Construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. Construction loans also expose us to the risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated.
 
Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. In addition to traditional one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, we offer home equity loans and home equity lines of credit that are secured by the borrower’s primary or secondary residence. Home equity loans and lines of credit are generally underwritten using the same criteria that we use to underwrite one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Home equity loans may be underwritten with a loan-to-value ratio of 80% when combined with the principal balance of the existing first mortgage loan. Our home equity loans are primarily originated with fixed rates of interest with terms of up to five years, a balloon payment, and a 15-year amortization schedule. Home equity lines of credit generally are originated with variable rates tied to the prime interest rate, with an established floor and monthly payments of 2.0% of the outstanding balance.
 
At December 31, 2016 we had $4.0 million, or 1.2% of our total loan portfolio, in home equity loans and $1.7 million of home equity lines of credit. The Bank had $1.9 million of undisbursed funds related to home equity lines of credit as of year-end. Our largest home equity loan was approximately $593,000.
 
 
14



Home equity loans secured by second mortgages have greater risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans secured by first mortgages. We face the risk that the collateral will be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses and costs of foreclosure. When customers default on their loans, we attempt to foreclose on the property and resell the property as soon as possible to minimize foreclosure and carrying costs. However, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from those customers. Particularly with respect to our home equity loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans. 
 
Commercial Non-Mortgage Loans. We also originate commercial non-mortgage (term) loans and variable lines of credit. These loans are generally originated to small- and medium-sized companies in our primary market area. Our commercial non-mortgage loans are generally used for working capital purposes or for acquiring equipment, inventory or furniture. These loans are primarily secured by business assets other than real estate, such as business equipment and inventory, accounts receivable or stock. The commercial non-mortgage loans that we offer have fixed interest rates or variable-rate indexed to the Prime Rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, and with terms ranging from one to seven years. Our commercial non-mortgage loan portfolio consists primarily of secured loans. 
 
At December 31, 2016, we had $20.0 million of commercial non-mortgage loans outstanding, representing 6.0% of our total loan portfolio.
 
When making commercial non-mortgage loans, we consider the financial statements, lending history and debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business and the value of the collateral, if any. Generally our loans are guaranteed by the principals of the borrower.
 
Commercial non-mortgage loans generally have a greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial non-mortgage loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial non-mortgage loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. Further, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. We seek to minimize these risks through our underwriting standards.
 
At December 31, 2016, our largest commercial non-mortgage loan outstanding was for $3.7 million and was secured by other collateral. At December 31, 2016, this loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms.
 
Consumer Loans. To a lesser extent, we offer a variety of consumer loans, including new and used automobile loans, recreational vehicle loans, and loans secured by certificates of deposits and other collateral, including marketable securities. At December 31, 2016, our consumer loan portfolio totaled $1.1 million, or 0.3% of our total loan portfolio.
 
Consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities.
 
 
15



Consumer and other loans generally have greater risk compared to longer-term loans secured by improved, owner-occupied real estate, particularly consumer loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. As a result, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. 
 
Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Participations and Servicing. Lending activities are conducted primarily by our loan personnel. All loans that we originate are underwritten pursuant to our standard policies and procedures. In addition, our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans generally incorporate Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines. We originate both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans. Our ability to originate fixed- or adjustable-rate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for such loans, which is affected by current market interest rates as well as anticipated future market interest rates. Our loan origination and sales activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment which typically results in decreased loan demand. Most of our commercial real estate and commercial non-mortgage loans are generated by our internal business development efforts and referrals from professional contacts. Most of our originations of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, consumer loans and home equity loans and lines of credit are generated by existing customers, referrals from realtors, residential home builders, walk-in business and from our website. 
 
Consistent with our interest rate risk strategy, in the low interest rate environment that has existed in recent years, we have sold on a servicing-released basis substantially all of the conforming, fixed-rate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans with maturities of 15 years or greater that we have originated. 
 
From time to time, we will purchase loan participations secured by properties within and outside of our primary market area in which we are not the lead lender. Historically, the loan participations have been secured by one-to-four family residential properties, commercial properties throughout Michigan, or business assets other than real estate. In these circumstances, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies. We have sufficient capital to take advantage of these opportunities to purchase loan participations, as well as strong relationships with other community banks in our primary market area and throughout Michigan that may desire to sell participations, and we intend to increase our purchases of participations in the future as a growth strategy. At December 31, 2016, our loan participations totaled $11.4 million, or 3.6% of our loan portfolio, all of which were collateralized by properties outside of our primary market area.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our Board of Directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower’s ability to repay, we review the borrower’s employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower. We will also evaluate a guarantor when a guarantee is provided as part of the loan. 
 
Wolverine Bank’s policies and loan approval limits are established by our Board of Directors. Our Manager of Commercial Underwriting may approve secured commercial loans up to $500,000 and unsecured loans up to $50,000.  Similarly, our Assistant Consumer Underwriter has authority to approve secured consumer loans up to $200,000 and saleable secured residential loans up to the secondary market limit (currently $417,000).  The President and CEO may approve secured loans up to $1.0 million and unsecured loans up to $500,000.  The President and CEO in combination with a Manager of Underwriting may approve secured loans up to $1,500,000 or unsecured loans up to $750,000, and these limits are increased to $2,000,000 (consumer or residential loans), $2,500,000 (commercial loans) and $1,000,000 (unsecured loans) with the addition of a second Manager of Underwriting.   Two or more board members may approve loans up to $3,500,000. All loans in excess of $3,500,000 must be approved by the Board of Directors. There is one other individual with lending authority, but at lower limits than stated above. There are higher limits for each lending authority described above for renewals or extensions.
 
 
17



We generally require appraisals by a rotating list of independent, licensed, third-party appraisers of all real property securing loans. All appraisers are approved by the Board of Directors annually.
 
Non-performing and Problem Assets
 
For all of our loans, once a loan is past its grace period, a computer generated past due notice is mailed. Past due notices continue to be mailed monthly in the event the account is not brought current. Prior to the time a loan is 30 days past due, we attempt to contact the borrower by telephone. Thereafter we continue with follow-up calls. Generally, once a loan becomes 90 days delinquent and no acceptable workout arrangement has been reach, we commence the foreclosure or repossession process. A summary report of all loans 90 days or more past due, or 30 days or more past due if the loan is less than 1 year old, is provided monthly to our Board of Directors.
 
Loans are usually placed on non-accrual status when the payment of principal and/or interest is 90 days or more past due. Loans are also placed on non-accrual status when it is determined collection of principal or interest is in doubt or if the collateral is in jeopardy. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received and only after the loan is returned to accrual status. The loans are typically returned to accrual status if unpaid principal and interest are repaid so that the loan is current.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, gross interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $647,000. We recognized interest income of $35,000 on such loans for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
 
At December 31, 2016, our non-accrual loans totaled $6.1 million. The non-accrual loans consisted primarily of five real estate relationships with principal balances totaling $9.1 million, $5.4 million net of charge-offs. These loans are secured primarily by developed land and commercial real estate properties. 
 
Other than as disclosed in the above tables, there are no other loans at December 31, 2016 that management has serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms. 
 
Troubled Debt Restructurings. Troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are defined under ASC 310-40 to include loans for which either a portion of interest or principal has been forgiven, or for loans modified at interest rates or on terms materially less favorable than current market rates. We periodically modify loans to extend the term or make other concessions to help borrowers stay current on their loans and to avoid foreclosure. We generally do not forgive principal or interest on loans or modify the interest rates on loans to rates that are below market rates. At December 31, 2016, we had $5.2 million of troubled debt restructurings, of which $4.4 million were included as non-accrual loans in the preceding table. At December 31, 2016 our troubled debt restructuring related to 11 loans, nine of which related to commercial real estate. As of December 31, 2016 accruing TDR loans totaled $0.3 million as compared to $0.2 million in December 31, 2015.

Total loans delinquent 60 or more days decreased $1.0 million to $2.0 million at December 31, 2016 from $3.0 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in delinquent loans was due primarily to a decrease of $0.8 million in total delinquent land loans. 
 
Real Estate Owned and Foreclosed Assets. Real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned. When property is acquired it is recorded at estimated fair market value at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Estimated fair value generally represents the sale price a buyer would be willing to pay on the basis of current market conditions, including normal terms from other financial institutions, less the estimated costs to sell the property. Holding costs and declines in estimated fair market value result in charges to expense after acquisition. In addition, we could repossess certain collateral, including automobiles and other titled vehicles, called other repossessed assets. At December 31, 2016, we had $86,000 in real estate owned.
 
Classification of Assets. Our policies, consistent with regulatory guidelines, provide for the classification of loans and other assets that are considered to be of lesser quality as substandard, doubtful, or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those assets characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets (or portions of assets) classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. Assets that do not expose us to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the afore-mentioned categories, but which possess potential weaknesses that deserve our close attention, are required to be designated as special mention. 
 
 
22



When we classify assets as either substandard or doubtful, we undertake an impairment analysis which may result in allocating a portion of our general loss allowances to a specific allowance for such assets as we deem prudent. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date. When we classify a problem asset as doubtful, we charge the asset off. For other classified assets, we provide a specific allowance for that portion of the asset that is considered uncollectible. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our loss allowances are subject to review by our principal federal regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which can require that we establish additional loss allowances. We review our asset portfolio on a monthly basis to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. 
 
The following table sets forth our amounts of classified assets, assets designated as special mention and criticized assets (classified assets and loans designated as special mention) at the dates indicated. At the dates presented we had no assets classified as doubtful.

Of the $7.6 million of substandard assets at December 31, 2016, $5.6 million were comprised of commercial real estate loans, $1.1 million were land loans, $0.8 million were one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, and $0.1 million were other real estate owned. . 
 
Allowance for Loan Losses 
 
Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses. Our allowance for loan losses is the amount considered necessary to reflect probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.
 
Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of two key elements: (1) specific allowances for identified problem loans; and (2) a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. 
 
Specific Allocations for Identified Problem Loans. We may establish a specific allocation for certain loans. Loss is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows, the loan’s observable market value, or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. Factors in identifying a specific problem loan include: (1) the strength of the customer’s personal or business cash flows; (2) the availability of other sources of repayment; (3) the amount due or past due; (4) the type and value of collateral; (5) the strength of our collateral position; (6) the estimated cost to sell the collateral; and (7) the borrower’s effort to cure the delinquency. In addition, for loans secured by real estate, we consider the extent of any past due and unpaid property taxes applicable to the property serving as collateral on the mortgage.
 
 
23



General Valuation Allowance on the Remainder of the Loan Portfolio. We establish a general allowance for loans that are not deemed impaired to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allocations, have not been allocated to particular problem loans. This general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience, delinquency trends and management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio. The allowance may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management’s judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. These significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary market area, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. The applied loss factors are re-evaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current real estate environment. Although our policy allows for a general valuation allowance on certain smaller-balance, homogenous pools of loans classified as substandard, we have historically evaluated every loan classified as substandard, regardless of size, for potential impairment.
 
In addition, as an integral part of their examination process, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agency may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination.
 
We periodically evaluate the carrying value of loans and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. While we use the best information available to make evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the information used in making the evaluations. 
 
The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the credit is well secured and in the process of collection. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.
 
All interest accrued but not collected for loans, including troubled debt restructurings, that are placed on nonaccrual status or charged off is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Generally, loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.

The allowance for loan losses decreased $0.8 million, or 7.9%, to $9.3 million at December 31, 2016 from $10.1 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in our allowance for loan losses was due in part to continued economic improvement, stabilized levels of non-performing assets, stabilized delinquencies and reduced specific allocations as a results of improved asset quality as well as improvement in our qualitative and environmental factors.

Investments
 
We conduct investment transactions in accordance with our board approved investment policy which is reviewed at least annually by the Audit Committee of the Board, and any changes to the policy are subject to ratification by the full Board of Directors. This policy dictates that investment decisions give consideration to the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, the ability to provide collateral for pledging requirements, minimizing exposure to credit risk, potential returns and consistency with our interest rate risk management strategy. Authority to make investments under approved guidelines is delegated to our management investment committee, comprised of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Operating Officer and Treasurer. All investments are reported to the Board of Directors for ratification at the next regular board meeting. 
 
Our current investment policy permits us to invest in any legally permissible investment security, including U.S. Treasury obligations, agency debt securities insured and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae and other eligible federal agencies, municipal securities, banker’s acceptances, certificates of deposit, overnight investments and eligible mutual funds. 
 
We do not engage in any speculative trading or any transactions in short sales, options, mortgage derivative products or other financial derivative products. In recent years, we have not purchased any mortgage-backed securities. As a federal savings bank, Wolverine Bank is generally not permitted to invest in equity securities, although this general restriction does not apply to Wolverine Bancorp, Inc., which may acquire up to 5% of voting securities of any company without regulatory approval.
 
ASC 320-10, “Investment – Debt and Equity Securities” requires that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held to maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent. Securities available for sale are reported at fair value, while securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. We do not maintain a trading portfolio. 
 
Municipal Obligations. At December 31, 2016, we held no municipal obligations. Our policy allows us to purchase municipal securities of credit-worthy issuers. We are not permitted to invest more than 2.0% of our total assets in municipal obligations. 
 
Investment Securities Portfolio. The following table sets forth the composition of our investment securities portfolio at the dates indicated, excluding Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis stock and federally insured interest-earning time deposits. All of such securities were classified as held-to-maturity.

Sources of Funds
 
General. Deposits traditionally have been our primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities. We also borrow, primarily from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, to supplement cash flow needs, to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management purposes and to manage our cost of funds. Our additional sources of funds are the proceeds from the sale of loans originated for sale, scheduled loan payments, maturing investments, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on other earning assets. 
 
Deposits. We generate deposits primarily from the areas in which our branch offices are located and from existing and prospective customers. We rely on our competitive pricing, convenient locations and customer service to attract and retain both retail and commercial deposits. Additionally, we have attracted deposits from numerous Michigan cities, townships, counties and nonprofit organizations due to our successful marketing efforts, community ties, and financial stability and strength. 
 
We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of savings accounts, checking accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit and retirement accounts. At December 31, 2016, we had $21.0 million in brokered deposits, of which $3.1 million was through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) network. When a customer makes a deposit and requests the full protection of FDIC insurance, but where such deposit exceeds applicable limits, we may use the CDARS network to place the funds into certificates of deposit issued by banks in the network so that the full amount of the deposit is insured by the FDIC. 
 
Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies, including the cost of alternate sources of funds, and market interest rates, liquidity requirements, interest rates paid by competitors and our deposit growth goals. 
 
At December 31, 2016, we had a total of $127.2 million in certificates of deposit, of which $75.4 million had remaining maturities of one year or less.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 
General
 
Wolverine Bank is supervised and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and is also subject to examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund and depositors, and not for the protection of stockholders. Under this system of federal regulation, financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates. Wolverine Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, which is one of the 12 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Wolverine Bank also is regulated to a lesser extent by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or Federal Reserve Board, which governs reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency examines Wolverine Bank and prepares reports for the consideration of its Board of Directors on any operating deficiencies. Wolverine Bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a much lesser extent, state law, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of Wolverine Bank’s loan documents.
 
Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on Wolverine Bancorp, Inc., Wolverine Bank and their operations. 
 
As a savings and loan holding company, Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board and to file certain reports with and is subject to examination by the Federal Reserve. Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) made extensive changes in the regulation of federal savings banks such Wolverine Bank. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Office of Thrift Supervision was eliminated. Responsibility for the supervision and regulation of federal savings banks was transferred to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is the agency that is primarily responsible for the regulation and supervision of national banks. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, responsibility for the regulation and supervision of savings and loan holding companies, such as Wolverine Bancorp, Inc., was transferred to the Federal Reserve Board, which supervises bank holding companies. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations, a function previously assigned to prudential regulators, and has authority to impose new requirements. However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as Wolverine Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the primary enforcement authority of, their prudential regulator rather than the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

The material regulatory requirements that are applicable to Wolverine Bank and Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. are described below. 
 
Dodd-Frank Act
 
The Dodd-Frank Act made significant changes to the regulatory structure for depository institutions and their holding companies, as well as changes that affect the lending, investments and other operations of all depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for both bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital for holding companies were restricted to capital instruments that were then currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. The legislation also established a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect upon passage, and directed the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as Wolverine Bank, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets are still examined for compliance by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also weakened the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations, and gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution, rather than on total deposits. The legislation also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. Further, the legislation requires that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans, directs the Federal Reserve Board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage originations.
 

Federal Banking Regulation 
 
Business Activities. A federal savings bank derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and the regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Under these laws and regulations, Wolverine Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. Wolverine Bank also may establish subsidiaries that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for Wolverine Bank, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage. 
 
Capital Requirements. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations require savings banks to meet three minimum capital standards: a 1.5% tangible capital ratio, a 4% leverage ratio (3% for savings banks receiving the highest rating on the CAMELS rating system), and an 8% risk-based capital ratio. 
 
 
32



The risk-based capital standard for savings banks requires the maintenance of Tier 1 (core) and total capital (which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 4% and 8%, respectively. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor of 0% to 200%, assigned by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Core capital is defined as common stockholders’ equity (including retained earnings), certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships. The components of supplementary capital include cumulative preferred stock, long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock, the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Overall, the amount of supplementary capital included as part of total capital cannot exceed 100% of core capital. Additionally, a savings bank that retains credit risk in connection with an asset sale may be required to maintain additional regulatory capital because of the purchaser’s recourse against the savings bank. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual associations where necessary. 
 
In July 2013, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that will revise their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the rule establishes a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), increases the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The final rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain “available-for-sale” securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-in or opt-out is exercised. The rule limits a banking organization’s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The final rule also implements the Dodd-Frank Act’s directive to apply to savings and loan holding companies consolidated capital requirements that are not less stringent than those applicable to their subsidiary institutions. The final rule was effective January 1, 2015. The “capital conservation buffer” will be phased in from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer will be effective.
 
At December 31, 2016 Wolverine Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements. See “Historical and Pro Forma Regulatory Capital Compliance.” 
 
Loans-to-One Borrower. Generally, a federal savings bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2016, we did not have any relationships in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. 
 
 
33



Capital Distributions. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings bank, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings bank’s capital account. A savings bank must file an application for approval of a capital distribution if:
 

● | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings bank’s net income for that year to date plus the savings bank’s retained net income for the preceding two years;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the savings bank would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or Office of the Comptroller of the Currency –imposed condition; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the savings bank is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings bank that is a subsidiary of a holding company must still file a notice with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency at least 30 days before the Board of Directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution.
 
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may disapprove a notice or application if:
 

● | the savings bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution, if after making such distribution the institution would be undercapitalized. A savings bank may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form.
 
Liquidity. A federal savings bank is required to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure its safe and sound operation. 
 
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All savings banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a federal savings bank, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to assess the savings bank’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. A savings bank’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. Wolverine Bank received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination. The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to publicly disclose their rating. 
 
 
34



Transactions with Related Parties. A federal savings bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations and by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing Regulation W promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as Wolverine Bank. Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. is an affiliate of Wolverine Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative and collateral requirements. In addition, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency requires savings banks to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates.
 
Wolverine Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders:
 

(a) | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Wolverine Bank’s capital.
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Wolverine Bank’s Board of Directors.
 
Enforcement. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings banks and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings bank. Formal enforcement action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order, to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution, and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or to recommend to the Director of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If action is not taken by the Director, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to take action under specified circumstances.
 
 
35



Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.
 
Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. Under prompt corrective action regulations, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks. For this purpose, a savings bank is placed in one of the following five categories based on the savings bank’s capital:
 

● | well-capitalized (at least 5% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% total risk-based capital);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adequately capitalized (at least 4% leverage capital, 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital and 8% total risk-based capital);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | undercapitalized (less than 3% leverage capital, 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital and 8% total risk-based capital);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | significantly undercapitalized (less than 3% leverage capital, 3% Tier 1 risk-based capital and 6% total risk-based capital); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | critically undercapitalized (less than 2% tangible capital).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
Generally, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings bank that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency within 45 days of the date a savings bank receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company of a savings bank that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to 5% of the savings bank’s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or the amount necessary to restore the savings bank to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency notifies the savings bank that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee. Failure by a holding company to provide the required guarantee will result in certain operating restrictions on the savings bank, such as restrictions on the ability to declare and pay dividends, pay executive compensation and management fees, and increase assets or expand operations. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 
 
At December 31, 2016, Wolverine Bank met the criteria for being considered “well-capitalized.”
 
 
36



Deposit Insurance. Wolverine Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts in Wolverine Bank are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor.
 
The FDIC imposes an assessment for deposit insurance on all depository institutions. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations, with less risky institutions paying lower rates. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from 2 ½ to 45 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC may increase or decrease the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking. The FDIC’s current system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution’s volume of deposits.
 
In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation is authorized to impose and collect, through the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the Financing Corporation are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the annualized Financing Corporation assessment was equal to 0.56 basis points of total assets less tangible capital.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC and the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-term fund ratio of 2%.
 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Wolverine Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. Management of Wolverine Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.
 
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Federal savings banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
 
Federal Home Loan Bank System. Wolverine Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, Wolverine Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2016, Wolverine Bank was in compliance with this requirement.
 
 
37



Qualified Mortgages and Retention of Credit Risk. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid legal liability under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower’s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this “qualified mortgage” definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s rule, a “qualified mortgage” loan must not contain certain specified features, including:
 

● | excessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less “bona fide discount points” for prime loans);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | interest-only payments;
--+------------------------


● | negative-amortization; and
--+---------------------------


● | terms longer than 30 years.
--+----------------------------

 
Also, to qualify as a “qualified mortgage,” a borrower’s total monthly debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive/and or time consuming to make these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability.
 
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the regulatory agencies to issue regulations that require securitizers of loans to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk for any asset that is not a “qualified residential mortgage.” The regulatory agencies have issued a proposed rule to implement this requirement. The Dodd-Frank Act provides that the definition of “qualified residential mortgage” can be no broader than the definition of “qualified mortgage” issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for purposes of its regulations (as described above). Although the final rule with respect to the retention of credit risk has not yet been issued, the final rule could have a significant effect on the secondary market for loans and the types of loans we originate, and restrict our ability to make loans.
 

Other Regulations
 
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Wolverine Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Wolverine Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 

● | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
38




● | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Truth in Savings Act; and
--+--------------------------


● | rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The operations of Wolverine Bank also are subject to the:
 

● | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated there under, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The USA PATRIOT Act, which requires savings banks to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, and due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements that also apply to financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.

Holding Company Regulation
 
General. Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. is a non-diversified savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. As such, Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. is registered with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. and its non-insured subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. 
 
 
39



Permissible Activities. The business activities of Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. The Dodd-Frank Act added that any savings and loan holding company that engages in activities permissible for a financial holding company must meet the qualitative requirements for a bank holding company to be a financial holding company and conduct the activities in accordance with the requirements that would apply to a financial holding company’s conduct of the activity. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and certain additional activities authorized by Federal Reserve Board regulations.
 
Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including Wolverine Bancorp, Inc., directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board. It also prohibits the acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a nonsubsidiary company engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking or financial in nature, or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.

Capital. Savings and loan holding companies have not historically been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. However, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to set for all depository institution holding companies minimum consolidated capital levels that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implements the Dodd-Frank Act as to savings and loan holding companies. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions apply to savings and loan holding companies as of January 1, 2015. As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer will be phased in between 2016 and 2019.

Dividends. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy guidance regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies that it has made applicable to savings and loan holding companies as well. In general, the Federal Reserve Board’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Federal Reserve Board guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition.  The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized.  These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
 
Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The regulatory agencies must issue regulations requiring that all bank and savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.

TAXATION
  
Federal Taxation
 
General. Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. and Wolverine Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. and Wolverine Bank.
 
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries currently report income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting with a tax year ending December 31st for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves by savings institutions, effective for taxable years beginning after 1995.
 
Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, referred to as “alternative minimum taxable income.” The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount. Net operating losses can, in general, offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. At December 31, 2016, Wolverine Bank had no minimum tax credit carryforward. 
 
Corporate Dividends. We may exclude from our income 100% of dividends received from Wolverine Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
 
Audit of Tax Returns. Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries’ federal income tax returns have not been audited in the most recent five-year period.
