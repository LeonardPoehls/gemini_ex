ITEM 1.        BUSINESS
Emerge Energy Services LP (“Emerge”) is a Delaware limited partnership that completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) on May 14, 2013 to become a publicly traded partnership. The combined entities of Superior Silica Sands LLC (“SSS”), a Texas limited liability company, and Allied Energy Company LLC (“AEC”), an Alabama limited liability company, represent the predecessor for accounting purposes (the “Predecessor”) of Emerge.
Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, Insight Equity Management Company LLC and its affiliated investment funds and its controlling equity owners, Ted W. Beneski and Victor L. Vescovo (collectively “Insight Equity”) conveyed all of the interests in SSS and AEC to the Partnership as a capital contribution, and the Partnership conveyed its interests in SSS and AEC to the Partnership's subsidiary Emerge Energy Services Operating LLC (“Emerge Operating”), a Delaware limited liability company. In addition, the Partnership formed Emerge Energy Distributors Inc. (“Distributor”), a Delaware corporation, and purchased Direct Fuels LLC (“Direct Fuels”), a Delaware limited liability company, through a combination of cash, issuance of common units, and assumption of debt, and the Partnership conveyed all of the interest in Direct Fuels to Emerge Operating. Therefore, the historical financial statements contained in this Form 10-K reflect the combined assets, liabilities and operations of the Partnership, SSS and AEC for periods ending before May 14, 2013 and the assets, liabilities and operations of the Partnership and all of its subsidiaries for periods beginning on or after May 14, 2013.
On August 31, 2016, Emerge completed the sale of its Fuel business pursuant to an Amended and Restated Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated August 31, 2016 (the “Restated Purchase Agreement”), with Susser Petroleum Operating Company LLC and Sunoco LP (together, “Sunoco”). Sunoco paid Emerge a purchase price of approximately $167.7 million in cash (subject to certain working capital and other adjustments in accordance with the terms of the Restated Purchase Agreement), of which $14.25 million is placed into several escrow accounts to satisfy potential claims from Sunoco for indemnification under the Restated Purchase Agreement. Any escrowed funds remaining after certain periods of time set forth in the Restated Purchase Agreement will be released to Emerge, provided that no unsatisfied indemnity claims exist at such time.
References to the “Partnership,” “we,” “our” or “us” when used for dates or periods ended prior to the IPO, refer collectively to the Predecessor. References to the “Partnership,” “we,” “our” or “us” when used for dates or periods ended on or after the IPO, refer collectively to Emerge and all of its subsidiaries.
Overview
We are a publicly-traded limited partnership formed in 2012 by management and affiliates of Insight Equity to own, operate, acquire, and develop a diversified portfolio of energy service assets.
The results of operations of the Fuel business have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. We now operate our continuing business in a single sand segment. We are engaged in the businesses of mining, processing, and distributing silica sand, a key input for the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells. 
The Fuel business operated transmix processing facilities located in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and in Birmingham, Alabama.  The Fuel business also offered third-party bulk motor fuel storage and terminal services, biodiesel refining, sale and distribution of wholesale motor fuels, reclamation services (which consists primarily of cleaning bulk storage tanks used by other petroleum terminal and others) and blending of renewable fuels. 
We conduct our Sand operations through our subsidiary SSS. We believe that our subsidiary brand has significant name recognition and a strong reputation with our customers.
Our principal offices are located at 6000 Western Place, Suite 465, Fort Worth, Texas 76107. Our telephone number is (817) 618-4020 and our website address is www.emergelp.com.
Business Strategies
During 2016, we took numerous steps to improve our financial position and lower our outstanding balance on the revolver. In order to improve our competitive positioning and retain upside for the eventual recovery in the oil and gas cycle, we divested our Fuel business which helped reduce our debt burden. We recorded a gain of $31.7 million on the sale of the Fuel business and paid down $154.0 million of our outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Concurrently, we restructured our amended and restated revolving credit and security agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) among Emerge Energy Services LP, as parent guarantor, each of its subsidiaries, as borrowers (the “Borrowers”), and PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and collateral agent (the “agent”), and the lenders thereto to align our balance sheet and covenants to our needs.

On August 8, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with an institutional investor (the “Purchaser”) to issue and sell to the Purchaser in a private placement (the “Private Placement”) an aggregate principal amount of $20 million of our Series A Preferred Units (the “Preferred Units”) and a warrant (the “Warrant”) that may be exercised to purchase common units (the “Warrant Units”) representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The net proceeds of $18.4 million were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement.
In November 2016, we completed a public offering of 3,400,000 of our common units at a price of $10.00 per unit and granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 510,000 common units, which the underwriter exercised in full. The offering closed on November 23, 2016. We received proceeds (net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses) from the offering of approximately $36.9 million. The net proceeds from this offering was used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement.
During 2016, we completed negotiations with various railcar lessors pursuant to which we terminated a future order of railcars, deferred future railcar deliveries and reduced and deferred payments on existing leases. We have negotiated, and continue to negotiate, price concessions and purchase commitment concessions from our major vendors, such as railcar lessors, rail transportation providers, mine operators, transload facilities operators, and professional services providers.
The primary components of our business strategy are:

• | Focus on profitability and improving financial condition. We are applying financial discipline to all aspects of our business with the primary goals of reducing costs, minimizing capital expenditures, restructuring our long-term lease and purchase commitments, realigning our human resource capital, idling our higher costs plants when necessary, and accelerating the introduction of technology-based sand products that could improve our financial performance. These strategy efforts include, but are not limited to: 


• | minimizing the overall cost of sand sold by finding the lowest cost combinations of sand source, production location and transportation providers wherever possible;


• | continuing to negotiate price concessions and purchase commitment concessions from our major vendors, such as railcar lessors, rail transportation providers, mine operators, transload facilities operators, and professional services providers (we completed several railcar lease and transload agreement restructurings during 2016);


• | demonstrating, through field trials and sales, the value proposition of our Self-Suspending Sand, SandMaxX™, which we also believe will result in higher profit margins.


• | Capitalize on the current market recovery. After oil and gas prices stabilized in the second half of 2016, North American onshore oil and gas producers have publicly communicated plans to substantially increase drilling and completion activity in 2017. A corresponding rebound in frac sand consumption will be needed in the energy services supply chain, and we plan on growing our business in 2017 through the market’s recovery and by increasing our market share. We are strategically ramping up utilization of our mines and dry plants to meet the higher demand projected for 2017 while also recovering price concessions made during the downturn in 2015 and 2016. 


• | Optimize existing assets. We intend to focus on efforts that complement our existing asset base or provide attractive returns in new geographic areas or business lines. We have three Northern White dry plant facilities located in Wisconsin and an additional dry plant facility located in Kosse, TX. To reduce costs in 2016, we temporarily idled some of our higher cost operations in Wisconsin, and these plants are back in operation in 2017. If demand for our products continues to improve as it did during the second half of 2016, we are currently ramping up utilization of our mining and production operations in 2017 to meet customers’ orders. 


• | Introduce new products serving our core end users. We intend to increase our presence and market share in frac sand end markets that we believe are poised for growth. In September 2015, we introduced a unique, technically advanced proppant to the oil and gas industry and began selling the product in 2016. This dustless proppant, brand named SandGuard™, improves the handling, in-basin management, and job-site implementation of the hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells. Silica sands can potentially release dust particles into the air that are harmful to personnel when exposed in large quantities, so mechanical dust collection systems act to remove silica dust from the workplace. Our SandGuard™ dustless product eliminates the need for expensive dust collection systems at the wellsite or at a transload terminal. With a SandGuard™ treatment facility in Barron County, Wisconsin, we have the ability to enhance the already strong qualities of its Northern White silica sand with the protective coating to help create a safer work environment for our customers’ employees. 

In November 2015, we acquired 11 patents and other intellectual property assets from AquaSmart Enterprises LLC for their Self-Suspending Sand technology. The product brand is marketed as SandMaxX™. While subject to ongoing field testing that began in 2016 and data validation, this new technology offers the potential to increase productivity and completion efficiencies in oil and gas wells while improving pump time, and well site economics. At our Barron dry 
2

plant, we have a pilot production circuit capable of producing in excess of 175,000 tons per year of SandMaxX™ product. This pilot production circuit uses proprietary and patented technology to coat all grades of standard frac sand. SandMaxX™ was pumped downhole in 26 different trial wells during 2016, and while the early results appear favorable, we are working closely with our customers to confirm and document actual well performance data in addition to comparing the results against wells completed with regular sand. Our plans for constructing a commercial scale coating plant depend upon the successful completion of the field trial testing and achieving market acceptance of the product. 

• | Focus on customer contracts. We are constantly working to secure or renew long-term take-or-pay, fixed-volume, and efforts-based contracts with existing and new customers in order to cover the substantial majority of our production capacity. In 2016, total sales to customers under long-term contracts, including efforts-based, fixed-volume, and take-or-pay arrangements, accounted for 62% of our sand sales volumes. As of December 31, 2016, we had 6.4 million tons under long-term contract, primarily efforts-based arrangements, with a weighted average remaining of approximately four years. 


• | Capitalize on industry fundamentals. The demand for frac sand decreased in 2015 and the first half of 2016 as North American drilling activity declined in response to falling oil and gas prices. Rig count reductions were partially offset by a higher number of wells drilled per operating rig and an increase in sand intensity per well drilled or completed. After nearly two years of declining oil and gas prices beginning in the middle of 2014, the prospects for the oil and gas industry improved in the second half of 2016 as production declines and planned production cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) helped to stabilize energy prices. We believe that the frac sand industry is poised to grow in 2017, and we continue to believe the frac sand market offers attractive long-term growth fundamentals. 


• | Grow business through strategic and accretive business or asset acquisitions. Financial performance and condition permitting, we plan to selectively pursue accretive acquisitions in our areas of operation that we believe will allow us to realize operational efficiencies by capitalizing on our existing infrastructure, personnel and commercial relationships in energy services, and we may also seek acquisitions in new geographic areas or complementary business lines. In December 2015, we acquired the rights to mine high quality northern white silica sand reserves in Jackson County, Wisconsin. We have not engaged an expert to assess the volume and quality of these sand reserve rights. This transaction not only provides us with future access to high quality sand reserves, but also strengthens our position in the marketplace with a leading pressure pumper across a number of shale plays in North America. We currently do not have plans to develop this property in the immediate future. 


• | Distributions. While Amendment No. 11 to the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement limits our ability to make distributions to our unitholders, our board of directors of our general partner remains committed to resuming distributions as our financial condition allows. 

Competitive Strengths
We believe that we are well positioned to successfully execute our business strategies because of the following competitive strengths:

• | High quality, strategically located assets. We currently operate several scalable frac sand production facilities in and around Barron County, Wisconsin and Kosse, Texas. Our facilities in Wisconsin are supported by approximately 76.9 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves and our facility in Texas is supported by approximately 27.1 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves. We believe that our Wisconsin and Texas reserves provide us access to a balanced amount of coarse sand (16/30, 20/40, and 30/50 mesh sands) and fine sand (40/70 and 100 mesh) compared to other frac sand producers. Our sample boring data and production data indicated that our Wisconsin reserves contain deposits of nearly 35% 40 mesh or coarser substrate, with our Barron reserves being comprised of more than 60% 50 mesh or coarser substrate. Our mine deposits in Wisconsin can be targeted to extract finer grades when the market dictates such demand is wanted, as is the current trend. Also, our Kosse, TX operation primarily consists of fine sand product, which affords us significant flexibility of serving our customers with their desired product type needs. 


• | Logistics. The logistics capabilities of our Wisconsin facilities enable us to serve the major United States and Canadian oil and natural gas producing basins, as well as provide us with economical access to Mexico and South America. Our New Auburn facility is connected to a rail line owned by Union Pacific, and our Barron facility is connected to the Canadian National rail line. Between our two Wisconsin rail yards, we have storage space for approximately 1000 railcars. Our Baron and New Auburn dry plant facilities can accommodate unit trains. As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 5,573 railcars in our fleet, including 287 dedicated customer cars and 5,286 railcars under lease with a weighted average remaining term of 5.2 years. As of December 31, 2016, we had 14 transload facilities in North America, each of which is positioned to serve a number of our target markets. 


• | Competitive operating cost structure. We believe that our operations are characterized by an overall low cost structure which allows us to capture attractive margins in the industries in which we operate. Our low cost structure is a result of the following key attributes: 

3


• | close proximity of our silica sand reserves to our processing plants, which reduces operating costs;


• | expertise in designing, building, maintaining and operating advanced frac sand processing, storage and loading facilities;


• | a large proportion of the costs we incur in our production of sand are only incurred when we produce saleable frac sand;


• | open dialogue with key vendors allowing for cost reduction in down markets;


• | proximity to major sand and logistics infrastructure, minimizing transportation and fuel costs, and headcount needs;


• | competitive mineral royalty expenses;


• | enclosed dry plant operations which allow full run rates during winter months, thereby increasing plant utilization; and


• | a diversified and growing customer base spread across nearly every major shale play in North America.

In addition to these capabilities, we have taken a number of proactive steps to further lower our operating costs, including upgrading equipment at our Kosse, Texas facility, refining our mining techniques at our Barron county mines and wet plants. We began using new lower cost mining techniques at two of our Wisconsin mines in the third quarter of 2015, and introduced these techniques to our Kosse mine in July 2016. We also introduced new processing techniques at our Kosse plant in the third quarter of 2015 that allowed us to inexpensively extract significant amounts of saleable frac sand from previously mined and discarded waste streams.

• | Strong reputation with our customers, suppliers and other constituencies. Our management and operating teams have developed longstanding relationships with our customers, suppliers, and other constituencies. Based on our track record of dependability, timely delivery and high-quality products that consistently meet customer specifications, we believe that we are well positioned to secure additional contracted commitments in the future, and that our product mix and customer service will continue to benefit our reputation within the frac sand industry. 


• | Experienced management team with industry specific operating and technical expertise. Our senior management team has extensive industry experience in managing and operating industrial mineral production facilities. They have managed numerous frac sand mining and processing plants, successfully led acquisitions in the industry and developed multiple greenfield industrial mineral processing facilities. We believe that our customers value our commitment to customer service, our reliable delivery, and our focus on high-quality product. 

Sand Business
Our Sand business mines, processes and distributes high quality silica sand, a key input for the hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells. Our Wisconsin facilities consist of three dry plants located in Arland, Barron and New Auburn, Wisconsin with a total permitted capacity of 6.3 million finished tons per year, and five wet plants and mine complexes that supply the dry plants with Northern White silica sand, which we believe is the highest quality raw frac sand available. We also have a fourth dry plant in Kosse, Texas, with a capacity of 600,000 tons per year that is supplied by a separate mine and wet plant that processes local Texas sand. As of December 31, 2016, we also had 14 transload facilities located throughout North America in the key basins where we deliver our sand, as well as a fleet of 5,573 railcars. 
Our Sand business experienced rapid growth from 2011 to 2014 due to technological advances in horizontal drilling and the hydraulic fracturing process that have made the extraction of large volumes of oil and natural gas from domestic unconventional hydrocarbon formations economically feasible. Demand for frac sand decreased during 2015 and 2016 as a result of the industry downturn, but we saw early signs of a recovery near the end of 2016. We believe that the premium geologic characteristics of our Wisconsin sand reserves, the strategic location of our sand mines, our location on multiple Class One rail lines, our extensive transload and logistics network, the industry experience of our senior management team, and the reputation that SSS has with our customers position us as a highly attractive source of frac sand to the oil and natural gas industry. 
The production of our sand consists of three basic processes: mining, wet plant operations, and dry plant operations. All mining activities take place in an open pit environment, whereby we remove the topsoil, which is set aside, and then remove other non-economic minerals, or “overburden,” to expose the sand deposits. We then “bump” the sand using explosives on the mine face, which causes the sand to fall into the pit, where it is then carried by truck to the wet plant operations. We also utilize a process called hydraulic mining whereby we use high pressure water cannons to dislodge the sandstone, and transport the sand and water mixture via pipeline to the wet plant. Where the geology is suitable, this technique minimizes the use of heavy excavation machinery, thereby lowering operating costs. Once we have mined out a portion of the reserves, we then either return the land to its previous contours or to a more usable contour, and then replace the topsoil. At our wet plant, the mined sand goes through a series of 
4

processes designed to separate the sand from unusable materials. The resulting wet sand is then conveyed to a wet sand stockpile where most of the water is allowed to drain into our on-site recycling facility, while the remaining fine grains and other materials, if any, are separated through a series of settlement ponds. We reuse all of the water that does not evaporate in our wet process. Wet sand from our stockpile is then conveyed or trucked to our dry plants where the sand is dried, screened into specific mesh categories, and stored in silos. From the silos, we load sand directly into railcars or trucks, which we then ship to one of our transload facilities or directly to one of our customers.
Our frac sand facilities are located in Barron County and Chippewa County, Wisconsin and Kosse, Texas. Based on the reports of third-party independent engineering firms, we have approximately 104.0 million tons of proven recoverable reserves. We are currently capable of producing up to 8.8 million tons and 6.9 million tons of wet and dry sand per year, respectively, from our current facilities. We believe that the coarseness, conductivity, sphericity, acid-solubility, and crush-resistant properties of our Wisconsin reserves and our facilities' connectivity to rail and other transportation infrastructure afford us an advantage over our competitors and make us one of a select group of sand producers capable of delivering high volumes of frac sand that is optimal for oil and natural gas production to all major unconventional resource basins currently producing throughout North America and abroad.
Our Wisconsin sand reserves give us access to a range of high-quality sand that meets or exceeds all API specifications and includes a mix between concentrations of coarse grades (16/30, 20/40 and 30/50 mesh sands) and finer grades (40/70 and 100 mesh). While our Wisconsin reserves provide us access to a high amount of coarse sand compared to other Northern White deposits located in Wisconsin's Jordan, St. Peter, and Wonewoc formations, we have the ability to target certain locations in our deposits to obtain finer sands. Our sample boring data and our historical production data have indicated that our Wisconsin reserves contain deposits of nearly 35% 40 mesh or coarser substrate, with our FLS, Church Road, LP Mine and Thompson Hills reserves being comprised of more than 60% 50 mesh or coarser substrate. We are also one of a select number of mine operators that can offer commercial amounts of 16/30 mesh sand, the coarsest grade of widely-used frac sand on the market. Our Wisconsin dry plants are fully enclosed, which means that we are capable of running year-round, regardless of the weather. Under normal market conditions, we operate our Wisconsin plants with work crews of four to six employees. These crews work 40-hour weeks, with shifts between eight and twelve hours, depending on the employee's function. Because raw sand cannot be wet-processed during extremely cold temperatures, we typically mine and wet-process frac sand eight months out of the year at our Wisconsin locations.
Our mine, wet plant, and dry plant in Kosse, Texas operate year-round. The reserves primarily consist of finer mesh grades, which strategically complement the coarser grades from our Wisconsin deposits. We operate our Kosse facilities with crews of four to six employees who work twelve-hour shifts and average 40 hours per week. This allows us to optimize facility utilization.
Each of our facilities undergoes regular maintenance to minimize unscheduled downtime, and to ensure that the quality of our frac sand meets applicable ISO and API standards and our customers' specifications. In addition, we make capital investments in our facilities as required to support customer demand, and our internal performance goals.
The following table provides information regarding our frac sand production facilities as of December 31, 2016.

Mineral Reserves
We believe that our strategically located mines and facilities provide us with a large and high-quality mineral reserve base. The coarseness and conductivity of the Northern White frac sand that we mine in Wisconsin significantly enhances recovery of oil and liquids-rich gas by allowing hydrocarbons to flow more freely than would be possible with competing native sand. The low acid-solubility increases the integrity of the Northern White sand relative to other proppants with higher acid-solubility, especially in shales where hydrogen sulfide and other acidic chemicals are co-mingled with the targeted hydrocarbons. In addition, its crush resistant properties enable Northern White frac sand to be used in deeper drilling applications than the frac sand produced from mineral deposits located in Texas, Arkansas, or other southern United States locations. 
We categorize our reserves as proven recoverable in accordance with SEC definitions and have further limited the definition to apply only to sand reserves that we believe could be extracted at an average cost that is economically feasible. According to such a definition, we estimate that we had a total of approximately 104 million tons of proven recoverable mineral reserves as of December 31, 2016. The quantity and nature of the mineral reserves at each of our properties are estimated first by third-party geologists and mining engineers and we internally track the depletion rate on an interim basis. Cooper Engineering Company, Inc. prepared estimates of our proven mineral reserves at our Wisconsin mine locations, while Westward Environmental, Inc. prepared estimates of our proven mineral reserves at our Kosse facility, each as of December 31, 2016. Our external geologists and engineers update our reserve estimates annually, making necessary adjustments for operations at each location during the year and additions or surveying, drill core analysis and other tests to confirm the quantity and quality of the acquired reserves.
Our mineral reserve leases in Wisconsin with third-party landowners expire at various times between 2036 and 2038. We do not anticipate any issues in renewing these leases should we decide to do so. Consistent with industry practice, we conduct only limited investigations of title to our properties prior to leasing. Title to lands and reserves of the lessors or grantors and the boundaries of our leased properties are not completely verified until we prepare to mine those reserves.
Mines and Wet Plants
The deposits found in our open-pit Wisconsin-based mines are Cambrian quartz sandstone deposits that produce high-quality Northern White frac sand and have a minimum silica content of approximately 99%. Mining takes place in phases lasting from six months to one year in duration, after which the property is reclaimed in a manner that typically provides the landowners with additional cropland. 
New Auburn
Our New Auburn wet plant can process up to 2 million tons of wet sand per year. It is located in Chippewa County, Wisconsin, 12 miles from our New Auburn dry plant, to which we have year-round trucking access. The mine site consists of approximately 418 acres adjacent to our New Auburn wet plant. The site contains 15.5 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves. 
In 2011, we awarded Fred Weber, Inc. (“Fred Weber”) a five-year contract for the entirety of our Auburn mining operations and for a portion of our wet processing needs at that facility. Under this contract, Fred Weber financed and built the wet plant at our Auburn facility. We amended and extended this contract on January 1, 2015, which now expires in December 31, 2021. Fred Weber now mines the sand reserves, creates stockpiles of washed sand, and maintains the plant and equipment at Auburn. We agreed, under a take-or-pay arrangement, to purchase 500,000 tons of washed sand from Fred Weber each year that the plant is in operation. We pay Fred Weber a set price per ton of washed sand, subject to adjustments each operational year for diesel prices, the quality of the sand mined, and the quantity of sand purchased. During the term of the agreement Fred Weber will own the wet plant along with the equipment and other temporary structures used for mining on the property. At the end of the term of the agreement or following a default under the contract by Fred Weber, we have the right to take ownership of the wet plant and other mining equipment without charge. Subject to certain conditions, ownership of the plant and equipment will transfer from Fred Weber to us at the expiration of the term. The contract was suspended for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the suspension period, we were responsible for mine upkeep and maintenance. The contract resumed on January 1, 2017.

Thompson Hills
Our Thompson Hills wet plant can process up to 1.6 million tons of wet sand per year. It is located 15 miles from our New Auburn dry plant and 26 miles from our Barron dry plant. The mine site is situated on 580 acres and consists of a series of seven leases in Barron County, Wisconsin. The site contains 40.9 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves. 
We completed construction of the mine and wet plant in September 2014. We incorporated two features into the wet plant that we believe provide the plant with higher quality sand within a more environmentally sound footprint. The first is that we wash our sand both before and after we run the wet sand through the hydrosizer. The resulting sand has turbidity that is the lowest of any wet plant with which we are familiar, which results in less fugitive dust both at our facilities and at the drilling site for our customers. The second is that we separate our fines and other unusable material without the use of settling ponds, which enables us to use less water in our wet plant. Hydraulic mining was implemented at this site during the third quarter of 2015, reducing our mining costs. 
FLS mine
Our FLS wet plant can process up to 1.2 million tons of wet sand per year. It is located 12 miles from our Barron dry plant. The mine site is situated on 364 acres and consists of a series of five adjacent mineral deposits in Barron County, Wisconsin. The site contains 10.3 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves. 
Church Road
Our Church Road wet plant can process up to 1.2 million tons of wet sand per year. It is located less than one mile from our Arland dry plant. The mine site is situated on 130 acres. The site contains 5.3 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves. 
LP Mine
Our LP wet plant can process up to 1.2 million tons of wet sand per year. It is located 2 miles from our Arland dry plant. The mine site is situated on 145 acres. The site contains 4.9 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves. Hydraulic mining was implemented at this site during the third quarter of 2015.
Kosse
We own the mineral rights to a 225 acre mineral deposit located in Kosse, Texas, adjacent to our Kosse dry plant. The deposit has a minimum silica content of approximately 99% and controlling attributes that include sand grain crush strength and size distribution. As of December 31, 2016, the Kosse mineral deposit contained 27.1 million tons of proven recoverable reserves which we process into a high-quality, 100 mesh frac sand. The wet plant at our Kosse facility is capable of producing up to 1.6 million tons of wet sand per year. We are not obligated to make royalty payments in connection with our mining operations at this location. We use heavy equipment to mine sand from the open-pit. We introduced hydraulic mining techniques to our Kosse mine in 2016. 
Future Projects
In December 2015, we acquired the rights to mine high quality northern white silica sand reserves in Jackson County, Wisconsin from a subsidiary of Performance Technologies, L.L.C (“PTL”), which is wholly-owned by Seventy Seven Energy Inc. (NYSE: SSE). We have not engaged an expert to assess the volume and quality of these sand reserve rights. The assets acquired include certain owned and leased land, sand deposit leases and related prepaid royalties, and transferable mining and reclamation permits.  This transaction strengthens our position in the marketplace with a leading pressure pumper across a number of shale plays in North America. In consideration for the assets, PTL and SSS amended and restated the existing supply agreement between the parties and entered into a new sand purchase option agreement that provides PTL with a market-based discount on sand purchased from SSS. Under the new agreements with PTL, SSS has the option to supply the contracted tons from its existing footprint of northern white sand operations or construct a new sand mine and dry plant in Jackson County, Wisconsin.  We currently do not have plans to develop this property in the near future.
Dry Plant Facilities
Arland 
Our Arland dry plant is located in the township of Arland in Barron County, Wisconsin on 22 acres that we own. The facility is located on a county road, which gives us year-round trucking access, and is situated 11 miles from our Barron facility, and 37 miles from our New Auburn facility. Our Arland dry plant is an enclosed facility that has a rated production capacity of 8,800 tons per day year-round and regardless of weather conditions. Our current air permit allows us to produce up to 3.5 million tons per year of finished product. The facility has a 300 ton per hour natural gas fired rotary dryer as well as twelve high capacity gyratory mineral separators, or (“screeners”), that are capable of producing up to 2.5 million tons per year. Our finished product is transported via truck to one of our dry plant facilities with rail access or to a third-party rail loadout facility located in Minnesota.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, our Arland facility produced approximately 0.2 million tons of Northern White frac sand. In January 2016, we temporarily idled the Arland plant due to the challenging market conditions and higher cost structure as compared to our other dry plants. However, we resumed consistent production in October 2016, and the plant was operating at a high level of utilization to start 2017.
Barron
Our Barron dry plant is located in the township of Clinton, Wisconsin in Barron County on 83 acres that we own. The facility is located on a US Highway, which gives us year-round trucking access, and is situated along a rail spur owned by the Canadian National (“CN”) railway that connects to the CN main line. Our Barron dry plant is an enclosed facility that has a rated production capacity of 8,800 tons per day year-round regardless of weather conditions, and has on-site railcar loading facilities. Our current air permit allows us to produce up to 2.4 million tons per year of finished product. The facility has a 300 ton per hour natural gas fired rotary dryer as well as twelve high capacity screeners. Our railyard at Barron consists of 18 spur tracks and is capable of storing up to 650 railcars. 
Our location on the CN rail spur allows us to offer direct access to the rapidly growing oil and gas shale plays in northwestern Canada and the northeastern United States, including the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, the Marcellus Shale, and the Utica Shale plays. The CN also presents us with access to emerging plays in the southern United States as well as the port of New Orleans, which provides us access to emerging oil and gas markets in Latin America. 
The Barron facility houses our technology-driven proppant (SandGuard™ and SandMaxX™) production circuits. In late 2015, we installed equipment that applies coating material for our SandGuard™ product. Our SSP pilot plant upgrade is currently under construction and will provide production of SandMaxX™ in limited quantities until the technology is tested in the field. If the technology proves successful and widely demanded by our customers, we will evaluate a larger-scale upgrade to an existing facility. 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, our Barron facility produced 1.6 million tons of Northern White sand.
New Auburn
Our New Auburn dry plant is located in Barron County, Wisconsin, approximately 12 miles from our New Auburn mine. The facility is on 37 acres that we own in the village of New Auburn, Wisconsin along a short line that connects with the mainline of the Union Pacific (“UP”) railway. Our New Auburn dry plant is an enclosed facility that has a rated production capacity of 4,400 tons per day year-round regardless of weather conditions, and has on-site railcar loading facilities capable of loading railcars. Our current air permit allows us to produce up to 1.4 million tons per year of finished product. The facility has a 175 ton per hour natural gas fired fluid bed dryer as well as six screeners. 
We have access to a segment of on-site rail track that is tied into a rail line owned by UP, and we use this rail space to stage and store empty or recently loaded customer railcars. Because of the cost efficiencies of shipping frac sand by rail, our location adjacent to a UP short line provides our customers with the ability to transport Northern White frac sand from our New Auburn facility to major oil and natural gas basins currently producing in the United States and western Canada, including access to high-activity areas of oil production in Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado and the western United States. 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, our New Auburn facility produced 0.4 million tons of Northern White sand. We idled the facility periodically during 2016 but resumed consistent production in October 2016, and the plant was operating at high levels to start 2017.
Kosse
Our Kosse dry plant is located adjacent to our Kosse mine and wet plant on land we own in Kosse, Texas. The facility has a rated production capacity of 1,650 tons per day year-round. The dry plant utilizes a 200 ton per hour natural gas fired rotary dryer that is capable of producing up to 600,000 tons per year of dry native Texas frac sand, and has an air permit that allows us to produce up to 1.2 million tons per year of finished product. We introduced new processing techniques at our Kosse plant in 2015 that allowed us to inexpensively extract significant amounts of saleable frac sand from previously mined and discarded waste sand. The plant produces 100-mesh native Texas sand and is capable of producing a higher-cut 40/70 frac sand. We also sell sand to non-energy end users, including industrial applications, and sports sand for golf courses, stadiums and other sports-related venues. The Kosse facility has three on-site 1,000-ton storage silos designed for loading trucks for delivery to local and regional markets.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, our Kosse facility produced approximately 140,000 tons of frac sand. 
Transportation Logistics and Infrastructure
We sell our sand both free-on-board (“FOB”) at our plants as well as at transload facilities that are closer to the wellhead. As the frac sand market has evolved, the point of sale between producers and purchasers of frac sand continues to move away from the FOB plant model and closer to the wellhead. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold approximately 43% of our sand FOB plant and 57% FOB transload. At our Kosse, Texas plant, orders are picked up by truck because most orders are transported 
8

200 miles or less from our plant site. Because nearly all product from our Wisconsin plants is transported in excess of 200 miles and transportation costs typically represent more than 50% of our customers' overall cost for delivered Northern White sand, the majority of our Wisconsin shipments are transported by rail to a transload and storage location in close proximity to the customer's intended end use destination.
While many of our customers continue to purchase FOB plant, we offer our customers a total supply chain solution pursuant to which we manage every aspect of the supply chain from mining and manufacturing to delivery within close proximity to the wellhead. Currently, we have built a fleet of company-leased and customer-committed railcars, assembled a network of leased transload and terminal storage sites located near major shale plays, and designed a supply chain management system all of which allow us to flexibly and efficiently coordinate rail, truck, and storage assets with customer order information. 
Transload Facilities
Due to limited storage capacity at or near the wellhead, our customers generally find it impractical to store frac sand in large quantities immediately near their job sites. We can service manifest rail deliveries or unit train shipments and minimize product fulfillment lead times through the simultaneous handling of multiple customers' railcars. In order to continue to service the customer closer to the wellhead, we have assembled a network of transload facilities within a number of the major basins that we serve. Below is a summary of the transload sites that we operate out of as of December 31, 2016.

Transload Location by Basin | Transload Sites as of December 31, 2016 | Transload Sites Capable of Receiving Unit Trains | | 2016 Volume Sold(Thousands of Tons)
Bakken Shale | 1 | | 1 | | 181 
Barnett Shale | 1 | | — | | 1 
Eagle Ford Shale | 1 | | 1 | | 187 
Haynesville Shale | 1 | | 1 | | 3 
Marcellus / Utica Shales | 1 | | 1 | | 66 
Mid-Continent Basin | 1 | | 1 | | 118 
Permian Basin | 4 | | 2 | | 437 
Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin | 3 | | — | | 188 
Export to South America | 1 | | — | | 6 
Total tons sold through transloads active at December 31, 2016 | 14 | | 7 | | 1,187
Tons sold through transloads not active at December 31, 2016 | | | | 53 
Tons sold through transloads in 2016 | | | | 1,240 

As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 5,573 railcars in our fleet, including 287 railcars that are owned or leased by our customers but dedicated to us, and 5,286 railcars that we lease with a weighted average remaining term of 5.2 years. 
Permits
In order to conduct our sand operations, we are required to obtain permits from various local, state and federal government agencies. The various permits we must obtain address such issues as mining, construction, air quality, water discharge, noise, dust, and reclamation. Prior to receiving these permits, we must comply with the regulatory requirements imposed by the issuing governmental authority. In some cases, we also must have certain plans pre-approved, such as site reclamation plans, prior to obtaining the required permits. A decision by a governmental agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility. Expansion of our existing operations also is predicated upon securing the necessary environmental and other permits and approvals. We have obtained all permits required for the operation of our existing facilities. We will also obtain permits necessary to process and distribute any new product, as might be required.

Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property consists primarily of patents, trade secrets, know-how and products such as “SandMaxX™” and “SandGuard™.” We hold 11 U.S. granted patents that are still in force, the majority of which have an expiration date after 2027. Typically, we utilize trade secrets to protect the formulations and processes we use to manufacture our products and to safeguard our proprietary formulations and methods. We believe we can effectively protect our trade secrets indefinitely through the use of confidentiality agreements and other security measures. 
Fuel Business
The Fuel business consisted of our facilities located in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area and in Birmingham, Alabama, which were operated by Direct Fuels and AEC, respectively. Through this business, we acquired and processed transmix, which is a blend of different refined petroleum products that have become co-mingled in the pipeline transportation process, sold wholesale petroleum products; provided third-party terminaling services, and provided other complementary products and services. In these two markets, we were able to offer our customers gasoline and diesel at market rates, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. On August 31, 2016, we completed the sale of our Fuel business. Therefore, the results of operations of the Fuel business have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. A selected summary of our volumes for the year ended December 31, 2016 follows:

Plant Location | Fuel From Transmix Sold | Wholesale Fuel Volume Sold | | Terminal Throughput Volume
 | (Volumes in thousands of gallons)
Dallas-Fort Worth, TX | 37,213 | | 11,869 | | 45,532
Birmingham, AL | 31,113 | | 85,228 | | 37,321

In our transmix business, we acquired transmix from terminal operators and others, which was delivered by pipeline or truck to our facilities. We then processed the transmix into refined products such as conventional gasoline and low sulfur diesel, which we sold over our truck loading rack to third party distributors as well as off-road customers such as railroad, and marine operators. We structured our transmix purchase agreements to capture a stable margin, as the price differential between the indices at which we purchased transmix supply and the sales price of the corresponding refined product. While our transmix purchase agreements were designed to capture a stable margin at the time of purchase, the final sales price was subject to daily fluctuations in fuel prices, and this holding period risk affected our profitability. We sought to partially mitigate the holding period risk by hedging a portion of our inventories.
In our wholesale fuel business, we purchased fuel that was delivered to our tanks via pipeline, which we then subsequently sold over our truck loading rack. At our Birmingham facility, we received refined fuels on pipelines operated by Plantation Pipeline, and Colonial Pipeline. We had shipper status on the Plantation line, but our space allocation was limited to one cycle per month. At our Dallas-Fort Worth facility, we received refined fuels and transmix on two lines operated by Explorer Pipeline Company, and we were connected to an independent refiner via a private pipeline. Our average holding period for transmix and wholesale gallons was 7-10 days, which served to minimize, but not eliminate, the effects of daily fluctuations in fuel price.
In our terminaling business, we leased our terminal space to third parties who used our facilities to store refined petroleum products. We were able to charge customers for the storage, intake, and/or outtake of refined products. We also had injection additive systems that allowed us to sell branded gasoline.
Other services included blending of renewable fuels into petroleum products, the manufacturing of biodiesel at our Birmingham facility and certain reclamation services, which consisted primarily of tank cleaning services. We were also are a net producer of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, which we sold to reduce our cost of goods sold.
Customers
We sell substantially all of our sand to customers in the oil and gas proppants market. Our customers include major oilfield services companies as well as exploration and production companies that are engaged in hydraulic fracturing. Sales to the oil and gas proppants market comprised approximately 99% of our total Sand business sales in 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our top two customers, EP Energy Corporation and Performance Technologies, LLC, collectively accounted for approximately 51% and 27%, respectively, of our total revenues for continuing operations.
In 2016, total sales to customers under long-term contracts, including take-or-pay, fixed-volume, and efforts-based contracts, accounted for 62% of our total Sand business sales. As of December 31, 2016, we had 6.4 million tons under long-term contract with a weighted average remaining term of four years. 
10

While we continue to actively pursue take-or-pay and fixed-volume contracts as part of our broader strategy, our customers increasingly favor efforts-based contracts over take-or-pay or fixed-volume contracts. As part of the overall value proposition, we also believe customers will be focused on the relative quality of sand, logistics capabilities, and service level offered by their frac sand providers. 
Suppliers and Service Providers
We have engaged Fred Weber to mine and process wet sand at our New Auburn wet plant facility under a contract that expires at the end of 2021, at which time title and operations of the facility will revert to us. Fred Weber has mined and processed wet sand at New Auburn since we commenced operations in 2011. In 2015, the Weber contract was suspended until January 1, 2017. In July 2014, we closed on the acquisition of Midwest, which had been a supplier to us prior to the acquisition. During 2014, we purchased wet sand from other third parties in order to ensure sufficient wet sand for our dry plant operations. We did not purchase any third party wet sand outright in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. In 2016, we selectively purchased raw sand in order to supplement our supply during the winter months, or where there was demand for a particular grade that exceeded our capacity to produce. We will continue to consider such purchases in the future where it helps us better serve customers, and the economics make sense for us financially.
Competition
The frac sand market is a highly competitive market that is comprised of a small number of large, national producers, which we also refer to as “Tier 1” producers, and a larger number of small, regional, or local producers. Competition in the frac sand industry has increased from 2011 to 2014 due to favorable pricing and demand trends, and we expect competition to increase in the future. Suppliers compete based on price, consistency, quality of product, site location, distribution capability, customer service, reliability of supply, breadth of product offering and technical support.
Based on management's internal estimates, we believe we were one of the five largest producers of frac sand in 2016 by production capacity and sales volumes, together with FMSA Holdings, Inc., Hi-Crush Proppants LLC, U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc., and Unimin Corporation. In recent years there has also been an increase in the number of small producers servicing the frac sand market due to increased demand for hydraulic fracturing services and related proppant supplies. Demand trends up until the end of 2014 attracted new frac sand supply which softened pricing for most products in light of recent demand trends in the North American oil and natural gas industry. We believe, however, that the relative inexperience of many management teams operating in the frac sand industry coupled with the costs, length of time and operational challenges associated with identifying attractive frac sand reserves, obtaining necessary permits and regulatory approvals and constructing a sand processing facility will prevent these smaller competitors from prospering in the long-run. Further, the large capital outlay required to develop a national logistics network is a barrier to entry in a regular market environment. We believe that industry consolidation and the exit from the market by less successful competitors will occur in the near-term and should benefit the pricing environment for SSS and the remaining frac sand producers.
Seasonality
At our Sand operations, it is challenging to process raw sand during sub-zero temperatures; therefore, frac sand is typically water-washed only eight months of the year at our Wisconsin operations. This results in a seasonal build-up of inventory as we excavate excess sand to build a stockpile to feed the dry plant during the winter months, causing the average inventory balance to increase from a few weeks in early spring to more than 100 days in early winter. These seasonal variations in inventory balance affect our cash flow. We may also sell frac sand for use in oil and gas basins where severe winter weather conditions may curtail drilling activities, and, as a result, our sales volumes to those areas may be adversely affected. For example, we could experience a decline in both volumes sold and income for the second quarter relative to the first quarter each year due to seasonality of frac sand sales into western Canada because sales volumes are generally lower during April and May due to limited drilling activity resulting from that region's annual thaw.
Insurance
We believe that our insurance coverage is customary for the industries in which we operate and adequate for our business. We periodically review insurance plans to address most, but not all, of the risks against our business. Losses and liabilities not covered by insurance would increase our costs. To address the hazards inherent in our business, we maintain insurance coverage that includes physical damage coverage, third-party general liability insurance, employer's liability, environmental and pollution and other coverage, although coverage for environmental and pollution-related losses is subject to significant limitations.

Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
We are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of worker health, safety and the environment. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. We are often obligated to obtain permits or approvals in our operations from various federal, state and local authorities. These permits and approvals can be denied or delayed, which may cause us to lose potential and current customers, interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue. Moreover, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. Private parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. 
We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. However, we cannot assure that future events, such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions adverse to our operations will not cause us to incur significant costs. The following is a discussion of material environmental and worker health and safety laws that relate to our operations.
Air emissions.    Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, as amended (the “CAA”), and comparable state and local laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air emissions permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Obtaining air emissions permits has the potential to delay the development or continued performance of our operations. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or to address other air emissions-related issues such as, by way of example, the capture of increased amounts of fine sands matter emitted from produced sands. In addition, air permits are required for our frac sand mining operations that result in the emission of regulated air contaminants. These permits incorporate the various control technology requirements that apply to our operations and are subject to extensive review and periodic renewal. Any future changes to existing requirements, non-compliance, or failure to maintain necessary permits or other authorizations could require us to incur substantial costs or suspend or terminate our operations.
On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules that establish new air emission controls and practices for oil and natural gas production wells, including wells that are the subject of hydraulic fracturing operations and natural gas processing operations. The EPA later updated the storage tank standards on August 5, 2013 to phase in emission controls more gradually. In May 2016, the EPA finalized additional regulations to control emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds from the oil and natural gas sector. Compliance with these rules could result in significant costs to our customers, which may have an indirect adverse impact on our business.
There can be no assurance that future requirements compelling the installation of more sophisticated emission control equipment would not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Our Fuel business, which we sold in 2016, was subject to additional regulations under the Clean Air Act and analogous state laws and regulations. For example, facilities that emit volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxides face increasingly stringent regulations, including requirements to install various levels of control technology on sources of pollutants. The petroleum processing sector is subject to stringent and evolving EPA and state regulations that establish standards to reduce emissions of certain listed hazardous air pollutants. In October 2015, the EPA finalized a more stringent ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard, which could result in the adoption of more stringent regulations by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The CAA authorizes the EPA to require modifications in the formulation of the refined transportation fuel products that we manufactured in order to limit the emissions associated with the fuel product’s final use. Further, the CAA requires an increasing percentage of vehicle fuels to come from renewable sources, including biodiesel. Compliance with these and related laws and regulations did not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position.
Climate change.    In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future, although energy legislation and other regulatory initiatives are expected to be proposed that may be relevant to GHG emissions issues. In addition, almost half of the states have begun to address GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control GHG emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations.
Independent of Congress, the EPA has adopted regulations controlling GHG emissions under its existing authority under the CAA. For example, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions in the United States for emissions from specified 
12

large GHG emission sources. The EPA also has adopted rules establishing construction and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources of GHG emissions that are already potential major sources of criteria pollutants .
Although it is not currently possible to predict how any such proposed or future GHG legislation or regulation by Congress, the EPA, the states or multi-state regions will impact our business, any legislation or regulation of GHG emissions that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Further, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 70 countries, including the United States, ratified or otherwise consented to be bound by the agreement. To the extent the United States or any other country implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and gas industry, it could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business.
Water discharge.    The Clean Water Act, as amended (the “CWA”), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into regulated waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. The CWA also requires the development and implementation of spill prevention, control and countermeasures, including the construction and maintenance of containment berms and similar structures, if required, to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak at such facilities. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
Safe Drinking Water Act.   Although we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, our customers purchase our frac sand for use in their hydraulic fracturing operations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate gas production. Legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act (the “SDWA”) to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process have been proposed in recent sessions of Congress. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will ever be enacted and, if so, what its provisions would be. Scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways, with the EPA having released a final report regarding the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in 2016. The report concluded that certain activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy released a series of recommendations for improving the safety of the process in 2011. Further, the EPA and the U.S. Department of the Interior (the “DOI”) have adopted new regulations for certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA finalized effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing. The DOI adopted rules that require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing activities upon federal and Indian lands and also would strengthen standards for well-bore integrity and the management of fluids that return to the surface during and after fracturing operations on federal and Indian lands (although implementation of this rule has been stayed pending the resolution of legal challenges). At the state level, some states, including Texas, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. If additional levels of regulation and permits were required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level, that could lead to delays, increased operating costs and process prohibitions that could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in shale formations, increasing our customers' costs of compliance and doing business and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our frac sand products. In addition, heightened political, regulatory and public scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices could potentially expose us or our customers to increased legal and regulatory proceedings, and any such proceedings could be time-consuming, costly or result in substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, whether directly or indirectly. For example, we could be directly affected by adverse litigation involving us, or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance limits the ability of our customers to operate in the geographic areas we serve.
Solid waste.    The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (the “RCRA”), and comparable state laws control the generation, storage, treatment, transfer and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for these types of wastes. In the course of our operations, we generate waste that may be regulated as non-hazardous wastes or even hazardous wastes, obligating us to comply with applicable RCRA standards relating to the management and disposal of such wastes.
13

Site remediation.    The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”), and comparable state laws impose strict, joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of a disposal site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of remediating the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. On November 21, 2013, the EPA issued a General Notice Letter and Information Request (“Notice”) under Section 104(e) of CERCLA to one of our former subsidiaries. The Notice provides that the subsidiary may have incurred liability with respect to the Reef Environmental site in Alabama, and requested certain information in accordance with Section 107(a) of CERCLA. At this time, no specific claim for cost recovery has been made by the EPA (or any other potentially responsible party) against the Partnership. There is uncertainty relating to our share of environmental remediation liability, if any, because our allocable share of wastewater is unknown and the total remediation cost is also unknown. Consequently, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any. We have not recorded a loss contingency accrual in our financial statements. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.
The soil and groundwater associated with and adjacent to our former Dallas-Fort Worth terminal property have been affected by prior releases of petroleum products or other contaminants. A past owner and operator of the terminal property, ConocoPhillips, has been working with TCEQ to address this contamination. We, ConocoPhillips and owners and operators of adjacent industrial properties undertaking unrelated remediation obtained a Municipal Setting Designation (“MSD”) from the City of Fort Worth, which is an ordinance prohibiting the use of groundwater as drinking water in the area of our former terminal property. Following the certification of this MSD by the TCEQ, ConocoPhillips obtained approval of a remedial action plan for the property, which now only requires recordation of a restrictive covenant to comply with the TCEQ requirements. In connection with the sale of this facility, we have agreed to hold our successor harmless from any claims arising from this contamination, none of which has been asserted to our knowledge. We do not believe this former facility is likely to present any material liability to us.
Endangered Species.    The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. The designation of certain species has not caused us to incur material costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans or limit future development activity in the affected areas. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on September 9, 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to consider listing more than 250 species as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Under the September 9, 2011 settlement, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to review and address the needs of more than 250 species on the candidate list before the completion of the agency's 2017 fiscal year. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where our exploration and production customers operate could cause us or our customers to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures and could result in delays or limitations in our customers' performance of operations, which could reduce demand for our services.
Mining and Workplace Safety.    Our sand mining operations are subject to mining safety regulation. The U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) is the primary regulatory organization governing the frac sand industry. Accordingly, MSHA regulates quarries, surface mines, underground mines and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with quarries and mines. The mission of MSHA is to administer the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and to enforce compliance with mandatory worker safety and health standards. MSHA works closely with the Industrial Minerals Association, a trade association in which we have a significant leadership role, in pursuing this mission. As part of MSHA's oversight, representatives perform at least two unannounced inspections annually for each aboveground facility. To date these inspections have not resulted in any citations for material violations of MSHA standards.
We also are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. OSHA regulates the customers and users of frac sand and provides detailed regulations requiring employers to protect employees from overexposure to silica through the enforcement of permissible exposure limits and the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard.

We are not aware of any proposals for significant increased scrutiny on the part of state or local regulators in the jurisdictions in which we operate or community concerns with respect to our operations that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations going forward.
