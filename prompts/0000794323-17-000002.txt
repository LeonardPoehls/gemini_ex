ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Introduction
We are an international facilities-based provider of a broad range of integrated communications services. A facilities-based provider is a provider that owns or leases a substantial portion of the plant, property and equipment necessary to provide its services. We have created our international communications network by constructing our own assets and through a combination of purchasing other companies and purchasing or leasing facilities from others. We designed our network to provide communications services that employ and take advantage of rapidly improving underlying optical, Internet Protocol, computing and storage technologies.
On October 31, 2016, we and CenturyLink, Inc., a Louisiana corporation (“CenturyLink”), entered into a Merger Agreement pursuant to which Wildcat Merger Sub 1 LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of CenturyLink, will merge with and into Level 3 (the “Initial Merger”) with Level 3 continuing as the surviving 
 4

corporation and, immediately following the Initial Merger, the surviving corporation will merge with and into WWG Merger Sub LLC, another wholly owned subsidiary of CenturyLink, with WWG Merger Sub LLC continuing as the surviving company (together with the Initial Merger, the “CenturyLink Acquisition”). The combined company will have the ability to offer CenturyLink’s larger enterprise customer base the benefits of our global footprint with a combined presence in more than 60 countries. In addition, the combined company will be positioned to further enhance the scope and transmission speeds of its broadband infrastructure. 
If the CenturyLink Acquisition is completed, our stockholders will have the right to receive $26.50 in cash and 1.4286 shares of CenturyLink common stock for each share of Level 3 common stock they own at the effective time of the Initial Merger (the “exchange ratio”), with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the closing of the combination. Based on the closing price of CenturyLink common stock on the New York Stock Exchange of $28.25 on October 26, 2016, the last trading day before public reports of a possible transaction, the merger consideration represented approximately $66.86 of aggregate value for each share of Level 3 common stock. 
The descriptions of our business in this Form 10-K do not assume that the CenturyLink Acquisition has been completed. However we do describe certain risk factors associated with the pending transaction below under Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Our company was incorporated as Peter Kiewit Sons’, Inc. in Delaware in 1941 to continue a construction business founded in Omaha, Nebraska in 1884. In subsequent years, we invested a portion of the cash flow generated by our construction activities in a variety of other businesses, including, among other things, the communications business. In 1998, our historical construction business was split off from the remainder of our operations. In conjunction with the split-off, we changed our name to “Level 3 Communications, Inc.,” and the entity that was split-off and held the prior construction business was named “Peter Kiewit Sons’, Inc.”
We sold various businesses subsequent to the split-off, including our coal mining business in November 2011, as part of our long-term strategy to focus on core communications business operations. Most recently, in October 2011, we acquired Global Crossing Limited and in October 2014 we acquired tw telecom inc. The results of operations of the companies that we have acquired have been included in our consolidated results of operations since the respective closing date of the acquisition.
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 12,600 total employees. We believe that our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.
We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. These filings are available to the public on the Internet at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. You may also read and copy any document we file with the SEC at the SEC’s public reference room, located at 100 F Street, N.E. Room 1580, Washington, D.C. 20549. Our Form 10-K and all other reports and amendments filed with or furnished to the SEC are publicly available free of charge on the investor relations section of our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such materials with, or furnish them to, the SEC. Our website is www.level3.com. We caution you that the information on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC.

Business Overview, Vision and Strategy
Level 3’s vision is to be the trusted connection to the networked world. We seek to achieve this vision by focusing on:

• | maximizing the value of our network for our customers by expanding the breadth and depth of our local to global network, and connecting our customers to their digital ecosystem of data and applications, which we refer to as “digital transformation;”


• | delivering an exceptional and consistent customer experience by innovating to improve the efficiency and scalability of our operating platform; and


• | generating profitable growth by expanding our enterprise customer base and layering value-added services onto existing network and operational capabilities.

We strive to create a culture and business environment that makes it easy for customers to do business with us, and providing high-performing, reliable and secure services on our local-to-global network with superior price value. We focus on operational excellence to streamline our systems and business processes to deliver a superior customer experience, and to reduce overhead costs and transactional costs for ourselves and for our customers.
We believe that we can be successful by making our customers the focal point of all we do. Our value proposition is structured to be fully aligned with helping our customers meet their growth, efficiency and security business challenges both today and in the future and across the globe wherever our services are available.
We believe that advances in optical and Internet Protocol, or IP, technologies have facilitated, and will continue to facilitate, decreases in unit costs for communications service providers that are able to most effectively take advantage of these technology advances. We believe that, over time, rapidly improving technologies and high demand elasticity will continue to drive this market dynamic.
Enterprises are increasingly moving their content and applications to third party providers of on-demand server and storage resources to reduce the costs and complexity of their information technology, or IT, operations. Since these server and storage resources can be offsite in any location and are often virtualized (as opposed to residing on dedicated hardware in a known location) they are referred to as “Cloud Services.” We believe that this migration of enterprise data and applications to the Cloud will drive increased demand for our high-performing, reliable and secure network services.
Today’s market drivers can be broken into three categories as they pertain to our core business strategy:

• | Growth. We expect digital data creation and the associated demand for bandwidth to keep growing, as business relationships and supply chains become increasingly digital, and end users increasingly expect to be able to access their data and applications anytime and anywhere. Cloud application adoption continues to grow for all businesses, especially our enterprise customers. Mobility and Internet connected device proliferation continue to increase the rate at which content - especially video - is consumed, which in turn results in increased demand for higher bandwidth to enable that delivery and consumption. A rapidly increasing number of smart homes, cars, and everyday objects are getting connected to the network (the “Internet of Things”), further increasing demand for scalable and secure bandwidth. Globalization trends continue as customers look for growth from emerging markets, particularly with respect to enterprise customers. Additional opportunities for growth are present as a result of changing regulatory requirements in industries such as healthcare, consumer privacy, and financial services.

• | Efficiency. As traffic volumes grow, our customers are not only under pressure to keep up with this growth but also to do so more efficiently. Accordingly, our product and technology teams take advantage of the scale and capabilities of our network and continuously innovate to deliver cost-effective services that meet customer needs.


• | Security. Cyber threats continue to escalate, which affects both us and our customers. As more enterprise customer data and applications move to the Cloud, and as more and more consumer devices and personal information become reachable through the Internet, maintaining a secure network and collection of systems and processes is more important than ever.

Technology innovation in Internet Protocol and optical networking technologies has resulted in improvement in the functionality of applications supported by these technologies. We believe that this rapid innovation will continue well into the future across a number of different aspects of the communications marketplace.
We believe that decreases in communications services costs and prices enable the development of new bandwidth intensive applications, which, over time, result in even more significant increases in bandwidth demand. In addition, we believe that communications services are direct substitutes for other existing modes of information distribution from sources such as traditional broadcast entertainment as well as distribution of software, audio and video content using physical media delivered through physical transportation systems. An example of this dynamic is the use of the Internet for the distribution of video. We believe that as communications services improve more rapidly than traditional content distribution systems, demand for Internet delivered video will continue to grow rapidly. We also believe that high elasticity of demand for both new applications and the substitution for existing distribution systems will continue for the foreseeable future.
We also believe that there are significant implications that result from these market dynamics. First, given the improvement in optical and Internet Protocol technologies, communications service providers that are most effective at rapidly deploying new services that take advantage of these technologies will have an inherent cost and service advantage over companies that are less effective at deploying new services that use these technologies. In addition, given the consolidation in the number of local access providers (that is, the providers of connections from intercity networks to traffic aggregation points or end user locations), communications service providers that have ownership of local and/or metropolitan network facilities will have an inherent cost and service advantage over companies that do not have ownership over these types of assets. With respect to the migration to Cloud Services, this market dynamic creates opportunities for us to provide secure and high performance network connections to our enterprise customers, enabling their employees to connect seamlessly and efficiently to their content and applications in the Cloud.
In view of these market and technology opportunities, we seek to serve business customers by using a customer-first focus and providing a broad range of communications services over our advanced and extensive fiber optic network. With our network’s extensive geographic reach and deep reach into major metropolitan areas of the United States, Europe and Latin America, we are positioned to provide end-to-end services for business customers entirely on our own facilities across multiple continents.
We have and will continually expand our fiber optic network to new locations where the demands of our customers and potential customers justify the upfront costs of expansion. This allows us to provide an end-to-end connection for the customer across our own fiber optic network, which is more secure and efficient and allows us to deliver a superior customer experience. Today and for the foreseeable future, we will need to connect to some locations using the networks of other carriers. We manage these relationships with other carriers to make the interconnection as efficient and effective as possible. We seek to minimize the need for these “off network” connections by targeting customers whose needs can 
 7

be met primarily over our network and by building our network to as many high-traffic locations as possible.
Our fiber optic network has extensive reach across North America, Europe and Latin America. Our network reaches not only hundreds of cities (we refer to the part of our network connecting the larger cities as our “intercity” network) but also includes fiber optic routes around the various parts of the larger metropolitan areas (we refer to this part of our network as our “metropolitan” or “metro” networks), which allows us to connect directly with wholesale customers in major traffic aggregation centers (such as central offices of local exchange carriers) and with many medium and large enterprise customers at their offices and data centers. In addition, the fact that our metro networks have significant reach throughout major metropolitan areas means that we can make relatively short network extensions to reach customer locations that our network does not currently reach.
To connect our networks in North America, Europe and Latin America, as well as to connect our network to cities in other parts of the world, we own several undersea cables and have purchased capacity on cables owned by others. Since subsea cables require very large upfront investment and have very large capacity compared to the needs of any one carrier, they typically are either owned by consortia of carriers or are financed significantly by selling a large amount of capacity to other carriers either before the cable is built or shortly thereafter. We historically have been active both in building undersea cables and in buying capacity from others. Today we own more than 37,500 route miles of undersea fiber optic cables around the world. In addition, as we have points of presence (PoPs) in Asia, Africa and Australia, we have also purchased capacity on others’ undersea cables to allow us to offer services in those regions despite the fact that we do not have extensive fiber optic networks of our own in these regions. This is important to our ability to handle the global needs of our multinational customers. For more information about our network, see Item 1, “Business - Our Communication Network” below.
For larger customers, specialized real estate is often required to house the equipment that we and the customer use to exchange traffic. This space requires a concentrated amount of electric power and cooling, as well as server racks, fiber optic cables and other technical equipment. Such specialized real estate, depending upon its nature and the type of companies that use it, is referred to variously as “colocation” or “data center” space. For interconnection among wholesale carriers and some of the largest enterprise customers, we also use real estate owned by third parties. We own or lease more than 250 colocation facilities in North America, approximately 100 colocation facilities in Europe, and approximately 15 colocation facilities in Latin America. In addition, we operate approximately 20 data center facilities in Latin America, Europe and North America.
Our business includes voice services. Historically, end-user voice services were provided over a network of local exchange carriers whose copper wire networks were dedicated to that service. Today, voice services can be carried over the Internet as a data service. This type of voice service usually is referred to as “voice over Internet Protocol,” or “VoIP”. Since many calls include a connection to the traditional voice network on one end and a VoIP connection on the other, early in our existence we became deeply involved in managing connections between VoIP customers and those on the traditional public switched telephone network. This involves not only developing and managing equipment and software specialized for that purpose but also developing physical connections of our Internet Protocol network with the traditional networks of the various local exchange carriers. Additionally, we have also physically interconnected our IP network with the networks of many cellular telephone carriers. This enables us to provide what we believe is a more comprehensive service than most other carriers can provide to handle customers’ needs for voice connections in today’s changing communications environment. Our services that manage the initiation or termination of customers’ voice calls generally are referred to as “local voice” services. Our voice services also include our comprehensive suite of audio, web and video collaboration services.
We also provide services that handle the termination of large volumes of telephone calls on behalf of other carriers. We refer to these as “wholesale voice” services. These services are provided in a 
 8

very competitive environment in which many carriers participate and the customer typically uses automated systems to choose the least expensive way to terminate traffic to each city around the world on a minute-by-minute basis. 
We provide specialized communications services for companies that distribute video or other digitized content across the Internet. Because the amount of bandwidth required by such media is large, special services are used to ensure delivery of such content at desired levels of quality. We have developed a system of servers, with software to control them, that store more popular content in various locations around the world. The aim is to store content so that it is not transferred very far across the Internet. This type of service typically is referred to as a “Content Delivery Network,” or “CDN.” We also have specialized video services to handle the needs of broadcasters for the rapid transmission of the very large streams of information that emerge when live events are broadcast. We carry these video streams across our network to locations specified by the broadcasters and from which these customers broadcast their final edited content.
Managing the transmission of information across our network requires the proper management of many interconnected technologies, processes and systems to provide high quality, convenient secure and reliable services for our customers. Some of these services may be charged for separately, while others are included as an integral part of our more basic services. Examples of services that are typically charged separately include network security (i.e., helping customers keep their information safe) and network monitoring (i.e., keeping customers informed of the status of various equipment and sub-parts of their connections). We regularly develop new features and ancillary services to keep our network services as valuable as possible to our target customers.
Since a large portion of our communications services are purchased by companies to interconnect their own information technology applications, often we find that certain customers need ancillary services that are not clearly part of communications network services and may more properly be described as information technology services. In an effort to ensure that our customers receive a superior overall experience, we frequently enter into partnerships with providers that specialize in these information technology services, so that we can assemble the full collection of services for the customer. In making the decision to add such services, we consider several factors including our core strengths, the existence of other parties with whom we can work to satisfy the customers’ needs, how important it is to customers that the new service be combined into a single Level 3 offering, and the size of the incremental market that would become addressable by offering such services. For more information about our service offerings, see Item 1, “Business - Our Service Offerings” below.
We are currently focusing our attention on a number of operational and financial objectives, including:

• | driving profitable revenue growth by increasing sales generated by our Core Network Services;


• | growing our Enterprise customer base as well as our share of their telecom spend, as this customer group has the largest potential for significant growth;


• | continually improving the customer experience to increase customer retention and reduce customer churn;


• | launching new products and services to meet customer needs, in particular for Enterprise customers;


• | reducing network costs and operating expenses relative to our revenue;


• | growing positive cash flows from operations;

 9


• | continuing to show improvement in Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in Item 7, “Management’s Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation”) as a percentage of revenue;


• | concentrating our capital expenditures on those technologies and assets that enable us to increase our Core Network Services revenue;


• | integrating our prior acquisitions, building on the strengths and capabilities of the acquired legacy companies to position the combined company as a premier global communications provider; and


• | managing our Wholesale Voice Services for margin contribution.

For a discussion of our Core Network Services and Wholesale Voice Services, see Item 1, “Business-Our Service Offerings” below.
Our Strengths
We believe that the following strengths will assist us in implementing our strategy:

• | Experienced Management Team. We have assembled a management team that we believe is well suited for our business objectives and strategy. Our senior management has substantial experience in leading the development, marketing and sale of communications services and in managing, designing and constructing metropolitan, intercity and international networks.


• | Recognized Industry Leadership. We have a proven track record among communication service providers for being the first to implement many new technologies, including: global MPLS network in 2001, first global provider with IPV6 natively deployed, first to introduce VoIP and MPLS, and the first converged IP solution.


• | Global Reach of Our Network. We deliver services to more than 60 countries around the world on our global network. Our network connects and crosses North America, Latin America, Europe and a portion of the Asia/Pacific region.


• | A Broad Range of Communications Services. We provide a broad range of communications services designed to meet the needs of our customers over our network. Our communications service offerings include:


• | Internet and data services, which includes Internet access and IP and Ethernet Virtual Private Networks, content distribution services including caching and downloading, streaming as well as video broadcast services;


• | Transport and fiber services, which includes services such as wavelengths and private line services (transoceanic, backhaul, intercity, metro and unprotected private line services) as well as dark fiber in both our intercity and metropolitan networks;


• | Voice and collaboration services, which includes enterprise or business voice services, wholesale VoIP component services, wholesale voice origination and termination services, voice, web and video conferencing and collaboration services; and


• | Colocation and data center services, which offer high quality data center space where customers can locate servers, content storage devices and communications network equipment in a safe and secure technical operating environment along with value-added

 10

services such as Managed Network Services and Managed Security, including protection against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
The availability of these services varies by location.
For several years we have been developing services that take advantage of the investment that we have made in our network and that generally target large, existing markets. We have also expanded our existing markets for communications services through the acquisitions that we have completed, which has significantly increased the global reach of our network. Through our efforts we have increased significantly our addressable market by adding new addressable customers as well as new voice and data services that take advantage of the geographic coverage and cost advantages of our network.

• | Significant Metropolitan Network Platform. As of December 31, 2016, we have metropolitan fiber networks in approximately 350 markets in North America, Europe and Latin America, which currently contain approximately 69,000 route miles. The number of route miles may change in the future as we continue to optimize our network routes. Our metropolitan networks enable us to connect directly to points of traffic aggregation and customer locations and reduce our costs for the termination of our customers’ communications traffic on other carriers’ networks. 


• | End-to-End Network Platform. Our strategy is to deploy network infrastructure in major metropolitan areas and to link these networks with significant intercity and trans-oceanic networks in North America, Europe and Latin America. We believe that the integration of our metropolitan and intercity networks with our colocation facilities will expand the scope and reach of our on-net customer coverage, facilitate the uniform deployment of technological innovations as we manage our future upgrade paths and allow us to grow or scale our service offerings rapidly. We believe that we have a unique combination of:


• | a substantial intercity and subsea network;


• | large fiber count metropolitan networks;


• | global network reach;


• | substantial colocation & data center facilities;


• | innovative content distribution technology and services; and


• | a growing set of security services.


• | Advanced IP Backbone. We operate one of the largest international IP networks or backbones. Our IP services deliver a broad range of IP transit and network interconnection solutions tailored to meet the varied needs of high bandwidth users.


• | Extensive Patent Portfolio. Our patent portfolio includes patents covering technologies ranging from data and voice services, to content distribution, to transmission and networking equipment. We utilize our patent portfolio in multiple ways. Developing or acquiring technologies and receiving the legal right to preclude others from using them may give us a competitive advantage. The breadth and depth of our patent portfolio may deter others, particularly telecommunications operators, from bringing patent infringement claims against us for fear of counter-claim by us and enhances our ability to enter into cross-licensing arrangements with other patent holders. We will continue to file new patent applications as we enhance and develop products and services, we will continue to seek opportunities to

 11

expand our patent portfolio through strategic acquisitions and licensing, and we will continue to appropriately enforce our patents against infringement by others.

• | A More Readily Upgradeable Network Infrastructure. We generally endeavor to design new networks to take advantage of technological innovations, incorporating many of the features that are not present in older communications networks. We design the transmission network to optimize aspects of fiber and optronics simultaneously as a system to provide an efficient cost structure for the services that we deliver to our customers. As fiber and optical transmission technology changes, we expect to realize new unit cost improvements by deploying more cost efficient technologies in our network. We believe that our network, process and system design will enable us to provide competitive services to our customers while also lowering our costs to provide those services.

Our data center facilities offer high quality, data center space where customers can locate servers, content storage devices and communications network equipment in a safe and secure technical operating environment. In addition, we offer high-speed, reliable connectivity to our network and to other networks, including metro and intercity networks, the traditional public switched telephone network and the Internet. Our data center services range from dedicated hosting and cloud services to more complex managed solutions, including disaster recovery, business continuity, applications management support, and security services to manage mission critical applications.


• | Security Services. Also reported in this category, Level 3 Network-Based Security Solutions use our expansive view of the threat landscape to enable customers to address the escalating risk of cyber-attacks. The solutions allow customers to create a secure network, safeguard brand value, enable business continuity, and avoid complexity and cost. Our Security Services include: Adaptive Network Security, a fully managed and maintained cloud-based network security option to protect all layers of the enterprise including intrusion protection, data loss protection and Web content filtering; Adaptive Threat Intelligence, which provides actionable threat intelligence for a customer’s network, automatically identifying and prioritizing risks in a tailored portal or integrated into a customer security information and event management, or SIEM; network-based Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Mitigation, which protects against internet-based DDoS attacks; and Professional Security Services for governance, risk management, and compliance. Security Services are sold stand-alone or in conjunction with Data Services.

Wholesale Voice Services. Our Wholesale Voice Services include voice termination and toll free service. These services share many of the same features as the local and enterprise voice services described above.

• | Voice Termination. Our wholesale long distance offer include domestic and international voice termination services targeted to IXCs, wireless providers, local phone companies, cable companies, resellers and voice over IP providers.


• | Toll Free. As with Enterprise Toll Free, Level 3’s wholesale Toll Free service terminates toll free calls that are originated on the traditional telephone network. Customers for these services include call centers, conferencing providers, and voice over IP providers.

Our priority remains to protect the confidentiality of our customers’ data, and to protect and secure our network. In addition, it is our policy and our practice to comply with laws in every country where we operate, and to provide government agencies access to customer data only when we are compelled to do so by the laws in the country where the data is located. We will continue to operate our global network in this manner to comply with applicable laws and the regulatory requirements of the telecommunications industry.

To implement our strategy and reach our target large, multinational enterprise customers, we have a Global Account Management team, which operates across our regions. In North America we also 
 17

have a General Manager sales model to target enterprises that are not Global Account Management accounts and government customers, where sales leaders manage sales, sales support, marketing, service delivery, service assurance, network planning and financial personnel. In North America, we also use an inside or call center based sales force, and indirect sales channels of third-party agents to reach our target customers.
In EMEA and Latin America, our sales teams use a combination of a direct sales force, an inside or call center based sales force, and indirect sales channels of third-party agents. 
The specific elements that we use to reach our target customers depend upon the nature of the customers that are being targeted.
Our sales functions are supported by dedicated employees in sales and customer target marketing. These sales functions are also supported by centralized service or product management and development, general or corporate marketing, network services, engineering, information technology, and corporate functions including legal, finance, strategy and human resources.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top ten communications customers represented approximately 16% of our total revenue.
For a discussion of certain geographic information regarding how we manage our business, please see the discussion under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” appearing later in this Form 10-K.
Our Communications Network
Our network is an advanced, international, facilities based communications network. We primarily provide services over our own facilities. As of December 31, 2016, our network encompasses:

• | approximately 106,000 intercity route miles in North America, Europe and Latin America;


• | metropolitan fiber networks in approximately 350 markets containing approximately 69,000 route miles;


• | approximately eight million square feet of Gateway and transmission facilities in North America, Europe and Latin America;


• | more than 360 colocation and data center facilities globally;


• | approximately 37,500 route miles of subsea optical fiber cable systems; and


• | more than 60 countries in service around the world.

Terrestrial Intercity Networks. Our intercity network covers approximately 70,000 route miles in North America, 26,000 route miles in Europe, and 10,000 route miles in Latin America as of December 31, 2016. We may eliminate specific routes or duplicate routes as we continue to look at opportunities to optimize our cost structure and remove unnecessary cost. Our intercity network generally includes the following characteristics:
Optical fiber strands designed to accommodate Dense Wave Division Multiplexing, or DWDM, transmission technology. Our optical fiber strands are designed to accommodate DWDM technology. We believe that the installation of newer optical fibers will allow a combination of greater wavelengths of light per strand, higher transmission speeds and longer physical spacing between network electronics. We 
 18

also believe that each new generation of optical fiber will allow increases in the performance of these network design aspects and will therefore enable lower unit costs.
High speed intercity DWDM equipment. Our high speed intercity DWDM equipment provides high quality, reliable and cost effective transmission across our fiber backbone. We are continually evaluating advancements in technology that will enable us to scale, lower our cost and provide higher speed services over our intercity network. We believe that the market will continue to move toward Ethernet based services and higher speed interfaces. Through our technology evaluations we believe that we have positioned ourselves to be able to deliver these capabilities for both our own IP network needs as well as those of our customers.
Open, non-proprietary hardware and software interfaces. Our intercity network is designed to maximize the use of open, non-proprietary hardware and software interfaces to allow less costly upgrades as hardware and software technology improves.
Local Market Infrastructure. Our local facilities include fiber optic metropolitan networks connecting our intercity network and Gateways to buildings housing communications intensive end users, enterprise customers and traffic aggregation points-including ILEC and CLEC central offices, long distance carrier points-of-presence or POPs, cable head-ends, wireless providers’ facilities and Internet peering and transit facilities. Our high fiber count metropolitan networks allow us to extend our services directly to our customers’ locations at low costs, because the availability of this network infrastructure does not require extensive multiplexing equipment to reach a customer location, which is required in ordinary fiber constrained metropolitan networks. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 59,000, 3,200 and 6,800 route miles of metropolitan fiber networks in North America, Europe and Latin America, respectively, and had operational, facilities based, local metropolitan networks in 229, 59, 52 and 2 markets in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia, respectively. We may eliminate specific and/or duplicate routes as we continue to look at opportunities to reduce and/or optimize our network cost structure.
We operate approximately eight million square feet of space for our Gateway and transmission facilities. Our initial Gateway facilities were designed to house local sales staff, operational staff, our transmission and Internet Protocol routing, Content Delivery Networks and voice switching facilities and technical space to accommodate colocation services that is, the colocation of equipment by high-volume Level 3 customers, in an environmentally controlled, secure site with direct access to Level 3’s network generally through dual, fault tolerant connections. As of December 31, 2016, we had more than 250 colocation facilities in North America, approximately 90 colocation facilities in Europe, and approximately 15 colocation facilities in Latin America.
Most of these facilities offer a complete set of data center services ranging from housing and hosting, to more complex managed solutions, including disaster recovery, applications management, business continuity, and security services to manage mission critical applications.
Transoceanic Networks. We own a number of subsea fiber optic cable systems, including Atlantic Crossing-1 (“AC-1”), Atlantic Crossing-2 (“AC-2”), Mid-Atlantic Crossing (“MAC”), South American Crossing (“SAC”), Pan American Crossing (“PAC”) and an approximately 300 route mile system connecting the U.K. and Ireland. AC-1 and AC-2 link our European network to our North American intercity network and each of AC-1 and Yellow (AC-2) consists of four fiber strand pairs. MAC provides a strategic gateway between the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S. and our Latin America assets, a route that is experiencing acute demand growth. SAC connects major markets throughout Latin America and is one of only two sub-sea systems currently in operation that circumnavigates the majority of South America including an extension into Colombia. PAC is integrated with a 2,300 mile terrestrial ring route (including associated backhaul) within Mexico, as well as an extension to Costa Rica.
 19

We also own capacity in the TAT-14 transatlantic cable system. In 2016 we purchased and lit a fiber pair on the Apollo South cable system. We also are an owner of the Japan-US cable system, (were an owner on the China-US cable system which retired in December 2016), an indefeasible right of use, or IRU, holder on the Southern Cross cable system extending from Australia to California, as well as an owner of the Americas II cable extending from Florida to Brazil, and an IRU holder on the Arcos system in the Caribbean. We also own a share in the Hawaiian Inter Island Fiber Network (HIFN). In addition, we own capacity on the Global Cloud Exchange transatlantic system Flag Atlantic-1 and capacity on the Hibernia transatlantic cable system and also the Apollo North cable system.
Content Acquisition and Distribution Services Architecture. Content distribution network, or CDN, describes a system of computers networked together across the Internet to provide content to users in the most efficient manner to enable an optimal user experience. In a CDN, nodes or groups of computers are deployed in multiple locations closer to the end user, also known as the “edge of the network” and cooperate with each other to satisfy requests for content by end users, transparently moving content behind the scenes to optimize the delivery process. Requests for content are directed intelligently through sophisticated software applications to nodes that provide optimal performance for end users.
The CDN platform directs network traffic across our existing physical network and infrastructure. The CDN platform is composed of the edge server or computer that provides caching and streaming functions, and the global server that provides load balancing-that is, a computer that directs the traffic to the most efficient edge server to meet the end user’s request. The edge server enables the storage of popular content in a location that is closer to the end user and thereby reduces bandwidth requirements and improves response times for that stored content. 
The Vyvx platform transmits audio and video programming for our customers over our fiber optic network and via satellite. We use our network to carry many live traditional broadcast and cable television events from the site of the event to the network control centers of the broadcasters of the event. 
Our Patent Portfolio
Through acquisitions and through our own research and development, as of December 31, 2016, we have more than 1,400 patents and patent applications in the United States and around the world. Our patent portfolio includes patents covering technologies ranging from data and voice services to content distribution to transmission and networking equipment.
In addition to the patents and patent applications we own, we have received licenses to patents held by others, including through a cross-license agreement with IBM entered into in December 2007, giving us access to technology covered by IBM’s approximately (at that time) 42,000 patents covering many technologies relevant to our business. While patents give us the right to prevent others, particularly competitors, from using our proprietary technologies, patent licenses give us the freedom to operate our business without the risk of interruption from the holder of the patent that has been licensed to us.
We use our patent portfolio in a number of ways. First, developing or acquiring technologies and receiving the legal right to preclude others from using them may give us a competitive advantage. Second, the breadth and depth of our patent portfolio may deter others, particularly telecommunications operators, from bringing patent infringement claims against us for fear of counter-claim by us. Most of the patent infringement suits brought against us to date have been initiated by patent-holding companies who do not operate telecommunications businesses and who are less likely to be subject to a counter-claim of infringement by us. Finally, the extensiveness of our patent portfolio gives us the option to cross-license with others having similarly broad portfolios on terms acceptable to us, mitigating the risk that others will wish to assert patent infringement claims against us.
We will continue to file new patent applications as we enhance and develop products and services, we will continue to seek opportunities to expand our patent portfolio through strategic 
 20

acquisitions and licensing and we will continue to appropriately enforce our patents against infringement by others.
Business Support Systems
We believe that it is important to streamline and simplify our processes and systems. To pursue our business strategies, we have developed and are continuing to develop and implement a set of integrated software applications designed to automate our operational processes. These development activities also relate to the integration of the systems that were used by the companies that we have acquired. Through the development of our business support systems, we believe that we have the opportunity to obtain a competitive advantage relative to traditional telecommunications companies. In addition, we recognize that for the success of certain of our services that some of our business support systems will need to be easily accessible and usable directly by our customers.
We are currently developing and deploying a unified set of simplified processes and systems that have been designed to streamline and synchronize our service, sales and operational functions. These processes and systems have been designed to provide improved capability in service catalog management, sales opportunity management, customer management, quoting, order entry, order workflow, physical and logical network inventory management, service management, and financial management.
Key design aspects of the business support system development program are:

• | integrated modular applications to allow us to upgrade specific applications as new services are available;


• | a scalable architecture that allows our customers and third-party sales channel partners direct access to certain functions that would otherwise have to be performed by our employees;


• | phased completion of software releases designed to allow us to test functionality on an incremental basis;


• | “web-enabled” applications so that on-line access to order entry, network operations, billing, and customer care functions are available to all authorized users, including our customers;


• | use of a service-oriented architecture that is designed to separate data and applications, and is expected to allow reuse of software capabilities at minimum cost;


• | use of pre-developed, commercial “off-the-shelf” applications or Software as a Service (SaaS), where applicable, which will interface with our internally developed applications; and


• | creation of a mobility solution for use by sales and certain operational functions to improve productivity and customer experience.

Competition
The communications industry has been and remains highly competitive. In the late 1990s and the early 2000s, significant new capacity was deployed by both existing and new entrants. This oversupply led to a period of financial restructuring and industry consolidation. Given the significant economies of scale inherent in the communications industry, we believe further consolidation will occur such as CenturyLink’s acquisition of us and Verizon’s recently completed acquisition of XO.
 21

Our primary competitors are long distance carriers, ILECs, CLECs, Post Telephone and Telegraphs, or PTTs, companies that operate Content Delivery Networks, or CDNs, and other companies such as cable companies, that provide communications services. The following information identifies some key competitors for each of our service offerings.
Our key competitors for our IP and data services include Verizon, AT&T, NTT, Tata and Cogent in North America, and BT, Orange, TeliaSonera and Tata in Europe. In Latin America, our main competitors are Telefonica, Telmex and national incumbent telecommunications carriers.
For transport and fiber services, our key competitors in North America are other facilities based communications companies including AT&T, Verizon, CenturyLink, and Zayo. In Europe, our key competitors are other carriers such as PTT companies, BT, Orange, Vodafone, TeliaSonera, Colt, Interoute, KPN, Belgacom and Zayo. In Latin America, our main competitors are Telefonica, Telmex and national incumbent telecommunications carriers.
For voice services our key competitors are other providers of communications services including AT&T, Verizon, CenturyLink, CLECs and national incumbent telecommunications carriers.
For our colocation and datacenter services, our key competitors are other facilities based communications companies, and other colocation providers such as web hosting companies and third-party colocation companies. In North America, these companies include Equinix, Terremark (Verizon), and CoreSite. In Europe, competitors include Equinix, Global Switch, InterXion, and Telehouse Europe. In Latin America, our largest competitors include Telefonica, Telmex, and IBM.
For CDN services, our key competitors include Akamai Technologies, Limelight Networks, Amazon, Edgecast Networks (Verizon), Fastly and CDNetworks.
For security services, our key competitors include Akamai, Verizon, CenturyLink, AT&T and Cloudflare.
In the enterprise and government markets, our key competitors in North America include ILECs (such as AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink) and CLECs. In Europe, they include BT, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom and Orange. In Latin America, competitors include Telefonica and Telmex.
The communications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology. For instance, periodic technological advances permit substantial increases in transmission capacity of both new and existing fiber, and the introduction of new products or emergence of new technologies may reduce the cost or increase the supply of certain services similar to those which we plan on providing. Accordingly, in the future our most significant competitors may be new entrants to the communications industry, such as content companies that have existing significant customer bases and substantial cash resources that are greater than ours, and, unlike the traditional incumbent carriers we also compete with, would not be burdened by an installed base of outmoded or legacy equipment.
Regulation
U.S. Regulation
Federal Regulation
The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) has jurisdiction over interstate and international communications services. We have obtained FCC approval to land our transoceanic cables in the United States. We have also obtained FCC authorization to provide international services on a facilities and resale basis, as well as via various wireless licenses. Under the 
 22

Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”), any entity, including cable television companies and electric and gas utilities, may enter any telecommunications market, subject to reasonable state regulation of safety, quality and consumer protection. The United States House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee continues to consider revising and updating the 1996 Act, including potential changes to the FCC, its jurisdiction, its operating procedures and its organizational structure. It is too early in this process for us to either predict any modifications that might be made to the 1996 Act as part of this process, their effects on us, or the pace at which this process may proceed.
The 1996 Act previously required certain tariffs to define the services, terms, and conditions under which said services were to be offered. Subsequent deregulatory measures have eliminated some tariff requirements for competitive services.
Accordingly, as of August 1, 2001, our tariffs for interstate end user services were eliminated and our tariffs for international interexchange services were eliminated on January 28, 2002. Our rates must still be “just and reasonable” and “nondiscriminatory” under the 1996 Act. Our state tariffs remain in place where required (some states do not have, or have eliminated, the requirement to file certain tariffs). We have historically relied primarily on our sales force and marketing activities to provide information to our customers regarding these matters and expect to continue to do so. Further, in accordance with certain FCC tariff filing requirements, we maintain a schedule of our rates, terms and conditions for our domestic and international private line services on our web site.
Special Access Regulation. Special access services are “lit” loop or transport facilities that support the transmission of data on a point-to-point basis, often referred to as “private lines.” Level 3 purchases a substantial amount of special access services from ILECs and other telecommunications carriers to reach customer premises and, less frequently, to support interoffice transport requirements. In addition, Level 3 provides special access services to end user customers and to other carriers via its own network and/or through the resale of other carriers’ special access services.
In January 2005, the FCC commenced an examination of the regulatory framework governing the rates, terms, and conditions under which ILECs subject to “price cap” regulation provide interstate special access services. In this rulemaking, the FCC is reviewing both the price cap regime by which ILEC special access rates are set in most areas, as well as the “pricing flexibility” regime under which ILECs have obtained, in so-called “phase I” areas, the ability to enter into more individualized relationships with customers and to lower prices, and in so-called “phase II” areas, the ability to raise prices based upon certain threshold showings of the presence of competitors in a specific geographic and product market. In August 2012, the FCC froze further grants of pricing flexibility. In December 2012, the FCC issued an order stating that it will gather additional data on a mandatory basis from both providers and purchases of special access services so that it can conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the state of competition in the special access market. Responses to these additional, mandatory data requests were made in early 2015, but we cannot predict when or whether the FCC will complete its review of the data submitted, or what the outcome of its review will be. In 2016, the FCC prospectively limited certain tariff terms of price cap ILECs, known in the industry as “demand lock-up” terms. We cannot predict, however, whether these rulings will be challenged given the new makeup of the FCC following the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, and if challenged, what the result will be.
Network Neutrality and Open Internet. On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted its most recent Open Internet order, the Open Internet Remand Order. The 2015 Order prohibits broadband providers from: blocking access to lawful content; impairing or degrading (also known as throttling) Internet traffic; prioritizing some content over other content in exchange for payment or other consideration; or unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging the ability of users to access lawful content. The 2015 Order also provides the Commission with authority to hear complaints regarding 
 23

interconnection disputes with broadband providers. The 2015 Order was challenged in court and, in an initial ruling, was upheld, but the appeal process is still on-going. There have also been a variety of legislative efforts to water down the 2015 Order, and the 2015 Order may be revisited given the new makeup of the FCC following the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. We cannot predict the outcome of such initiatives.
IP Interconnection. We have noted IP interconnection and congestion disputes with last mile bottleneck broadband providers, some of which historically refused to augment (or add) bandwidth at congested interconnection links between our respective networks (which is known to degrade the quality of third party content) without the payment of tolls unilaterally dictated by the broadband supplier. During 2015 and 2016, we concluded improved IP Interconnection agreements with several large broadband providers, some of which were announced publicly. We cannot predict at this time whether these arrangements will in all cases provide us with sufficient last mile interconnection capacity to avoid Internet congestion as the Internet continues to grow and/or when these agreements expire. The FCC’s current Open Internet rules provide Level 3 a forum to lodge interconnection disputes with the FCC for resolution, but how such disputes would be resolved, as well as the future of these Open Internet Rules, is unclear (see “Network Neutrality and Open Internet” discussion immediately above).
Intercarrier Compensation. Telecommunications carriers compensate one another for traffic carried on each other’s networks. Interexchange carriers pay access charges to local telephone companies for long distance calls that originate and terminate on local networks. Local telephone companies typically charge one another for local and Internet-bound traffic terminating on each other’s networks. The methodology by which carriers compensate one another for exchanged traffic, whether it be for local, intrastate or interstate traffic, has been under review by the FCC for over a decade.
In November 2011, the FCC released its Universal Service Fund/Intercarrier Compensation Transformation Order (USF/ICC Transformation Order). Along with addressing other matters, the USF/ ICC Transformation Order established a prospective intercarrier compensation framework for terminating switched access and VoIP traffic. Under the USF/ICC Transformation Order and subsequent related FCC orders, most terminating switched access charges and all reciprocal compensation charges were capped at then-current levels, and will be reduced to zero over, as relevant to Level 3, generally a six year transition period that began July 1, 2012.
Level 3 maintains approximately 300 interconnection agreements with other telecommunications carriers. These agreements set out the terms and conditions under which the parties will exchange traffic. The largest agreements are with AT&T and Verizon. Most of Level 3’s agreements with AT&T and Verizon have expired terms, but remain effective in evergreen status. As these and other interconnection agreements expire, we will continue to evaluate simply allowing them to continue in evergreen status (so long as the counterparty allows it) or negotiating new agreements. Any renegotiation would involve uncertainty as to the final terms and conditions, including the compensation rates for various types of traffic. In addition, changes in law, including FCC orders, may allow or compel us to renegotiate current and successor interconnection agreements over the next year.
Intercarrier Compensation/VoIP. Pursuant to the USF/ICC Transformation Order, VoIP, while remaining unclassified as either an information or a telecommunications service, was prospectively categorized as either local or non-local traffic. If “local”, then VoIP traffic is subject to reciprocal compensation; if “non-local”, then it is subject to interstate rates, thus eliminating any intrastate access rate applicable to VoIP. The USF/ICC Transformation Order did not address the treatment of VoIP retroactively. Level 3 is involved in a number of intercarrier compensation disputes dealing with the rating of VoIP traffic. During 2015, the FCC issued clarifications concerning the rating of VoIP traffic that were favorable to Level 3. Those clarifications were appealed, with the Court ruling that 
 24

additional action by the FCC is required to sustain its prior findings. This initial ruling has been further appealed. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of these appeals.
Other VoIP Regulation. The FCC has imposed various regulatory requirements on VoIP providers that had previously been applicable only to traditional telecommunications providers, such as obligations to provide 911 functionality, contribute to the federal universal service fund, to comply with regulations relating to local number portability (including contributing to the costs of managing number portability requirements), to abide by the FCC’s service discontinuance rules, to contribute to the Telecommunications Relay Services fund, and to abide by the regulations concerning Customer Proprietary Network Information and the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. In addition, a number of state public utility commissions are conducting regulatory proceedings that could affect our rights and obligations with respect to IP-based voice applications. Specifically, some states have taken the position that the “local” component of VoIP service is subject to traditional regulations applicable to local telecommunications services, such as the obligation to pay intrastate universal service fees. We cannot predict whether the FCC or state public utility commissions will impose additional requirements, regulations or charges upon our provision of services related to IP communications.
Intercarrier Compensation/Wireless. There are currently a number of lawsuits ongoing in the United States concerning the intercarrier compensation charges applicable to certain wireless telephone calls, how to determine whether those calls were local or long distance under the applicable rules, and what statute of limitations applies to such claims. We are defendants in certain of these lawsuits, and are potential plaintiffs in others. As with any litigation, the outcome of this litigation is difficult to predict.
Universal Service. Level 3 is subject to federal and state regulations that implement universal service support for access to communications services in rural and high-cost areas and to low-income consumers at reasonable rates; and access to advanced communications services by schools, libraries and rural health care providers. The FCC assesses Level 3 a percentage of interstate and international revenue it receives from retail customers as its contribution to the Federal Universal Service Fund, which assessments are generally passed on to our customers. Additionally, the FCC has ruled that states may assess contributions to their state Universal Service Funds from VoIP providers. Any change in the assessment methodology may affect Level 3’s revenue and expenses, but at this time it is not possible to predict the extent we would be affected, if at all.
Network Security Agreement. In connection with the acquisition of Global Crossing, we entered into an agreement (the “Network Security Agreement”) with certain agencies of the U.S. Government to address the U.S. Government’s national security and law enforcement concerns. The Network Security Agreement is intended (i) to ensure our ability to carry out lawfully authorized U.S. Government electronic surveillance of communications that originate and/or terminate in the U.S.; (ii) to prevent and detect access to and use of U.S. communications; and (iii) to satisfy U.S. critical infrastructure protection requirements. Failure to comply with our obligations under the Network Security Agreement could result in the revocation of our telecommunications licenses by the FCC and other penalties. The Network Security Agreement also imposes significant requirements related to information storage and management, traffic routing and management, physical, logical and network security, personnel screening and training, audit, reporting and other matters.
State Regulation
The 1996 Act is intended to increase competition in the telecommunications industry, especially in the local exchange market. With respect to local services, ILECs are required to allow interconnection to their networks and to provide unbundled access to network facilities, as well as a number of other pro-competitive measures. 
 25

State regulatory agencies have jurisdiction when our facilities and services are used to provide intrastate telecommunications services. A portion of our traffic may be classified as intrastate telecommunications and therefore subject to state regulation. We expect that we will offer more intrastate telecommunications services (including intrastate switched services) as our business and product lines expand. We are authorized to provide telecommunications services in all fifty states and the District of Columbia. In addition, we need to maintain interconnection agreements with ILECs where we wish to provide service. We expect that we should be able to negotiate or otherwise obtain renewals or successor agreements through adoption of others’ contracts or through arbitration proceedings, although the rates, terms, and conditions applicable to interconnection and the exchange of traffic with certain ILECs could change significantly in certain cases. The degree to which the rates, terms, and conditions may change will depend not only upon the negotiation and arbitration process and availability of other interconnection agreements, but will also depend in significant part upon state commission proceedings that either uphold or modify the current regimes governing interconnection and the exchange of certain kinds of traffic between carriers.
There are initiatives in several state legislatures to lower intrastate access rates, aligning them with interstate rates, some of which may be affected by the FCC Order on intercarrier compensation. While we believe that rate adjustment initiatives such as this are generally better considered holistically by the FCC as part of its overall intercarrier compensation reforms, some states have and may continue to determine otherwise. Depending on whether we are a net collector or a net payer of any adjusted rate, such rate adjustments could have a negative effect on us.
Some states also require prior approvals or notifications for certain transfers of assets, customers or ownership of certificated carriers and for issuances by certified carriers of equity or debt.
Local Regulation
Our networks are subject to numerous local regulations such as building/permitting/trenching codes and licensing/franchise fees. Such regulations vary on a city-by-city, county-by-county and state-by-state basis. To install our own fiber optic transmission facilities, we need to obtain rights-of-way over privately and publicly owned land. Rights-of-way that are not already secured, or which may expire and not be renewed, may not be available to us on economically reasonable or advantageous terms in the future.
European Regulation
Unlike the United States which has a federal-state regulatory scheme, the European Union, or EU, has adopted a more systematic approach to the convergence of networks and the regulation of telecommunications services. The European Commission oversees the implementation by its Member States of various directives developed to regulate electronic communications. In March 2002, the European Union adopted a new regulatory framework for electronic communications that is designed to address in a technologically neutral manner the convergence of communications across telecommunications, computer and broadcasting networks. The directives address: (1) framework, (2) interconnection and access, (3) authorization and licensing, (4) universal service, and (5) privacy. These directives along with an additional decision on radio spectrum set out the basis for regulation at the national level.
Pursuant to these measures, the licensing regime was replaced with one of general authorization, whereby all providers of electronic communication services, or ECS, are authorized by statute in all 28 EU countries to (1) build/maintain a network and (2) sell any form of ECS, other than mobile or broadcast services, without the need for an individual license. Accordingly, as for all communications providers, our existing licenses were canceled and replaced with statutory 
 26

authorization, subject to various general conditions imposed by national regulatory authorities, or NRAs. NRAs continue to be responsible for issuing specific licenses in relation to radio spectrum.
The Framework requires NRAs, on a rolling basis, to analyze a set of markets for electronic communications which may require ex-ante regulation to function competitively.
This analysis contains three different elements:

• | Market definition - first the NRA must define the relevant geographic and product market.


• | SMP assessment - in a second step the NRA must analyze whether one or more undertaking active in that market possesses significant market power (conceptually similar to dominance), either individually or jointly with others.


• | Decision on remedies - if the NRA identifies a market with a lack of effective competition, it is required to impose certain regulatory obligations, so-called remedies.

The basis for this measure is the European Commission’s Recommendation on Relevant Markets, which contains a list of markets that should be subject to ex ante regulation. Whenever a NRA concludes that a given market shows failures that hamper competition, it must impose appropriate remedies on undertakings with a significant market power in accordance with the market Access Directive and Universal Service Directives.
In November 2009, the European Parliament and Council of Ministers agreed to implement a number of changes to the existing regime, comprising the “Better Regulation” Directive (Directive 2009/140/EC) and the “Citizens’ Rights” Directive (Directive 2009/136/EC), which adjust the existing regulations in order to remove areas of potential ambiguity and more clearly define user rights.
In 2010, the EU adopted a long term strategic policy known as the Digital Agenda for Europe 2010 - 2020, aimed at ensuring that the EU derives the maximum economic, industrial and social benefit from advanced communications services, including the extensive roll-out of ‘superfast broadband.’ The majority of Member States have each adopted their own national policies in support of this high level agenda. 
In November 2015, the EU adopted Regulation EU 2015/2120 which, among other things set out new legislation in relation to open internet. The net neutrality provisions of this Regulation became effective at the beginning of the second quarter 2016. In 2015, the EU Commission also began a review of the entire suite of Directives and Regulations relating to the communications sector and proposals are currently under consideration with a view to agreeing any changes in sufficient time to have these transposed into Member State law by 2019.
Notwithstanding a synchronized approach to regulation in Europe, the implementation of the directives has not been uniform across the Member States of the European Union. Recognizing this concern, in November 2009, the EU also implemented one regulation establishing the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (Regulation (EC) No 1211/2009), or BEREC. BEREC’s objective is to improve harmonization between national regulatory measures so as to ensure greater consistency of remedies and to anticipate emerging regulatory requirements. From 2012 through 2016, BEREC adopted a common position on several issues of relevance, including wholesale local and broadband access, wholesale leased lines and net neutrality. BEREC’s work program for 2017 published in January 2017, identifies four key areas of focus: (1) promoting competition and investment, with a particular focus on promoting investment in infrastructure and preparing for market developments relating to IP applications; (2) ensuring NRA support for activities that promote the EU internal market, including 
 27

the ongoing review of the regulatory framework (3) empowering and protecting end-users; and (4) improving the quality and efficiency of regulatory decision making. 
United Kingdom ‘Brexit’ 
In June 2016, following a national referendum, the UK decided to cease its membership in the EU. The European Treaty sets out the legal process that must be followed to accomplish this departure, but has not yet been triggered. It is generally expected that the UK will remain a member of the EU until at least 2019. While there is likely to be little immediate effect for the company or its customers, the longer term implications are presently unclear.
Middle East and African Regulation
In recent years, we have expanded our operations beyond the borders of the European Union. While a number of jurisdictions have adopted regulatory regimes broadly similar to the European model and promote full competition, many of the countries in this region have not yet committed to liberalizing their telecommunications regimes and opening their telecommunications markets to foreign investment as part of the 1998 World Trade Organization Agreement on Basic Telecommunications Services. We cannot be certain of how many regional countries may ultimately liberalize their national markets or how quickly change may take place and the effect on our business of future regulatory change cannot be accurately predicted.
Canadian Regulation
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (“CRTC”) regulates telecommunications providers and their service offerings in Canada. Regulatory developments over the past several years have terminated the historic monopolies of the ILECs, bringing significant competition to this industry for both domestic and international long distance services. The provision of Canadian domestic and international transmission facilities based services is no longer restricted to “Canadian carriers”. Prior to June 2012, these carriers had to have majority ownership and control in-fact by Canadians. There are no such Canadian ownership and control requirements for companies that resell the services and facilities of a Canadian carrier. Accordingly, we have historically operated as a reseller of Canadian domestic and international transmission facilities-based services in Canada. Material ownership restrictions were repealed, thus allowing us to register with the CRTC as a facilities-based telecommunications common carrier, which we did and also obtained a Basic International Telecommunications Service license, allowing us to carry traffic that originates or terminates in points outside of Canada.
Latin American Regulation
The regulatory status of the telecommunications markets in Latin America varies to some degree. All of the countries in which we currently operate are members of the World Trade Organization, and most have committed to some deregulatory measures such as market competition and foreign ownership. Some countries now permit competition for all telecommunications facilities and services, while others allow less competition for some facilities and services, but restrict competition for other services. The telecommunications regulatory regimes of many Latin American countries are in the process of development. Many issues, such as regulation of incumbent providers, interconnection, unbundling of local loops, resale of telecommunications services, and pricing have not been addressed fully, or even at all. We cannot accurately predict whether and how these issues will be resolved, or their effect on our operations.
 28

Below is a summary of certain of the regulations currently applicable to our Latin American operations, by country. The regulations apply equally to all of our operating entities in a given country.
Argentina 
The regulatory framework of the Argentine telecommunications sector is changing. The 
Argentine telecommunications sector is subject to national Law “Argentina Digital” No. 27,078 of 
December 16, 2014 (the “ICT Law”) which replaced (i) former Law No. 19,798 (the former Telecommunications Law), as amended, which had governed the operation of telecommunications companies in Argentina since August 1972; and (ii) Decree No. 764/2000, as amended, which opened the Argentine telecommunications market to competition in September 2000, established rules for the granting of licenses for telecommunications services, interconnection, the management and control of the radio spectrum and a Universal Service Fund regime. 
The ICT Law established that Law No. 19,798 and Decree No. 764/2000, its supplementary laws and decrees, will remain in full force and effect as long as they do not contradict the ICT Law and until the regulatory authority enacts the required new supporting regulatory framework. 
On January 4, 2016, a Necessity and Urgency Decree No. 267/2015 (“Decree 267”) was published which basically: (i) partially amended the ICT Law; (ii) created a new control authority called the ENACOM (Ente Nacional de Comunicaciones) to replace the former authority (AFTIC), an entity under the jurisdiction of the Argentine Communications Ministry, that is in charge of the telecommunications and audiovisual communications industry; and (iii) created a special committee for the purpose of drafting a unified and updated new law that will replace the ICT Law (the “New ICT Law”). 
Most relevant aspects to our business (such as the licensing processes, USF regime, interconnection regime and spectrum regime) set forth under the former Law No. 19,798 and Decree No. 764/2000, and its supplementary laws, continue in full force until the enactment of the New ICT Law. The special committee created by Decree 267 is expected to submit a new a bill of the New ICT Law to Congress during 2017.
Brazil 
Law No. 9,472, of 16 July 1997, known as the General Telecommunications Law (“LGT”), provides for the organization of telecommunications services in Brazil (which includes the regulation of the performance, provision and use of services, and the implementation and operation of telecommunications networks, as well as the use of orbit resources and radio-frequency spectrums) and creates the National Telecommunications Agency (“ANATEL”), the regulatory agency, which shall act independently, impartially, legally, impersonally and publicly. 
ANATEL has generally pursued a policy of market liberalization and supported a competitive telecommunications environment. In order to foster effective competition and prohibit economic concentration in the market, the agency may establish restrictions, limits or conditions for companies, or groups of companies, regarding obtaining and transferring concessions, permits and authorizations to render telecommunications’ services. 
The convergence of services, the rapid changes in technology, the poor quality of telecommunication services being delivered to most of the population in the consumer market and the economic crisis in Brazil, among other factors, are leading ANATEL to consider a variety of changes to the current telecommunications regulation framework. During 2017, we expect several measures with significant changes in the regulatory model, thus promoting the unification of private and public regimes, a certain level of deregulation and quality of service obligations. 
 29

The Internet Civil Framework approved by Law 12.965/2014 provides for network neutrality and prohibits broadband providers from impairing or degrading (also known as throttling) Internet traffic to different Internet applications; prioritizing traffic or some content; or unreasonably interfering with or hindering the ability of users to access lawful content. The party responsible for the transmission, switching or routing has the duty to process, on an isonomic basis, any data packages, regardless of content, origin and destination, service, terminal or application and the legal discrimination or degradation of traffic, although still subject to further regulation, can only result from: (i) technical requirements essential to the adequate provision of services and applications; and (ii) prioritization of emergency services.
Chile
The telecommunications industry in Chile is regulated by the Undersecretariat of Telecommunications, a department under the Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunications.
In 1978, the National Policy on Telecommunications was issued which, in its most relevant aspects, called for the development of telecommunications services to be conducted by private institutions through authorizations granted by the government. However, it also endorsed a series of regulations aimed at establishing increased technical control over such investments and conferring certain discretionary powers upon the government. The policy was formalized through the General Law on Telecommunications approved in 1982, in which free, non-discriminatory access was granted to private firms in the development of the nation’s telecommunications services. This law established responsibilities with respect to telecommunication services, compulsory interconnection of facilities between public service licensees, and effectuated mandatory tariffing of services where existing market conditions were deemed insufficient to guarantee a free tariff system.
Chile amended its General Law on Telecommunications in 1985 to provide that concessions and permits may be granted without limit depending upon the quantity and type of service and geographic location. The law guarantees interconnection among telecommunications service concessionaires. Chile defines value added services as supplementary services. It is not necessary to have a telecommunications service license to offer supplementary services, although those who provide additional services must comply with the technical standards established by the Department of Telecommunications, and obtain authorization therefrom.
The General Law on Telecommunications has been amended on several occasions regarding such matters as network neutrality, the recent elimination of domestic long distance telephony, and full implementation of number portability, and establishing a national plan for critical telecommunications infrastructure to ensure continuity of services.
Colombia
The telecommunication industry in Colombia is subject to regulation by the Colombian Ministry of Communications. Since 1991, the Colombian Government has pursued a policy of liberalization and has encouraged joint ventures between public and private telecommunication companies to provide new and improved telecommunication services. In 2009, the Colombian government adopted a new regulatory regime (Law 1341, the “TIC law”) that was aimed at further deregulating the telecommunications market.
The telecommunication industry in Colombia is subject to regulation by the Communications Regulation Commission (CRC), the National Spectrum Agency (ANE) and the National Television Authority (ANTV).
The competition authority and consumer protection agency in Colombia is the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce (SIC), which is responsible for enforcing antitrust 
 30

regulations, protecting consumers’ rights and promoting competition in all economic sectors, including telecommunications.
The Ministry of Information and Communications Technologies (“ICT”) is in charge of telecommunications policymaking, and the Minister is a member of the board of the regulatory bodies (CRC, ANTV and ANE).
The TIC Law created a new ICT register to facilitate market entry by telecommunications operators, as licenses were no longer tied to the provision of telecommunications services in Colombia. If services providers require spectrum the Ministry granted a spectrum use permit. During 2015, the CRC and the Ministry of Information and Communications Technologies (“MinICT”) issued regulations and policies to promote and improve competition in the telecommunications sector in Colombia, relating to, among other things, customer contracts, reporting, interconnection charges in the mobile market and certain local accounting rules.
The Colombian government issued the National Development Plan (NDP), which is intended to increase competition and the use of information technology and communications in the country. The NDP contains provisions to allow for the efficient deployment of infrastructure and services.
The Colombian government is interested in joining the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, and this will require the adoption of some reforms in the telecommunication sector, such as measures to ensure the independence of the regulatory authorities, eliminate concentration in fixed and mobile markets and remove barriers to network infrastructure deployment, which would not affect our business in Colombia.
Costa Rica
Costa Rica was the last country in Central America to liberalize the telecommunications market. Following ratification of the free trade agreement between the US and Central American States, in 2007, through the enactment of the General Telecommunications Law in 2008, and the appointment of the Telecommunications Superintendence (“SUTEL”) as market regulator in 2009, Costa Rica consolidated the opening to competition of the telecommunications sector. SUTEL is an administrative body within the former Public Services Regulatory Authority (ARESEP) and as market regulator holds responsibilities such as: implementing policy and legislation, regulating the market entry by service providers and the services, imposing access and interconnection obligations, resolving intercarrier and unfair competition disputes, approving both retail tariffs (only if there are no effective competition conditions within the market) and adhesion contracts with end users, overseeing the universal service fund (FONATEL), and managing scarce resources, including numbers and radio spectrum. SUTEL also ensures compliance with consumer protections and promotes competition in the telecommunications sector.
The executive branch retains certain direct responsibilities in the telecom sector through the Ministry of Science, Technology and Telecommunications (“MICITT”), which is the main authority for the promotion and definition of national telecommunications policy, including the definition of a national plan for the development of telecommunications and granting spectrum licenses.
In 2014, SUTEL started to conduct market research on the prices of submarine cable access services in Costa Rica, to determine whether prices in that country are competitive in comparison with international prices. The final report on this research has not been released yet.
At the end of 2014, SUTEL announced that it expects to review the conditions for effective competition in the various telecommunications markets in Costa Rica (fixed, mobile, data, etc.), which could lead to the liberalization of the prices of telecommunication services in some markets or a review of new regulatory rulings to promote competition. 
 31

In October 2015, MICITT released the National Telecommunications Plan 2015-2021. The plan addresses the main objectives for the growth of the telecommunications sector until 2021 and the telecommunications market milestones. These objectives are mandatory both to MICITT and SUTEL regarding the spectrum procurement proceedings and the procurement proceedings financed through FONATEL.
Since 2015, there has also been an important reform process to the regulatory framework, implemented through the enactment of new regulations concerning subjects such as infrastructure sharing, quality of services, end user rights, pricing and tariffs, privacy of communications, universal access and services, among others.
Following a public consultation on the studies reviewing the conditions for competition in various telecommunications markets in Costa Rica, in December 2016, SUTEL declared effective competition in four of the telecommunications markets: International Telephony, Fixed Internet, International Roaming, and Telecommunications Transit. These markets thereon will no longer have a tariff regulation. The government determined that the Origination, Termination in individual fixed networks, Termination in individual mobile networks, and Fixed telephony markets do not present conditions for effective competition, and will therefore remain under tariff regulation. Lastly, SUTEL postponed the decision concerning the ‘Mobile Telecommunications’, ‘Access and Origination in a Mobile Network’, and ’Loop Unbundling’ markets to the first quarter of 2017.
On December 2016, SUTEL also published the official invitation for the tendering of 70 MHz of spectrum in the 1800 MHz and 1900/2100 MHz bands, intended for the provision of mobile telephony and mobile internet services.
Ecuador
A Law of Telecommunications was enacted in February of 2015. As a result, the organizational structure of public entities in Ecuador will changed with the creation of the Agency for the Regulation and Control of Telecommunications (“ARCOTEL”), which will be responsible for the planning, regulation and control of telecommunications services as well as spectrum management.
The Ministry of Telecommunications will remain in charge of the development of information and communication technologies in Ecuador. It issues policies and general plans and monitors their implementation. The Ministry also evaluates, coordinates and promotes actions to ensure equal access to services and the effective and efficient use thereof. 
Mexico
In June, 2013, the Mexican government performed an integral amendment of the regime, through the enactment of a Constitutional Decree. Such Decree included the modification of the Mexican Constitution and several legislative measures that have been requiring a series of further regulations amending the main regulatory framework of the telecommunications industry. Some of the most important aspects set forth in the amendment are the following: (i) the Federal Institution of Telecommunications (“IFT”) was created as a constitutionally autonomous entity, replacing the existing Federal Telecommunications Commission (“COFETEL”), as the sole telecommunications regulatory body; and (ii) foreign investment was allowed with up to 100% in telecommunications and satellite communication services (previously capped at 49%) and up to 49% in broadcasting services (previously prohibited).
A telecommunications law was approved by the Federal Congress of Mexico and became effective on August 13, 2014.
 32

The telecommunications sector in Mexico is regulated primarily by the IFT. Among other aspects, the IFT regulates the requirements for licensing public telecommunications networks, and the obligations of telecommunication companies in Mexico. Further, it manages licensing requirements for radioelectric spectrum, satellite geostationary orbits assigned to Mexico and its related spectrum, makes declarations of preponderant agents in the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors (more than 50% of the users, subscribers, audience, network traffic or used network capacity, measured on a national basis), analyzes the divestiture and restructuring plans submitted by Preponderant agents to reconsider their status and authorizations to commercialize telecommunications services.
Under the new telecommunications law, the provision of value-added services has been deregulated. Also, there is a new concession-granting regime, which establishes a unique concession for the provision of all telecommunication services. The unique concession may be granted by the IFT only to Mexican individuals or companies, but there will be no limitation on foreign investment. However, the concessions granted before the new law was enacted, will remain valid until they expire or the operator decides to apply for a master concession (transition regime).
On March 6 2014, the IFT declared America Movil SAB de CV, Telefonos de Mexico SAB de CV, and Grupo Carso, among other companies, to be preponderant agents in the telecommunications sector, and Grupo Televisa, among others, to be a preponderant agent in the open broadcast television sector. The divestiture plan submitted by America Movil is pending approval.
The IFT may impose additional asymmetric regulations and specific obligations upon preponderant agents such as rates, quality, shared-use of infrastructure, rights of way and disaggregation of the local telecommunication network.
Some important regulatory measures were issued by the IFT in 2015: (i) the application of no charge for the interconnection with networks of the preponderant agents and (ii) the modification of tariffs for national long distances telephony services due to the Mexican territory treatment as a local area.
While the IFT provides the main regulatory framework of the telecommunications industry, other relevant laws in the field are the Federal Antitrust Law, the Foreign Investment Law, the Law of Protection of Personal Information in Possession of Private Entities, and the Federal Consumers Protection Law, all of which play a part in the overall regulation of the sector, in addition to the general commerce and contractual laws. The above mentioned laws also shall be adjusted to the new telecommunication law.
The enactment of the new law and the initial measures taken by the IFT in 2014 have increased the dynamism of the Mexican telecommunications market, in which the main players are moving faster and new players are emerging.
In 2016 the IFT issued the Guidelines for Collaboration with Justice which came into force on January 1, 2016, and brought about several new obligations for the telecommunications concessionaires and authorization holders. However, the implementation of such Guidelines is still not completely clear, as the IFT’s criterion is that every concessionaire and authorization holder is responsible for complying with the Guidelines, even when its technical and operative capabilities do not allow them to gather the information required by the Guidelines.
Panama
In Panama the telecommunications market was privatized in 1997 and deregulated in 2003, and services have seen strong growth since that time. Due to the comparative advantages of the geographical location of Panama there is a significant supply of subsea connections.
 33

The telecommunications industry in Panama is regulated by Autoridad Nacional de los Servicios Públicos or ASEP (formerly Ente Regulador de los Servicios Públicos), an independent regulatory body. ASEP is a multi-sector regulator in charge of all Panama utilities including telecommunications. 
Peru
The telecommunications industry in Peru is regulated by the Supervisory Authority for Private Investment in Telecommunications (“OSIPTEL”) and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (“MTC”). OSIPTEL is an independent regulatory body attached to the Office of the President of the Council of Ministers.
Under Peruvian law, the provision of public telecommunications services requires a concession. The functions related to the issuance of concessions and market access registration and the assignment of the radio spectrum for public telecommunications services are managed by the MTC’s General Directorate of Concessions in Telecommunications. Since market liberalization became effective in August 1998, there has been no limitation on the issuance of concessions, except for services subject to natural limitations on grounds of scarce resources, as in the case of the radio spectrum.
During 2014, the National Congress submitted a General Telecommunication Bill which would modify the existing general regulatory regime. The bill remains under debate and has not yet been passed.
Uruguay
The telecom market in Uruguay is highly regulated. The Executive Branch, through the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mining, is the final authority in regards with telecom matters, while the Telecom National Office (Dirección Nacional de Telecomunicaciones) works as a general advisory body and the Communication Services Regulatory Unit URSEC (Unidad Reguladora de Servicios de Comunicaciones) participates as a regulatory agency.
To provide telecommunications services, it is necessary to hold a license. Moreover, if the service also requires the assignment of spectrum, it is also necessary to have a concession. The Executive Branch grants licenses to broadcast and also grants assignments of spectrum with a fixed term. URSEC is entitled to grant licenses and concessions in all the remaining cases. The international long distance telephony is a closed market with approximately ten players operating in that market. Through our Uruguayan branch, we are licensed for data transmission services and as an international long distance service provider. 
Venezuela
The Venezuelan telecommunications industry is regulated by the Comisión Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (“CONATEL of Venezuela”), which is ascribed to and under the purview of the Minister of People’s Power for Communication and Information. Venezuela opened its telecommunications market to competition on November 28, 2000. In 2007, the Venezuelan government nationalized the incumbent telecommunications operator, CANTV. In December 2010, the government issued a new law declaring that the provision of telecommunications services is an activity of the “public domain.” To date, the government has not indicated its intent to expand nationalization within the telecommunications sector.
The Venezuelan government restricts the setting of fees for telecommunication services, limiting the ability of service providers to adjust their fees in response to Venezuela’s high inflation rate
Asian Regulation
 34

The status of liberalization of the telecommunications regulatory regimes of the Asian countries in which we operate or may in the future operate varies. Some countries allow full competition in the telecommunications sector, while others limit competition for many or most services. Similarly, some countries in Asia maintain foreign ownership restrictions which limit the amount of foreign direct investment and require foreign companies to seek local joint venture partners. 
Most of the countries in the region have committed to liberalizing their telecommunications regimes and opening their telecommunications markets to foreign investment as part of the World Trade Organization Agreement on Basic Telecommunications Services, which came into force in 1998. Additionally, the United States has entered into bilateral Free Trade Agreements with Singapore, Australia and South Korea that became effective in 2003, 2005 and 2012, respectively, and a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement with Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam that was concluded in 2015. We cannot predict what effect, if any, these agreements will have on other countries in the region or whether the U.S. will pursue similar agreements with other countries. We also cannot be certain whether this liberalizing trend will continue or accurately predict the pace and scope of liberalization. It is possible that one or more of the countries in which we operate or may in the future operate will slow or halt the liberalization of its telecommunications markets. The effect on us of such an action cannot be accurately predicted.
The telecommunications regulatory regimes of many Asian countries are in the process of development. Many issues, such as regulation of incumbent providers, interconnection, unbundling of local loops, resale of telecommunications services, offering of voice services and pricing have not been addressed fully or at all. We cannot accurately predict whether or how these issues will be resolved and their effect on our operations in Asia.
Glossary of Terms

caching | A process by which a Web storage device or cache is located between Web servers (or origin servers) and a user, and watches requests for HTML pages and objects such as images, audio, and video, then saves a copy for itself. If there is another request for the same object, the cache will use its copy, instead of asking the origin server for it again.
capacity | The information carrying ability of a communications facility. 
carrier | A provider of communications transmission services by fiber, wire or radio. 

 35


CDN | Content Distribution Network or CDN describes a system of computers networked together across the Internet that cooperate transparently to deliver various types of content to end users. The delivery process is optimized generally for either performance or cost. When optimizing for performance, locations that can serve content quickly to the user are chosen. When optimizing for cost, locations that are less expensive to serve from may be chosen instead.
central office | Telephone company facility where subscribers’ lines are joined to switching equipment for connecting other subscribers to each other, locally and long distance. 
CLEC | Competitive Local Exchange Carrier. A company that competes with ILECs in the local services market. 
co-carrier | A relationship between a CLEC and an ILEC that affords each company the same access to and right on the other’s network and provides access and services on an equal basis.

fiber optics | A technology in which light is used to transport information from one point to another. Fiber optic cables are thin filaments of glass through which light beams are transmitted over long distances carrying enormous amounts of data. Modulating light on thin strands of glass produces major benefits including high bandwidth, relatively low cost, low power consumption, small space needs and total insensitivity to electromagnetic interference. 
Gateway | Gateways are the primary technical facilities in the markets we serve. They are the endpoints of each long haul city-pair segment. Where we have metro rings, they are the locations most metro rings home to. 
Gbps | Gigabits per second. A transmission rate. One gigabit equals 1.024 billion bits of information. 
ISDN | Integrated Services Digital Network. An information transfer standard for transmitting digital voice and data over telephone lines at speeds up to 128 Kbps. 
ILEC | Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier. A company historically providing local telephone service. Often refers to one of the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs). Often referred to as “LEC” (Local Exchange Carrier). 
Interconnection | Interconnection of facilities between or among the networks of carriers, including potential physical colocation of one carrier’s equipment in the other carrier’s premises to facilitate such interconnection.

long distance carriers | Long distance carriers provide services between local exchanges on an interstate or intrastate basis. A long distance carrier may offer services over its own or another carrier’s facilities. 
Mbps | Megabits per second. A transmission rate. One megabit equals 1.024 million bits of information. 
MPLS | MultiProtocol Label Switching. A standards approved technology for speeding up network traffic flow and making it easier to manage. MPLS involves setting up a specific path for a given sequence of packets, identified by a label put in each packet, thus saving the time needed for a router or switch to look up the address to the next node to forward the packet to. 
multiplexing | An electronic or optical process that combines a large number of lower speed transmission lines into one high speed line by splitting the total available bandwidth into narrower bands (frequency division), or by allotting a common channel to several different transmitting devices, one at a time in sequence (time division).

The functions of a PBX include routing incoming calls to the appropriate extension in an office, sharing phone lines between extensions, automated greetings for callers using recorded messages, dialing menus, connections to voicemail, automatic call distribution and teleconferencing. 
peering | The commercial practice under which ISPs exchange traffic with each other. Although ISPs are free to make a private commercial arrangement, there are generally two types of peering. With a settlement free peering arrangement the ISPs do not need to pay each other for the exchange of traffic. With paid peering, the larger ISP receives payment from the smaller ISP to carry the traffic of that smaller ISP. Peering occurs at both public and private exchange points. 
POP | Point of Presence. Telecommunications facility where a communications provider locates network equipment used to connect customers to its network backbone. 
private line | A dedicated telecommunications connection between end user locations.

router | Equipment placed between networks that relays data to those networks based upon a destination address contained in the data packets being routed. 
selective router | Telephone switch or functional equivalent, controlled by the relevant local exchange carrier (LEC), which determines the public safety answering point to which a 911 call should be delivered based on the location of the 911 caller. 
SONET | Synchronous Optical Network. An electronics and network architecture for variable bandwidth products which enables transmission of voice, data and video (multimedia) at very high speeds. SONET ring architecture provides for virtually instantaneous restoration of service in the event of a fiber cut or equipment failure by automatically rerouting traffic in the opposite direction around the ring. 
special access services | The lease of private, dedicated telecommunications lines or “circuits” along the network of a local exchange company or a CAP, which lines or circuits run to or from the long distance carrier POPs. Examples of special access services are telecommunications lines running between POPs of a single long distance carrier, from one long distance carrier POP to the POP of another long distance carrier or from an end user to a long distance carrier POP.
streaming | Streaming is the delivery of media, such as movies and live presentations, over a network in real time. A computer (a streaming server) sends the media to another computer (a client computer), which plays the media as it is delivered. 
switch | A device that selects the paths or circuits to be used for transmission of information and establishes a connection. Switching is the process of interconnecting circuits to form a transmission path between users and it also captures information for billing purposes. 
Tbps | Terabits per second. A transmission rate. One terabit equals 1.024 trillion bits of information. 
TDM | Time Division Multiplexing. A technology that transmits multiple signals simultaneously over a single transmission path. 
unbundled | Services, programs, software and training sold separately from the hardware. 
unbundled access | Access to unbundled elements of a telecommunications services provider’s network including network facilities, equipment, features, functions and capabilities, at any technically feasible point within such network. 
VoIP | Voice over Internet Protocol.
