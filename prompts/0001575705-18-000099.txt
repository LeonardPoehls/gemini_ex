MEDICAL BILLING
 
Healthcare Business Services Groups, Inc. (Delaware Corporation a subsidiary of the Nevada Company) moved its office from 1120 W Foothill Blvd Suite 105 and 106 Upland, CA 91786 and moved to 818 N Mountain Ave, Suite 200, Upland, CA 91786 which was approximately 2600 sqft prestigious space as of July 1, 2008 with month to month rent.
SUBSIDIARY - AUTOMED
 
AUTOMATED MEDICAL BILLING SOFTWARE (A Nevada Company)
 
“AutoMed” was initially formed to satisfy its custom medical billing needs. “Healthcare” began implementing AutoMed in its Medical Billing line of business in July 2003. “Healthcare” has been using AutoMed since October 2003 for all new medical billing.
 
The “Registrant” intends to promote AutoMed for other aspects of medical office management as well, as discussed below.
 
We sold the first copy of our AutoMed program license in January of 2008 and installed in March of 2008 into general/internal medical clinic. The program was sold for 39 doctors for a selling price of $230,000. Due to the product being new to the market, we only installed the program for one physician with initial deposit of $62,000. We used these funds to customize the program for the clinic, travel, technical, installation and training. We have received an additional $5,000 in the second quarter of 2008. There are multiple interests at this point from the hospital, surgery center and other medical professionals who seek to use AutoMed program. Additional funding of $2.2 million dollars to effect its business plan and to promote AutoMed program through out the United States of America.
 
DEPENDENCE ON ONE OR A FEW CUSTOMERS
 
“Healthcare” depended on few customers throughout the United States to continue in the medical billing field with few loyal Clients. Due to our higher fees (10%) to perform a customized service to deliver a higher cash flow to our clients, we have experienced that a few of the former clients were the largest competitors of Healthcare Business Services Groups; Inc itself. Doctors would sign contracts with us to learn our privileged and specialized method of billing, once they see a drastic upwards of collections they will change pay to address to them selves and copy our methods of billing. We have experienced this conduct over and over again in the recent years.
NEED FOR GOVERNMENTAL APPROVAL AND THE EFFECTS OF REGULATIONS
 
Medical business services are subject to the compliance requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPPA") and the billing guidelines of the Health Care Financing Administration ("HCFA"). As a result, Medical Billing and AutoMed are subject to government regulation and government approval.
RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS
 
The “Registrant” has spent over $50,000 of resource or time during the last two years on research and development.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
The Company had more than 25 employees and 5 consultants during the first half of 2007 and then the number of employees were reduced to 11 during the third Quarter and then to 5 at the end of 4 th quarter of 2007. As of filing this report on November 2, 2008 the Company had one full-time employee, Ms. Chandana Basu and one part time employee in Texas.
