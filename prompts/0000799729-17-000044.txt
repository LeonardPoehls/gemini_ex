On June 19, 2017, PAREXEL entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger pursuant to which West Street Merger Sub, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of West Street Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (which we refer to as Parent) and affiliate of Pamplona Capital Management, LLP, will be merged with and into us, with PAREXEL surviving as a subsidiary of West Street Parent, LLC, which we refer to as the merger will acquire all of the outstanding shares of PAREXEL for $88.10 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $5.5 billion, including PAREXEL’s net debt. Consummation of the merger is subject to various customary conditions, including adoption of the merger agreement by the Company’s stockholders and receipt of required regulatory approvals, the closing is expected to be completed late in the third or early in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2017. 
Immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the closing of the merger, each outstanding Company stock option, restricted stock unit, restricted share and performance restricted stock unit (collectively, the “Company Equity Awards”) will vest in full (in the case of performance restricted stock units, at target level regardless of the actual achievement of the applicable performance metric). Such fully vested Company Equity Awards will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $88.10 per share for each share of our common stock underlying such Company Equity Awards (net of any applicable exercise price and subject to any applicable withholding taxes).
On August 15, 2017, the Company announced a special meeting of the shareholders of PAREXEL to be held on September 15, 2017. At the shareholder meeting, shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 19, 2017, by and among PAREXEL, West Street Parent, LLC (“Parent”) and West Street Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub, providing for the acquisition of the Company by an affiliate of the private equity investment firm Pamplona. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the acquisition will occur by means of a merger of Merger Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent in accordance with the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act (the “MBCA”).

Our services complement the research and development (“R&D”) and marketing functions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, diagnostics, and medical device companies. Through our clinical research and product launch and commercialization services, we seek to help clients maximize the return on their significant investments in research and development by reducing the time, risk, and cost of clinical development and launch of new therapies. For large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, outsourcing these services to us provides those companies with a high-quality, variable cost alternative to the fixed costs associated with internal drug development. In addition, these large companies can benefit from our technical resource pool, broad therapeutic area expertise, other advisory services, and global infrastructure, all of which are designed to expedite parallel, multi-country clinical trials and accelerate time-to-market. For smaller bio-pharma companies, we provide access to expertise and a virtual and global network that enables these companies to develop their new products. Our vision is to strive to be the premier provider to the biopharmaceutical and medical device industries for the development and commercialization of new medical therapies worldwide. Our goal is to provide significant benefits to sponsor clients through this strategy, namely, a faster and less expensive development and launch process, as well as a clinical development strategy and expertise that support the marketing strategy for new medical products. We believe that the outsourcing of these services has increased in the past and should continue to increase 
1

in the future because of several factors, which are placing increased pressure on clients. These factors include the need to more tightly manage costs, capacity limitations, expirations of drug patent exclusivity periods, the desire to speed up patient recruitment and reduce development time, increased globalization of clinical trials, productivity issues, more stringent government regulations, and pricing pressure. With increased levels of investment continuing to be required, we believe these trends will continue to create opportunities for companies like us that are focused on improving the efficiency of the bio-pharma product development and commercialization processes. Moreover, many of our clients are reassessing how they conduct their R&D activities and are now engaging in outsourcing at a more strategic level. One consequence of this reassessment is higher concentrations of their outsourced clinical development activities with a smaller number of providers. We have been successful in winning many strategic partnerships. We believe that our broad range of offerings, our global presence, our information technology solutions, and our expertise in clinical drug development position us well to continue to participate in these strategic partnerships.
We are one of the largest biopharmaceutical services companies in the world, based upon annual service revenue. Headquartered near Boston, Massachusetts, we have offices in 85 locations and have approximately 18,900 employees throughout 52 countries around the world.

In addition, PI's portfolio of services is increasingly being embedded with that of CRS to provide our clients with a more integrated service offering.
The revenue generated by each of our business segments for each of the last three fiscal years is described below under the heading for each segment. The gross profit of each segment for each of the last three fiscal years is described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. We have a global infrastructure supporting our business segments and, therefore, assets are not identified by reportable segment.
CLINICAL RESEARCH SERVICES (CRS)
Our CRS business segment generated service revenue of $1,626.6 million, or 76.8% of our consolidated service revenue in Fiscal Year 2017, service revenue of $1,626.0 million, or 77.6% of our consolidated service revenue in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 (“Fiscal Year 2016”), and service revenue of $1,599.1 million, or 79.4% of our consolidated service revenue in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 (“Fiscal Year 2015”).
CRS offers complete services for the design, initiation, and management of clinical trial programs, a critical element in obtaining regulatory approval for biopharmaceutical products. We have performed services in connection with clinical trials in most therapeutic areas, including Oncology, Cardiology, Infectious Diseases, Neurology, Allergy/Immunology, Endocrinology/Metabolism, Gastroenterology, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Orthopedics, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Pulmonology, Rheumatology, Dermatology, Genitourinary, Ophthalmology, and Transplantation. Our multi-disciplinary clinical trials group examines a product’s existing preclinical and clinical data to design clinical trials to provide evidence of the product’s safety and efficacy.
CRS can manage many aspects of clinical trials including project management, study protocol design, Case Report Form (“CRF”) design, site and investigator recruitment, patient enrollment, study monitoring and data collection, data management, biostatistics and programming, report writing, medical services, and clinical logistics.
Clinical trials and observational studies are monitored and conducted by CRS in adherence with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) and Good Pharmacoepidemiological Practice (“GPP”), respectively. The design of efficient CRFs, detailed operations manuals, and site monitoring by our clinical research associates is undertaken to ensure that clinical investigators and their staff follow established study protocols. We have adopted standard operating procedures (“SOPs”) that are intended to satisfy regulatory requirements and serve as a tool for controlling and enhancing the quality of our worldwide clinical services.
Clinical trials represent one of the most expensive and time-consuming parts of the overall biopharmaceutical product development process. The information generated during these trials is critical to gaining marketing approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”), the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”), and other comparable regulatory agencies around the world. The data may also be used to gain market acceptance by clinicians, patients, and third-party payers. CRS clinical trial management services involve many phases of clinical trials, including Phases I, II, III, and IV. See “Government Regulations” below for additional information regarding processes involved in clinical trials.
Early Phase – The Early Phase business unit of CRS encompasses the early stages of clinical testing, when a product is first evaluated in humans to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. These tests vary from “first-in-man” to “dose-ranging” to “proof of concept” studies in Phases I and IIa of development. The Early Phase business unit of CRS offers clients a one-stop service where studies are performed in healthy volunteers as well as in patients from various disease populations. The support services include project and program management, drug development consulting, medical writing, handling of investigational products, data management, and biostatistical and bioanalytical services. Our international network of Clinical Pharmacology Units are located in Berlin, Germany; Baltimore, Maryland (U.S.); Glendale, California (U.S.); Bloemfontein, 
3

South Africa; and Harrow, U.K. Our network also includes a bioanalytical laboratory in Bloemfontein, which performs drug analyses in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), a system of managed controls for laboratory and research organizations to ensure the consistency and reliability of results. With these locations, the Early Phase business unit offers clinical pharmacology services (including bioanalytical services) on three continents. In addition to the PAREXEL Clinical Pharmacology Units, our Early Product Development (EPD) service is mainly focused on proof-of-concept studies conducted at sites around the globe.
Phase II-III – The Phase II-III business unit of CRS encompasses the later stages of clinical testing. CRS assists clients with one or more of the aspects of clinical trials and observational studies described below. CRS performs both full-service and single- or multi-service projects. We support our clients on a full service and functional basis. As a result, our involvement may range from participating in just one aspect of a clinical trial or observational study to participating in all aspects. These services include the following, the majority of which are also provided by our Early Phase business unit:

• | Study Protocol Design – The protocol defines, among other things, the medical issues a study seeks to examine and the statistical tests that will be conducted. Accordingly, the protocol specifies the frequency and type of laboratory and clinical measures that are to be tracked and analyzed, the number of patients required to produce a statistically valid result, the period of time over which such patients must be tracked and the frequency and dosage of drug administration.


• | CRF Design – Once the study protocol has been finalized, a paper or electronic CRF must be developed. The CRF is the critical document for collecting the necessary clinical data as dictated by the study protocol. It may change at different stages of a trial.


• | Site and Investigator Recruitment – The product under investigation is administered to patients usually by third-party physicians, serving as independent contractors (referred to as investigators) at hospitals, clinics, or other locations, referred to as clinical sites. Medical devices are implemented or tested by investigators in similar settings. Potential investigators may be identified and solicited by the product sponsor. A significant portion of a trial’s success depends on the identification and recruitment of experienced investigators with an adequate base of patients who satisfy the requirements of the study protocol. We have access to thousands of investigators who have conducted clinical trials for us. We provide additional services at the clinical site to assist physicians and expedite the clinical research process.


• | Patient Enrollment – The investigators, usually with our assistance, find and enroll patients suitable for the study. The speed with which trials can be completed is significantly affected by the rate at which patients are enrolled. Prospective patients are required to review information about the clinical trial and the investigational product and its possible side effects, and they sign an informed consent form to record their knowledge and acceptance of potential side effects. Patients also undergo a medical examination to determine whether they meet the requirements of the study protocol. Patients then receive the product under investigation or a control (for example, a placebo) and are examined by the investigator as specified by the study protocol. Investigators are responsible for administering the products to patients, as well as examining patients and conducting necessary tests.


• | Study Monitoring and Data Collection – As patients are examined and tests are conducted in accordance with the study protocol and applicable regulatory requirements, data are recorded on CRFs, either electronically or paper-based. CRFs are transmitted electronically from study sites or collected by specially trained persons known as clinical monitors. To ensure that the CRFs are completed correctly and the study has been conducted in compliance with the protocol and regulatory requirements, we manage the sites closely over the telephone/internet and through monitoring visits as needed. We offer several EDC technologies, which significantly enhance both the quality and timeliness of clinical data capture and collection while achieving significant efficiency savings. Our study monitoring and data collection services are designed to comply with the adverse events reporting guidelines and related regulatory requirements of the FDA and other relevant regulatory agencies. 


• | Data Management – Our data management professionals provide a broad array of services to support the accurate collection, organization, validation, and analysis of clinical data. For instance, they assist in the design of CRFs and investigator training manuals to ensure that data are collected in an organized and consistent format in compliance with the study protocol and applicable regulatory requirements. Databases are designed according to the analytical specifications of the project and the particular needs of the client. The use of EDC technologies to gather and report clinical data and the use of scanning and imaging of the CRFs expedites data exchange while minimizing data collection errors by permitting the verification of data integrity in a more timely manner. After the data is entered, the data management team performs an array of services, including data abstraction, data review, medical coding, serious adverse event reconciliations, loading of electronic data (such as laboratory data), database verification, and editing and resolution of data problems. The data is then submitted in a format prescribed by the client. Our CRS business segment has extensive experience throughout the world in the creation of scientific databases for all phases of the drug development process, including the creation of customized databases to meet client-specific formats, integrated databases to support New Drug

4

Application (“NDA”) and equivalent submissions and databases created and maintained in compliance with FDA, European, Asian, and other regulatory specifications and requirements.

• | Biostatistics and Programming – Our biostatistics professionals assist clients with all phases of drug development, including biostatistical consulting, database design, data analysis, and statistical reporting. These professionals develop and review protocols, design appropriate analysis plans, and design report formats to address the objectives of the study protocol as well as the client’s individual objectives. Working with programming staff, biostatisticians/epidemiologists perform appropriate analysis and produce tables, graphs, listings, and other applicable displays of results according to an analysis plan. Our biostatisticians/epidemiologists may also represent clients during panel hearings at the FDA and other regulatory agencies.


• | Report Writing – A description of the study conducted and the statistical analysis of data collected during the trial and other clinical data are presented and summarized in a final report generated for inclusion in a regulatory document.


• | Medical Services – Throughout the course of a development program, our physicians provide a wide range of medical research and consulting services to improve the efficiency and quality of clinical research, including medical supervision of clinical trials, medical monitoring of patient safety, review and reporting of adverse events, medical writing, and strategy and product development. Our medical services professionals also provide lifecycle drug safety services combining operational pharmacovigilance and pharmacovigilance consulting. Operational pharmacovigilance capabilities and pharmacovigilance consulting cover all phases of clinical development and drug safety for marketed products.


• | Project Management – Throughout the entire spectrum of activities described above, our CRS segment provides project management services. These services entail providing overall leadership to our project team, acting as the main client liaison, project planning, managing progress against study goals and deliverables, budget management, progress and metrics reporting, and issue resolution. These project management services are offered on all types of studies – single-service, multi-service, or full-service.

Our systems also enable us to respond quickly to client inquiries regarding progress on projects and, in some cases, to gain direct access to client data on client owned systems.
SALES AND MARKETING
Our sales and marketing personnel carry out our global business development activities. In addition to significant selling experience, most of these individuals have technical and/or scientific backgrounds. Our senior executives and project team leaders also participate in maintaining key client relationships and engaging in business development activities.
Each of our three reporting segments has a business development team that focuses on its particular market segment. In many cases, however, the reporting segment selling teams work together in order to provide clients with the most appropriate service offering to meet their needs. Moreover, we have developed strategic account management teams to provide clients with a single point of contact and to facilitate cross-selling opportunities.
Each business development employee is responsible for a specific client segment or group of clients and for strengthening and expanding an effective relationship with that client. Each individual is responsible for developing his or her client base on our behalf, responding to client requests for information, developing and defending proposals, and making presentations to clients.
Our business development group is supported by our marketing team. Our marketing activities consist primarily of market information development and analysis, strategic planning, competitive analysis, brand management, collateral development, participation in industry conferences, advertising, e-marketing, publications, and website development and maintenance. The marketing team focuses both on supporting the individual business development teams for their specific market segments as well as promoting an integrated marketing strategy and communications plan for PAREXEL as a whole.
CLIENTS
We have derived in the past, and may derive in the future, a significant portion of our service revenue from both an individual client and a core group of clients. Concentrations of business in the biopharmaceutical services industry are common and we expect to continue to experience such concentration in future years due to our increasing number of strategic partnerships. Our five largest clients accounted for 37%, 40% and 44% of our consolidated service revenue in the aggregate for Fiscal Year 2017, Fiscal Year 2016, and Fiscal Year 2015, respectively. For Fiscal Year 2017, Fiscal Year 2016, and Fiscal Year 2015, one client, Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”) individually accounted for 12%, 13% and 14% of our consolidated service revenue, respectively.

BACKLOG
During Fiscal Year 2017, PAREXEL started reporting backlog based on executed contract awards, in line with emerging practice in our industry. Like other industry leaders, we are moving away from prior industry practice of including pre-contract awards in net new business and backlog. We will continue to track pre-contract written awards internally, as we believe a substantial portion will result in contracts, be added to backlog, and generate revenue. Backlog at June 30, 2017 was approximately $3.97 billion, compared with approximately $4.57 billion at June 30, 2016 calculated on a consistent method, a decrease of 13.1%. Subject to the matters addressed in the following paragraph, we anticipate that approximately $1.6 billion of the backlog will be recognized as revenue in our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 (“Fiscal Year 2018”). 
We believe that our backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful predictor of future results. Projects included in backlog are subject to cancellation, revision, or delay. As detailed more fully in the “Risk Factors” section of this annual report, clients terminate, delay, or change the scope of projects for a variety of reasons including, among others, the failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements, unexpected or undesirable clinical results of the product, client decisions to forego a particular study, insufficient patient enrollment or investigator recruitment, or production problems resulting in shortages of the drug. Additionally, our backlog dynamic may be impacted by our strategic partnerships, which generally represent our largest customers. As a result, any delay or cancellation related to these partnerships could significantly impact the conversion of backlog into revenue. Generally, our contracts can be terminated at any time upon thirty to one hundred twenty days' notice by the client. 
COMPETITION
We compete with other biopharmaceutical outsourcing services companies and other clinical research organizations (“CROs”) that provide one or more of the services currently being offered by us. Some of the large biopharmaceutical services companies, such as QuintilesIMS, Laboratory Corporation of America, Pharmaceutical Product Development Inc., INC Research/inVentiv Health, PRA Health Sciences, Inc. and Icon plc, offer services that compete directly with our services at many levels.
We believe that the synergies arising from integrating the products and services offered by our different business units, coupled with our global infrastructure (and resulting rapid access to diverse patient populations and markets), technology products and services, and depth of expertise and experience differentiate us from our competitors. Although there are no guarantees that we will continue to do so, we believe that we compete favorably in all of our business areas and segments, as more fully described below.
CRS
The clinical outsourcing services industry is very fragmented, with several hundred providers offering varying levels of service, skills, and capabilities. Our CRS group primarily competes against in-house departments of pharmaceutical companies, other full service biopharmaceutical outsourcing services companies, small specialty CROs, and to a small extent, universities, teaching hospitals, and other site organizations. The primary competitors for our CRS business include QuintilesIMS, Laboratory Corporation of America, Pharmaceutical Product Development Inc., and Icon plc.
CRS generally competes on the basis of:

• | a broad international presence with strategically located facilities and access to end markets;


• | the ability to organize and manage large-scale clinical trials on a global basis;


• | the ability to recruit investigators and patients expeditiously;


• | medical and scientific expertise in a specific therapeutic area;


• | quality of services;


• | breadth of services;


• | the ability to integrate information technology with systems to improve the efficiency of clinical research;


• | previous experience with a client or a specific therapeutic area;


• | the ability to manage large and complex medical databases;


• | the ability to provide statistical and regulatory services;


• | financial strength and stability; and


• | price.

We believe that the key competitive strengths of our CRS business are its global footprint and related rapid access to diverse patient populations, therapeutic expertise, technological expertise, commercialization expertise and its experience in global drug development.

PC
Our PC segment competes with a large and diverse group of specialty service providers, including major consulting firms with pharmaceutical industry practices, large and small biopharmaceutical services companies, individual consultants, specialty medical communications services companies, and medical communication subsidiaries of large international advertising companies.
We believe that a key differentiator of our PC service offering is our combination of scientific and regulatory expertise. We consider PC’s key competitive strengths to include a combination of deep global expertise in early and late stage drug development, regulatory strategy and submissions and GMP compliance. We believe that this broad range of capabilities enables us to help our clients achieve their regulatory and marketing objectives. 
Our Health Advances business is a strategy consulting group that focuses exclusively on the healthcare industry. Health Advances helps clients realize growth opportunities worldwide for healthcare technologies, products and services. Health Advances consultants partner with senior executives and investors on their highest-stakes strategic decisions. As a result of deep knowledge of the complexities of the healthcare sector, they provide clients with innovative perspectives and actionable insights that help them make more confident strategic business decisions that capitalize on their company’s growth potential.
PI
Our PI business competes primarily with biopharmaceutical services companies, information technology companies, and software companies. Companies in this segment compete based on the strength and usability of their technology offerings, their expertise and experience, and their understanding of the clinical development process. PI’s key competitive strength is its combination of technological expertise and knowledge of clinical development. Additionally, PI’s offerings and CRS services provide substantial synergies to our customers.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our trademark “PAREXEL®” is of material importance to us. This and other trademarks have been registered in the United States and many foreign countries. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks generally may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and as long as they have not been found to have become generic.
EMPLOYEES
As of June 30, 2017, we had approximately 18,900 full-time equivalent employees. Approximately 26% of our employees are located in the United States and approximately 74% are located internationally. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
The success of our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified professional, scientific, and technical staff. The level of competition among employers in the U.S. and overseas for skilled personnel, particularly those with Ph.D., M.D., or equivalent degrees, is high. We believe that our position as one of the recognized leaders in our industry and, in particular, the breadth-and-depth of our expertise are advantages in attracting qualified candidates. In addition, we believe that the wide range of clinical trials in which we participate allows us to offer broad experience to clinical researchers.
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
We provide clinical trial services and diverse consulting solutions to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries worldwide. Lack of success in obtaining approval for the conduct of clinical trials in the countries in which we manage clinical trials on behalf of our clients can adversely affect us. We make no guarantees to our clients with regard to successful outcomes of the regulatory process, including the success of clinical trial applications or marketing authorization applications.
The clinical research services we provided in the U.S. are subject to established and evolving FDA regulations. We are obligated to comply with FDA requirements governing activities such as obtaining Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approval and patient informed consents, verifying qualifications of investigators, reporting patients’ adverse reactions to products, and maintaining thorough and accurate records. We are also required to ensure that the computer systems we use to process human data from clinical trials are validated in accordance with the FDA’s electronic records regulations, 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 11, which apply to the pharmaceutical and CRO industries when companies choose to use electronic records in lieu of paper records or electronic signatures in lieu of traditional signatures. We must maintain source documents for each trial for specified periods, and such documents may be reviewed according to GCP or GPP standards by the study sponsors and the FDA and other regulatory agencies (for example the EMA and the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency) during audits and inspections. Non-compliance with GCP or GPP can result in the disqualification of data collected during a clinical study and in non-approval or non-clearance of a product application submitted to the FDA or other regulatory agencies around the world.
The clinical investigation of new drugs, biologics, and medical devices is highly regulated by government agencies around the world. The standard for the conduct of clinical research and development studies is embodied in GCP, a set of international standards and guidelines, which stipulate procedures designed to ensure the quality and integrity of data obtained from clinical testing, and 
10

to protect the rights and safety of clinical trial participants. The FDA and many other regulatory authorities require that study results submitted to such authorities be based on studies conducted in compliance with GCP. The European Union (“EU”) enacted the Clinical Trials Directive (the “Directive”) in 2004 in attempt to harmonize the requirements of the members of the EU regarding the conduct of clinical trials. The EU released in April 2014 a new legislation to repeal the Directive in a stepwise approach between mid-2016 and 2019 to increase the attractiveness for the conduct of clinical trials in its territory by reducing the bureaucratic burden. The regulation will not require adoption by each member country thus ensuring greater harmonization. The Directive requires sponsors of clinical trials to submit formal applications to national ethics committees and regulatory authorities prior to the initiation of clinical trials in any of the 28 Member States of the EU, and the new legislation will require submission through a portal at the EMA. The regulatory landscape in Asia and Latin America is heterogeneous, with each country independently enforcing its unique regulatory policies. This has improved with more cooperation between countries and a deeper awareness of regional and global differences in regulatory policies and practice, especially in Asia. As in the United States, clinical trials in the EU are expected to be carried out in compliance with detailed requirements for GCP. The revised ICH GCP E6 R2 guideline, strengthening especially risk management and oversight, is being implemented progressively (came into effect in June 2017 in the European Union). PAREXEL maintains an agile Quality Management System that anticipated the changes that would be required by the revised guideline and preemptively adjusted. As a result minimal changes to existing processes were required. The international regulatory approval process, in the EU as well as many other countries, includes all of the risks and potential delays associated with the FDA approval process.
Because the FDA’s regulatory requirements have served as the model for much of the regulation of new drug development worldwide, regulatory requirements similar to those of the FDA exist in the other countries in which we operate. Our regulatory capabilities include knowledge of the specific regulatory requirements of numerous countries. For more than ten years, we have managed successful regulatory submissions for life science companies around the world. Beginning in 1990, the FDA and corresponding regulatory agencies of the EU and Japan commenced discussions to develop harmonized standards for preclinical and clinical studies and the format and content of applications for new drug approvals through a process known as the International Conference on Harmonisation (“ICH”) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. Data from multinational studies adhering to GCP are now generally acceptable to the FDA and regulators in Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan and Latin American countries, although there can be no advance assurance that the submission of such data to any regulatory authority will result in regulatory approval for marketing of the product. The ICH process has sanctioned a single common format for drug and biologic marketing authorization applications, known as the Common Technical Document (“CTD”) in the U.S., Europe, Japan and Canada. On July 1, 2003 the CTD format became mandatory in Europe and Japan and highly recommended by the FDA in the United States and by the Canadian regulatory authorities. We have developed the expertise to prepare CTDs for our clients in both paper and electronic form.
REGULATION OF DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS
Before a new drug or biologic may be approved and marketed, the drug or biologic must undergo extensive testing and regulatory review in order to determine that the drug or biologic is safe and effective. It is not possible to estimate the time in which preclinical and Phase I, II and III studies will be completed with respect to a given product, although the time period may last many years. Using the U.S. regulatory environment as an example, the stages of this development process are generally as follows:
Preclinical Research (approximately 1 to 3.5 years) – In vitro (“test tube”) and animal studies must be conducted in accordance with GLP to establish the relative toxicity of the drug or biologic over a wide range of doses and to detect any potential to cause a variety of adverse conditions or diseases, including birth defects or cancer. If results warrant continuing development of the drug or biologic, the results of the studies are submitted to the FDA by the manufacturer as part of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”), which must be submitted to the FDA before proposed clinical testing can begin. An IND must include, among other things, preclinical data, CMC information, and an investigational plan, and must become effective before such trials may begin. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. In addition, clinical trials cannot begin at a particular study site until approved by the site's IRB, which is an independent expert body charged with protecting patient safety and privacy. As a result, there can be no assurance that submission of an IND will result in the ability to commence clinical trials.
Clinical Trials (approximately 3.5 to 6 years)
Phase I consists of basic safety and pharmacology testing in approximately 20 to 80 human subjects, usually healthy volunteers or stable patients, and includes studies to evaluate the metabolic and pharmacologic action of the product in humans, how the drug or biologic works, how it is affected by other drugs, how it is tolerated and absorbed, where it goes in the body, how long it remains active, and how it is broken down and eliminated from the body.
Phase II includes basic efficacy (effectiveness) and dose-range testing in a limited patient population (usually 100 to 200 patients) afflicted with a specific disease or condition for which the product is intended for use, further safety testing, evaluation of 
11

effectiveness, and determination of optimal dose levels, dose schedules, and routes of administration. If Phase II studies yield satisfactory results and no hold is placed on further studies by the FDA, Phase III studies can commence.
Phase III includes larger scale, multi-center, comparative clinical trials conducted with patients afflicted by a target disease, in order to provide enough data for a valid statistical test of safety and efficacy required by the FDA and others, and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
The FDA receives reports on the progress of each phase of clinical testing and may require the modification, suspension, or termination of clinical trials if, among other things, an unreasonable risk is presented to patients or if the design of the trial is insufficient to meet its stated objective. In addition, information about certain clinical trials must be submitted to, and made available to the public on, the government website www.clinicaltrials.gov. 
NDA or Biologic License Application (“BLA”) Preparation and Submission – Upon completion of Phase III trials, the sponsor assembles the statistically analyzed data from all phases of development, along with the chemistry and manufacturing and pre-clinical data and the proposed labeling, among other things, into a single large document, the NDA or BLA in CTD format as of July 1, 2003, which today comprises, on average, roughly 100,000 pages. Typically, an NDA or BLA must be accompanied by payment of a statutory fee.
FDA Review of NDA or BLA – The FDA carefully scrutinizes data from all phases of development to confirm that the manufacturer has complied with regulations and that the drug or biologic is safe and effective for the specific use (or “indication”) under study. The FDA may refuse to accept the NDA or BLA for filing and substantive review if certain administrative and content criteria are not satisfied. Even after accepting the submission for review, the FDA may also require additional testing or information before approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA must deny approval of an NDA or BLA if applicable regulatory requirements are not satisfied.
Post-Marketing Surveillance and Phase IV Studies – Regulatory authorities require companies to collect and periodically report additional safety and, where appropriate, benefit data on the drug or biologic for as long as the manufacturer markets the product. The FDA and other major regulatory agencies require sponsor companies to prepare risk management plans as part of their approval requirements for marketed drugs and biologics, aimed at monitoring areas of drug risk and implementing plans for minimizing their occurrence. In addition, global agencies may impose additional post-marketing study requirements as a condition of a product’s approval to confirm the safety profile or verify clinical benefit in the “real-world” clinical setting or after a product's approval if safety issues are identified. Regulated post marketing surveillance studies are imposed by a number of national agencies for all new products launched into their market and the data used to re-evaluate the continuation of the product license. Product approval may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if a significant safety issue is identified that brings into question the clinical benefit relative to the emerging risks. 
REGULATION OF MEDICAL DEVICES
Unless a medical device is exempted from pre-market approval or clearance requirements, which are described below, or is eligible for de novo review, FDA approval or clearance of the device is required before the product may be marketed in the United States. In order to obtain pre-market clearance for marketing, a manufacturer must demonstrate substantial equivalence to a similar legally marketed product by submitting a pre-market notification, or 510(k), to the FDA. The FDA may require preclinical and clinical data to support a substantial equivalence determination, and there can be no assurance the FDA will find a device substantially equivalent. Clinical trials can take extended periods of time to complete. In addition, if the FDA requires an approved Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) before clinical device trials may commence, there can be no guarantee that the agency will approve the IDE. The IDE approval process could also result in significant delays.
After submission of a pre-market notification containing, among other things, any data collected, the FDA may find the device substantially equivalent and the device may be marketed. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require approval of a pre-market approval application (“PMA”). If the FDA finds that a device is not substantially equivalent, the manufacturer may request that the FDA make a risk-based classification to place the device in Class I or Class II. However, if a timely request for risk-based classification is not made, or if the FDA determines that a Class III designation is appropriate, a PMA will be required before the device may be marketed.
If there is no legally marketed predicate device, a manufacturer can seek to have a device classified into Class I or Class II through the de novo review process. As a result of statutory revisions made in 2012, the de novo process can be used without first going through the 510(k) process.
The PMA approval process is lengthy, expensive, and typically requires, among other things, extensive data from preclinical testing and a well-controlled clinical trial or trials that demonstrate a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. There can be no assurance that review will result in timely, or any, PMA approval. There may also be significant conditions associated with the approval, including limitations on labeling and advertising claims and the imposition of post-market testing, tracking, or surveillance requirements. Even after approval, a new PMA or PMA supplement is required in the event of a modification to the device, its 
12

labeling or its manufacturing process. Typically, a PMA or 510(k) must be accompanied by payment of a statutory fee. In addition, information about certain clinical trials must be submitted to the government website www.clinicaltrials.gov, where it may be made publicly available. 
REGULATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION
The confidentiality, security, use and disclosure of patient-specific information are subject to governmental regulation. Regulations to protect the safety and privacy of human subjects who participate in or whose data are used in clinical research generally require clinical investigators to obtain legally effective informed consent from identifiable research subjects before research is undertaken. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economics and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act of 2009, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued regulations mandating privacy and data security standards and breach notification requirements for certain types of individually identifiable health information, or protected health information, when used or disclosed by health care providers and other HIPAA-covered entities or business associates that provide services to or perform functions on behalf of these covered entities. HIPAA regulations generally require individuals’ written authorization before identifiable health information may be used for research, in addition to any required informed consent. HIPAA regulations also specify standards for de-identifying health information so that information can be handled outside of the HIPAA requirements and for creating limited data sets that can be used for research purposes under less stringent HIPAA restrictions.
Outside of the United States, many countries have enacted laws to safeguard the privacy and security of personal information, including individually identifiable health information. The member states of the European Union have adopted a rigorous system of data protection regulations, based upon a framework imposed by the 1995 European Commission Directive on Data Protection. These rules provide broad protections for personal information, including, among other things, notice requirements, limits on the scope and duration for which personal information may be maintained and processed, restrictions on disclosures of personal information, standards for providing individuals with control over the manner in which personal information is processed, and restrictions on transfers of such data to the United States and other countries that the European Union finds to lack “adequate” data protection laws of their own. Health-related information is recognized as a special, sensitive category of personal information, which may generally be processed only pursuant to the affirmative, or opt-in, consent of the individual to whom the information pertains. Violations of these data protection regulations are subject to administrative penalties, civil money penalties, and criminal prosecution, including corporate fines and personal liability.
In order to comply with these laws and regulations, we must maintain internal compliance policies and procedures, and we may need to implement new privacy and security measures, which may require us to make substantial expenditures or cause us to limit the products and services we offer. In addition, if we violate applicable laws, regulations, contractual commitments, or other duties relating to the use, privacy or security of health information, we could be subject to civil liability or criminal penalties and it may be necessary to modify our business practices.
REGULATION OF HEALTH INDUSTRY ARRANGEMENTS
Since the United States Medicare program will pay for certain costs of qualifying clinical drug trials, as well as certain reasonable and necessary items and services used to diagnose and treat complications arising from participation in clinical trials, the conduct of such trials may be subject to laws and regulations that are intended to prevent misuse of such government health care program funding. In the U.S., these laws include, among others, the False Claims Act, which prohibits submitting or causing the submission of false statements or improper claims for government health care program payments; the so-called Stark physician self-referral law, which prohibits physicians from referring or billing for certain designated health services performed or provided by an entity from which the physician or an immediate family member receives financial compensation, or in which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial compensation, investment, or ownership interest; and the health care anti-kickback law, which prohibits paying, offering to pay, or receiving payment in exchange for the referral of services or devices that are covered under a federal health care program, and which therefore restrict the permissibility of financial and promotional arrangements with patients, physicians, investigators, and study sites, such as, for example, financial incentives for physicians to enroll study participants or for patients, investigators or study sites to participate in a trial. Violations of these restrictions are subject to potentially severe administrative, civil and criminal penalties that could have a substantial and material adverse effect on our business, our reputation, and our continued ability to offer our biopharmaceutical outsourcing services. 
POTENTIAL LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE
Our clinical research services focus on the testing of experimental drugs and devices on human volunteers pursuant to study protocols and in accordance with laws and regulations which govern clinical trials. Clinical research involves a risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients due to, among other reasons, possible unforeseen adverse side effects or improper administration of the new drug or medical device. We do not generally provide health care services directly to patients. Rather, our physicians or third party physician investigators are responsible for administering drugs and evaluating the study patients. Many of the patients enrolled in clinical trials are already seriously ill and are at risk of further illness or death.
13

We believe that the risk of liability to patients in clinical trials is mitigated by various regulatory requirements, including the role of IRBs, the need to obtain each patient’s informed consent, and the oversight by applicable regulatory authorities. The FDA, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom, and regulatory authorities in other countries require each human clinical trial to be reviewed and approved by the IRB at each study site. An IRB is an independent ethics committee that includes both medical and non-medical personnel and is obligated to protect the interests of patients enrolled in the trial. The IRB approves and monitors the protocol and the measures designed to protect patients, such as the requirement to obtain informed consents.
To reduce our potential liability, we generally seek to incorporate indemnity provisions into our contracts with clients to protect us from liability for adverse reactions to the study drug as well as any negligent acts by the study sponsor and/or third party physician investigators. These indemnity provisions do not, however, protect us against certain of our own actions, such as those involving negligence. Moreover, these indemnities are contractual arrangements that are subject to negotiation with individual clients, and the terms and scope of such indemnities can vary from client to client and from study to study. Finally, the financial performance of these indemnities is not secured; therefore we bear the risk that an indemnifying party may not have the financial ability to fulfill its indemnification obligations. We could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with an uninsured claim that is outside the scope of an indemnity or where an indemnification obligation, although applicable, is not performed in accordance with its terms.
We currently maintain a portfolio of insurance coverage, including a professional liability insurance policy, subject to deductibles and coverage limits. There can be no assurance that this insurance coverage will be adequate, or that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
