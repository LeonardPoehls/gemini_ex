 OVERVIEW
  
 Paybox Corp, originally named Unique Ventures, Inc., (hereinafter referred to at times as “Paybox”, “our”, “we”, or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 27, 1987. We consummated our initial public offering in 1992. In May 1990, we changed our name to Computer Concepts, Inc. and in August 2000, we changed our name to Direct Insite Corp. In September 2016, we changed our name to Paybox Corp to align the corporate name and brand with the Company’s globally deployed Working Capital Management Platform, PAYBOX®.
Our Business
  
 Paybox operates as a software as a service provider (“SaaS”) that provides a powerful unified working capital management platform for Order-to-Cash and Procure-to-Pay processes that facilitate over $160 billion worth of transactions annually between more than 375,000 companies worldwide.
  
 The flagship component of Paybox’s unified working capital management platform is PAYBOX®, an Order-to-Cash process that provides an innovative receivables automation solution which combines electronic invoicing, online approvals and adjustments, Payment Card Industry (“PCI”)-compliant electronic payments, and integration with any legacy accounting, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) or lockbox system. PAYBOX is sold both through banks to corporate users of their treasury management and lockbox services, and directly to corporations. Banks and corporations use PAYBOX to reduce Days Sales’ Outstanding, lower costs, and improve straight-through accounts receivables (“AR”) posting.
  
 Paybox’s unified working capital management platform also provides a powerful component that transforms Procure-to-Pay processes. The component delivers end-to-end capabilities for supplier registration, invoice capture, electronic invoicing, workflow, electronic payments, discount management, spend management, and business intelligence. The platform is uniquely suited for financial shared services environments.
  
 Paybox’s clients include IBM, Siemens, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services, Saint Gobain, Carlson Wagonlit Travel, and one of the world’s largest financial institutions.

 Our revenue comes from (i) recurring, on-going services that are billed monthly; and (ii) non-recurring, professional services derived from the configuration of our software platform.
  
 HP Enterprise Services (“HPE”) accounted for approximately 21.5%, 33% and 38% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had one principal contract remaining with HPE providing e-invoice services, which contract expires in June 2018. The contracts may be terminated by either party on ninety days’ advance written notice. As disclosed in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 23, 2015 and February 19, 2016, we were notified by HPE that one of its clients, representing approximately 3.0% and 14.7% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, was terminating its contract with HPE effective February 23, 2016. Despite efforts to negotiate a direct contractual agreement with this client, the client ultimately decided to terminate its use of our services, and accordingly, the Company has not recorded revenue from this client after February 2016. We were further notified by HPE in August 2016 that another of its clients, representing 4.5% and 6.3% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, was terminating its contract with HPE effective August 15, 2016, and accordingly, the Company has not recorded revenue from this client after August 2016.
  
 International Business Machines, Inc. (“IBM”), representing approximately 42.5%, 37.3% and 38.1% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, utilizes our suite of services to allow its customers from around the globe to receive, analyze, dispute and cost allocate all of their invoice data in their local language and currency via the internet. We have two principal contracts with IBM to provide e-invoice services for substantially all of IBM’s operating units. Both of these contracts were extended for a one-year period, through December 31, 2017, and are renewable annually thereafter. The contracts may be terminated by either party with one hundred eighty days’ advance written notice. As noted in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 3, 2017, we were notified by IBM that one of these contracts will be terminated on September 1, 2017. Approximately 35.1% and 31.3% of the Company’s revenues were attributable to this agreement with IBM in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. It is possible that the Company may continue to provide certain services relating to this agreement on a month-to-month basis following termination, but there can be no assurances that the Company will continue to provide such services to this client.
  
 We have two other customers, representing approximately 24.0%, 18.1% and 13.0% combined of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These customers both utilize our accounts payable automation solution and are contracted with us through September 2019 and December 2019, respectively
  
  PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
  
 Paybox provides a unified working capital management platform for Order-to-Cash and Procure-to-Pay processes.
  
  Order-to-Cash: PAYBOX®
  
 Paybox’s flagship solution is a working capital management platform, called PAYBOX. PAYBOX combines capabilities for: e-invoicing, online approvals and adjustments, electronic payments, and integration with ERP, AR, and lockbox systems.
  
 In November 2014, Paybox successfully launched PAYBOX for a global bank client. The bank is using PAYBOX to provide white-label accounts receivable automation to a leading consumer goods provider. The bank is now marketing PAYBOX to its treasury management client base.

 PAYBOX’s end-to-end approach to order-to-cash helps businesses accelerate Days Sales Outstanding (“DSO”), reduce receivables costs, improve straight-through AR posting, and increase visibility into financial information.
  
 PAYBOX is a modular, “Reverse Lockbox” solution that integrates with legacy ERP, AR, lockbox (including remote deposit capture and mobile capture solutions) or treasury systems to provide a building block for an integrated receivables strategy.
  
 PAYBOX streamlines receivables processes end-to-end by combining:
  
   ●
 Invoice Presentment: Enables billers to present invoices in any format required by payers, including electronic invoicing, invoice network integration, and print. Payers access electronic invoices via a password-protected mailbox on the PAYBOX portal.

 
   ●
 Online Adjustments & Approvals: Replicates a payer’s workflow to allow for online review, adjustment, and approval of invoices. Payers also can attach supplemental information (such as images of damaged items) for disputes, and manage credits. Billers receive real-time updates on adjusted invoices.

 
   ●
 Electronic Payments: Enables payers to control the amount they pay, the payment type, and the settlement date. Payers can upload discount schedules and set rules for how payments are made. PAYBOX is PCI-compliant and supports most payment types.

 
   ●
 Integration: Provides a remittance file for reconciliation and posting. PAYBOX is ERP-agnostic, and Paybox is an SAP-Certified Business Partner. Additionally, the PAYBOX platform was developed to coexist with legacy lockbox processing platforms.

 
   ●
 Downstream Financing: Facilitates dynamic discount and supply chain financing.

 
 Paybox rounds out its PAYBOX offering with a third-party print/mail partnership to manage the paper-to-electronic transition all firms face.
  
 PAYBOX is delivered exclusively as a SaaS offering.
  
 Although corporations can purchase PAYBOX directly from Paybox, we also sell PAYBOX through banks as a white-labeled solution. The flexibility of PAYBOX helps banks accelerate their integrated receivables strategy. A bank could, for example, use PAYBOX as an e-invoicing and electronic payments solution for commercial clients, while interfacing with wholesale lockbox to offer an integrated receivables solution later on.
  
  Procure-to Pay: e-invoice Automation for Accounts Payable
  
 Paybox’s e-invoice Management for Accounts Payable increases accounts payable productivity by streamlining and automating manual supplier invoice validation, inquiry and approval processes.
  
 Paybox’s Procure-to-Pay service is focused on providing the following significant business benefits:
  
   ●
 Eliminate manual invoice validation processes

   ●
 Improve on-time payments and the ability to capture early payment discounts

   ●
 Increase supplier e-invoice submission

   ●
 Reduce Accounts Payable call center traffic

   ●
 Enhance supplier relationships and overall ease of business

 
  Supplier Self-Service Portal
  
 Paybox’s Procure-to-Pay service offering includes a supplier self-service portal and e-invoice presentment capability that is able to reduce call center traffic by resolving inquiries without human intervention. Paybox’s online portal allows suppliers to access their invoice status, invoice line items, attachments, payment status, and other relevant billing information on their own time, at any time and without having to call or wait for support.
 Supplier Electronic Invoice Submission
  
 Suppliers are able to submit their invoices via electronic formats and/or adapters, including web form entry, supplier networks, spreadsheet upload, and ERP adapters such as Oracle, SAP, Great Plains, or legacy billing systems. Suppliers can also perform a purchase order ‘flip’ function where customer orders can be used to automatically generate preliminary bills for review and release for payment.
 Invoice Matching and Workflow Exception Handling
  
 Paybox’s Procure-to-Pay service allows Accounts Payable administrators the ability to configure robust invoice validation business rules where inbound supplier invoices can be automatically matched against orders, variable consumption reports, or other business documents. Noncompliant invoices and line items are flagged and routed for exception workflow handling.
 Vendor Boarding and Supplier Services
  
 A key component of deploying Procure-to-Pay services is to assure that suppliers register with such services and are properly ‘boarded’ into the Procure-to-Pay environment. Paybox provides a complete set of suppliers’ services such as webinars, training materials, and help services embedded within the service offering. Additionally, Paybox provides vendor boarding campaigns which include statistical analysis of vendor invoice submission, and calling and email programs that effectively communicate the buyer’s strategic direction to the suppliers requiring their participation.
 Invoice Approval & Payment
  
 Once invoices have been validated they can be routed to the Accounts Payable financial system for disbursement or paid within the Paybox self-service portal. The service fully integrates with all of the major ERP systems, ensuring seamless system interoperability.
 Audit and Traceability
  
 Paybox’s Procure-to-Pay and Order-to-Cash service offerings support a complete audit log whereby all internal and external user actions are logged, tracked and presented in views of user activity history. At any time, authorized administrators can review online user activity and monitor user adoption.

  SALES AND MARKETING
  
  Channels to Market
  
 Paybox has two primary marketing channels: (i) direct: through our sales representatives; and (ii) indirect: through strategic partners, like HPE. These channels are supported by a technical sales support group.
 Direct
  
 Our direct sales organization consists of senior sales associates complemented by sales support resources. The sales associates and support resources are primarily responsible for qualifying direct opportunities. Sales associates engage in direct sales activities that include business value analysis and alignment, capabilities demonstrations, procurement and contract management. Paybox’s executive management team is actively involved with and complements Paybox’s direct sales organization.
 Indirect
  
 Paybox continues to pursue and utilize both reseller agreements and strategic partnerships as tools in our effort to acquire new customers and revenue streams and in certain instances enhance our current offerings to existing accounts. Paybox has executed reseller agreements with several business partners, such as HPE, who provide Business Process Outsourcing/Financial Services and offer our Accounts Payable/Accounts Receivable Automation and Payment services to their existing clients, or in certain cases we develop and deploy a dual go-to-market strategy to new clients. Paybox has formed strategic partnerships with several business partners who provide inbound mail drop boxes, paper scanning services, image capture, image and document routing and reporting services and in certain other cases, both software and financial certification and verification services. The utilization of both these reseller agreements and strategic partnerships is a critical and cost effective way to be introduced to new customers and potential revenue streams. Further, Paybox is able to leverage the investment of our partners to combine and enhance the Paybox suite of products that can be introduced and sold to the market.
  
 The successful launch of PAYBOX in 2014 created a partnership with Paybox’s global bank client. As a result of such partnership, PAYBOX has been introduced to the global bank’s existing and potential customers and the Company expects that will continue in the future.
  

  Technical Sales Support and Post-Sales Account Management
  
 Paybox has a pre-sales support staff and adds post-sales support to the existing client services management group as it secures new business. This group is responsible for technical sales presentations, developing proposals and pricing, contract administration and post-implementation account relationship management.
 Certified Partnerships
  
 In 2010, Paybox achieved SAP partner certification. As a result of the certified integration, Invoices On-Line (“IOL”) now provides seamless interoperability with more than twenty different business objects supported by SAP ERP systems. This allows Paybox SAP customers the ability to automate and extend their Procure-to-Pay or Order-to-Cash processes to the cloud, including purchase order distribution, invoice receipt and validation, workflow, and electronic payments.

  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
  
 The computer software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, which requires ongoing development and maintenance of software products. It is customary for modifications to be made to a software product as experience with its use grows or changes in manufacturers’ hardware and software so require.
  
 We believe that our research and development staff, many with extensive experience in the industry, represents a significant competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2016, our research and development group consisted of 14 employees. Further, when needed, we retain the services of independent professional consultants. We seek to recruit highly qualified employees, and our ability to attract and retain such employees is expected to be a principal factor in our success in maintaining a leading technological position. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, research and development expenses were approximately $1,367,000, $1,560,000 and $1,738,000, respectively. An additional $107,000, $194,000 and $474,000 were accounted for as capitalized software in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe that continued investments in research and development are required in order to remain competitive.
  
  COMPETITION
  
 We believe our competitors may provide some or all of the services we provide to the marketplace. Our competitors offer some of the various components or functions in Accounts Receivable Automation, Accounts Payable Automation and Payments Processing. Our primary competitors include Ariba, Inc., Basware Corporation, Billtrust, Bottomline Technologies, Corcentric Cloud Solutions, LLC, Direct Commerce Inc., Genpact Limited, Taulia Inc., and Tradeshift Inc., among others.
  
 Many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition, larger installed customer bases, longer operating histories, and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than Paybox. We cannot assume that current and potential competitors will not develop products that may be or may be perceived to be more effective or responsive to technological change than are our current or future products or that our technologies and products will not be rendered obsolete by such developments. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share.
  
  EMPLOYEES
  
 We have 37 employees, of whom 32 were full-time, all in the United States, including 24 in production, development and technical support (20 full-time), 3 in sales and marketing, 5 in technical sales support and post-sales management, and 5 in corporate finance and administration. Our future success will depend in part upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have no collective bargaining agreements with any labor unions.
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
  
 We rely on proprietary knowledge and employ various methods, including confidentiality agreements, to protect our software code, concepts, ideas and documentation of our proprietary technology. We own a copyright for Invoices on-Line (IOL), and trademarks for Direct Insite® and PAYBOX®.
  
 Despite our efforts, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products, obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or misappropriate our copyrights, trademarks, trade dress and similar proprietary rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate. In addition, our competitors might independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products or circumvent any patents or our other intellectual property rights.
