Item 1. Business 
Overview
 
We are commercializing and developing the MicroCutter 5/80TM Stapler based on our proprietary ‘‘staple-on-a-strip’’ technology intended for use by thoracic, pediatric, bariatric, colorectal and general surgeons. Our proprietary ‘‘staple-on-a-strip’’ technology enables us to develop products with innovative features such as consistent staple forms, significantly reduced tool shaft diameter and increased articulation. Together these advances in stapler design enable surgeons to perform procedures on a broader array of patients and to develop procedural methods previously unattainable with existing products in the market. The MicroCutter 5/80, which is currently commercially available, is a cartridge-based stapler device with a 5 millimeter shaft diameter, 80 degrees of articulation in both directions, and a 30 millimeter staple line cleared for specified indications for use in the United States, and in the European Union, or EU, for a broader range of specified indications of use. We estimate that the commercially available MicroCutter 5/80, along with our additional potential products, if developed, would be suited for use in approximately 1.4 million procedures annually in the United States, involving, we estimate, over four million staple cartridge deployments, three million of which we believe would be deployed in laparoscopic procedures. 
 
In January 2016, we received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to use the MicroCutter 5/80 with a white reload, to deploy staples for use in thin tissue, and in July 2016, we received FDA 510(k) clearance to use the MicroCutter 5/80 with a blue reload, to deploy staples for use in medium thickness tissue, both for the transection and resection in open or minimally invasive urologic, thoracic, and pediatric surgical procedures. These clearances complement the existing indications for use of the MicroCutter 5/80 in surgical procedures in the small and large intestine and in the appendix. Following the 510(k) clearances, we conducted our evaluation of the MicroCutter 5/80, which deploys both blue and white cartridges, with selected centers of key opinion leaders in the U.S. and Europe through initial market preference testing to evaluate surgeons’ preferences and to validate the MicroCutter’s clinical benefits prior to broadening our commercial launch. We completed our market testing of the MicroCutter 5/80 with approximately 55 procedures and 200 staple cartridge deployments. In this market preference testing, the MicroCutter 5/80 demonstrated reliable and consistent hemostasis (stopping of the blood flow). Following our successful evaluation of the MicroCutter 5/80, we expanded our commercial launch to a select group of customers in the U.S. and Europe. We are conducting the MicroCutter-Assisted Thoracic Surgery Hemostasis, or MATCH, registry, a post-market surveillance registry, to evaluate the hemostasis and ease-of-use for the MicroCutter 5/80. This is an open-label, multi-center registry and we plan to enroll up to 120 patients requiring surgical stapling during a lobectomy (surgical removal of a lobe of an organ) or segmentectomy (surgical removal of a segment of a lung lobe) at leading centers in the U.S. and Europe. As of September 30, 2017, we had enrolled 107 patients in the MATCH registry.

In May 2017, we filed a 510(k) with the FDA seeking to expand the indications for use of the MicroCutter 5/80 to include surgery on solid organs, including liver, pancreas, kidney and spleen. We received clearance from the FDA for this 510(k) in August 2017.
 
Historically, we generated product revenues primarily from the sale of automated anastomotic systems, which are used by cardiac surgeons to perform coronary bypass surgery; however, we started generating revenues from the sales of our MicroCutter products since their introduction in Europe in December 2012 and in the United States in March 2014, and through June 30, 2017, we have generated $2.9 million of net product revenues from the commercial sales of the MicroCutter products. In October 2016, we entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with B. Braun Surgical S.A., or B Braun, for B. Braun to sell our MicroCutter 5/80 surgical stapler in Spain. In March 2017, we and B. Braun, the distribution arm of the B. Braun Aesculap Group headquartered in Tuttlingen, Germany, completed an extensive training symposium for 48 Spanish surgeons in Tuttlingen led by key current U.S. and European surgeons who are users of the MicroCutter 5/80. If the B. Braun effort to market the MicroCutter in Spain is successful, we anticipate that B. Braun will want to distribute the MicroCutter in a number of other countries where they have extensive sales and marketing capabilities. In addition, we are currently in ongoing discussions with B. Braun to extend our business relationship on a more strategic level to include potential distribution rights for both our MicroCutter and cardiac products, a potential investment or potential sale of some or all of our assets. 
 
On August 16, 2010, we entered into a license agreement with Intuitive Surgical Operations, Inc., or Intuitive Surgical, pursuant to which we granted to Intuitive Surgical a worldwide, sublicenseable, exclusive license to use our intellectual property in the robotics field in diagnostic or therapeutic medical procedures, excluding vascular anastomosis applications, On December 31, 2015, we and Intuitive Surgical amended the license agreement to include, among other things, an agreement providing for a feasibility evaluation and potential development of a surgical stapling cartridge for use with Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci Surgical Systems. The six-month feasibility evaluation of our MicroCutterTM technology was completed successfully and Intuitive Surgical exercised its option to initiate a joint development program for an 8-millimeters-in-diameter surgical stapling cartridge for use with the da Vinci Surgical System, and we and Intuitive Surgical entered into a joint development program in which Intuitive Surgical will be responsible for the development work on the stapler and we will be responsible for the development work on the stapler cartridge. Pursuant to the agreement, we will receive further funding for development of the cartridge and tooling as well as a unit-based royalty on commercial sales, if any.
 
We have launched the MicroCutter 5/80 to a limited number of targeted clinical sites in the United States through a direct sales force. We plan for a broader launch of the MicroCutter 5/80 based on our experience from this limited product introduction. Over subsequent quarters, our plan is to hire sales representatives if we are able to raise sufficient additional funding. We are targeting our sales and marketing efforts in Europe on selected thoracic and general surgeons and hospitals directly through distributors. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, we generated net revenue of $3.4 million, including $1.8 million from the sale of automated anastomotic systems, $1.2 million from commercial sales of the MicroCutter products, $0.3 million from license and development revenue and $0.1 million of royalty revenue.
 
We are dealing with a number of risks and challenges in meeting our business objectives. We need to raise additional capital or conclude a strategic partnership which includes an investment to enable us to maintain our business operations, and if we are unable to do so we will need to cease operations. In addition, we are not in compliance for continued listing with two listing requirements for the NASDAQ Capital Market - minimum stockholders’ equity of $2.5 million and share price greater than $1.00 per share - and expect that following the filing of this Form 10-K that NASDAQ will begin to take steps to delist our common stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market. Further, we have experienced interruptions in our ability to produce staple reload cartridges to meet customer demand and as of October 10, 2017, currently have a backorder of approximately $188,000 for MicroCutter 5/80 Staplers and reloads. We are working with our suppliers and our processing steps to solve our supply issues and we continue to work with our investment banker to evaluate and pursue strategic options including possible sales of the company or all or some of our assets. The discussion of future prospects of our business below is based on the assumption that we are able to obtain the necessary capital to continue to operate our business as described below.

MicroCutter Industry Background 
 
Evolution of surgical techniques
 
Open surgery has been the most common form of surgery for many decades. Using open surgical techniques, a surgeon generally creates an incision large enough to allow a direct view of the operating field and inserts the instruments necessary to manipulate the patient's tissues. The large incisions and significant tissue manipulation involved in open surgery cause trauma to the patient, resulting in extended hospitalization and recovery times, increased hospital costs, and additional pain and suffering. 
 
Over the past thirty-five years, technological innovations such as enhanced imaging and instrumentation have facilitated visualization and surgical access through smaller and smaller incisions. These improvements have enabled surgeons to reduce patient trauma, hospital stays and morbidity, while improving recovery times and cosmetic results. This evolution has both been made possible by, and created opportunities for, the development of new categories of surgical devices.
 
Minimally invasive, laparoscopic (abdominal or pelvic cavities) or thoracoscopic (chest cavity) surgery replaces the large incision typically required for open surgery with several small abdominal/thoracic openings and tubes, referred to as ports, that provide access to the organs upon which the surgeon needs to operate. The surgeon uses an endoscope to view the operating field and inserts specialized instruments through the ports to carry out the procedure. The advantages of laparoscopic/thoracoscopic surgery compared to traditional open surgical procedures include shorter post-operative recovery periods with less pain, shorter hospital stays, decreases in post-operative complications and a quicker return to routine activities.

Laparoscopic surgery was originally used by gynecologists for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the ovary and uterus. Removal of the gall bladder by laparoscopic techniques was introduced in the late 1980s. Since that time, many of the procedures that were performed in the past utilizing traditional open surgical techniques have transitioned to minimally invasive surgical approaches including procedures on the appendix, stomach, lungs, colon, uterus and other organs. 
 
Minimally invasive surgeons are using fewer and fewer abdominal and thoracic openings and ports, such as in single incision surgery or uniportal surgery, in which the surgeon operates almost exclusively through a single entry point. Unlike a traditional multi-port laparoscopic approach, single port surgery leaves only a single small scar. Single incision surgery has been used to perform many types of surgery, including removal of the appendix, gall bladder and portions of the lung or colon, as well as bariatric surgeries including gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. 
 
We believe the realization of the full potential of minimally invasive surgery will depend upon the availability of surgical instruments and devices that address the unique challenges of these procedures by offering advanced capabilities, including smaller instrument shaft diameters, increased end-effector articulation, flexible shaft instruments, better ergonomics and greater ease of use than are provided by currently available devices. 
 
Market
 
The use of disposable devices for closing and/or cutting in both traditional and laparoscopic/thoracoscopic surgical procedures has been broadly adopted clinically in a number of surgical specialties including colorectal, bariatric, gynecologic, urologic and thoracic surgery. We estimate that the commercially available MicroCutter 5/80, along with our additional potential products, if developed, would be suited for use in approximately 1.4 million procedures annually in the United States, involving, we estimate, over four million staple cartridge deployments, three million of which we believe would be deployed in laparoscopic procedures. 
Current Devices for Surgical Stapling
 
Current, conventional surgical stapling technology generally involves: 
 

• | individually placing sets of staples in reloadable cartridges, designed for single use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | using a deployment tool, consisting of a handle and shaft (typically with a minimum diameter of 12 millimeters), that is reusable within a single surgical procedure;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | using cartridges that can be loaded, following each deployment, into a receptacle at the end of the deployment tool;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | deploying multiple U-shaped wires against a deforming surface, called an anvil, to reshape the wires into B-shaped wires and thereby connecting or sealing tissue; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | deploying multiple rows of staples, usually two to three rows per side, with a tissue dividing cut between the rows.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Unlike many other surgical instruments and devices, there have been few significant innovations in surgical stapling technology over the past 15 years. 
 
MicroCutter Product Development
 
We believe that our endoscopic MicroCutterTM design potentially addresses many of the limitations in currently available stapling products and provides surgeons with a smaller and more effective stapling and cutting device for more minimally invasive surgical procedures. Key features of our commercially available MicroCutter 5/80 and our planned MicroCutter products include:

• | Staple Design and Formation. Our MicroCutter products utilize our innovative three dimensional, or 3D, staple design, which we engineered in connection with our vascular anastomotic products, that in vascular applications allows single rows of staples to effectively prevent blood leakage at physiological blood pressures. These 3D staples allow for a large contact surface between staple and tissue, which is designed to improve sealing while reducing the likelihood of the staple cutting through tissue. These 3D staples are guided into their final shape by the anvil rather than forced to buckle as is the case with U-shaped wire staples, which reduces the forming forces and is designed to help reduce the likelihood of malformed staples. The 3D design with a rectangular cross-section increases staple stiffness compared to round wire, resulting in a much stronger final form that is more resistant to opening or yielding.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Device Size. By changing the technology used to form the staple, we are able to design our MicroCutter products to have a smaller-sized end-effector and tool shaft. Depending upon the chosen staple line length and staple height, the MicroCutter’s outer diameter could be as small as five millimeters. Due to its smaller size, our MicroCutter should enable procedures requiring minimal access, such as robot-assisted surgery and the emerging area of single incision laparoscopic surgery.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | “Staple-On-A-Strip” Technology. We have further advanced our 3D staple technology in connection with the MicroCutter product line by introducing an innovative design in which 3D staples are stamped from sheet metal and left connected to a metal band that is then loaded into the cartridge. This differs from conventional technology in which individual staples are typically loaded into cartridge bays.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved Staple Formation. We have designed our MicroCutter products to deploy staples with significantly lower deployment forces than conventional staplers. Reduced deployment forces potentially give the user more control during deployment. Additionally, our compact staple mechanism allows more design space to be dedicated to the anvil, which helps to ensure favorable tissue compression. These features combine to result in consistent staple formation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Articulation Rotation and Handling. End-effector size, articulation and rotation improve tissue access and ease of use, and we believe both are expected by surgeons in stapling devices. Our MicroCutter products articulate as much as 80 degrees in both directions, compared to the 45 degrees of maximum articulation achieved with the vast majority of currently marketed linear stapling technologies. In addition, all of our planned future MicroCutter products, if we are able to develop them, are planned to be designed to enable 360-degree rotation of the end-effector. Our MicroCutter 5/80 is a single-hand operated device: 360-degree rotation with up to 80-degree articulation accomplished with two articulation buttons integrated into a single knob at the end of the handle.

MicroCutter Products and Planned Future Products 
 
We have begun a controlled commercial launch, in Europe and the U.S., of the MicroCutter 5/80. Once the MicroCutter 5/80 has received broad commercial acceptance, subject to regulatory clearances and our obtaining sufficient funds to do so, we intend to launch a full range of surgical stapling devices that cover the needs of thoracic, pediatric, bariatric, colorectal and general surgeons as shown in the table below. These future products, if developed, would provide staple line lengths from 30 to 45 millimeters, come in shaft diameters ranging from five to ten millimeters, accommodate staple heights from 2.0 to 5.3 millimeters, articulate up to 80 degrees, and would have a cartridge-based or reload-based design combined with our unique “staple-on-a-strip” technology. In addition, subject to the caveats set forth above, we intend to expand the MicroCutter product line by introducing products with flexible shafts to facilitate minimally invasive procedures. The MicroCutter 5/80 is our only currently commercial product and the only current product we are actively developing. The following table summarizes our current and planned MicroCutter product line. 

MicroCutter Product Line 
-------------------------
Product Family | Staple Line Length | Shaft | Articulation | Status 
MicroCutter 5/80 | 30 mm | 5 mm, Rigid | Up to 80 degrees | Limited market launch in the U.S. and in select countries in Europe
MicroCutter XCHANGE 45 | 45 mm | 8 mm, Rigid | Up to 80 degrees | In development phase 
MicroCutter FLEXCHANGE 30 | 30 mm | 5 mm, Flexible | Up to 80 degrees | In concept phase 

 
MicroCutter 5/80 and XCHANGE Product Family
 
The MicroCutter 5/80 and XCHANGE names refer to the current and planned group of cartridge-based MicroCutter products with rigid shafts that include our proprietary “staple-on-a-strip” technology. The first product in this family is the MicroCutter 5/80 with a 30 mm staple line length. This 5 mm stapling device has been developed with up to 80 degrees of articulation. We also developed and launched additional versions of the MicroCutter 5/80 including reloads with a curved plastic tip at the distal end to facilitate surgeon vision and access for vascular surgical procedures and are developing a version of the MicroCutter 5/80 with a shorter shaft to facilitate certain surgeries. Subsequently, the MicroCutter XCHANGE 45 with 45mm staple line length, if developed, will also be cartridge-based. We believe that the MicroCutter 5/80 is and will be differentiated in the market compared to currently marketed staplers due to its significantly reduced size and ability to articulate up to 80 degrees.

MicroCutter FLEXCHANGE Planned Product 
 
The MicroCutter FLEXCHANGE name refers to the planned reload-based MicroCutter product with a flexible shaft that will also include our proprietary “staple-on-a-strip” technology. The only product currently planned with this feature is the MicroCutter FLEXCHANGE 30 with a 30 mm staple line length. We expect this product would be the first and only 5 mm stapling device available on the market with a flexible shaft and, if developed, would be developed with up to 80 degrees of articulation in both directions as currently there are no other products on the market that have these characteristics. This device is planned to facilitate endoscopic procedures requiring cutting and stapling.
 
MicroCutter Technology License Agreement 
 
On August 16, 2010, we entered into a license agreement with Intuitive Surgical Operations, Inc., or Intuitive Surgical, pursuant to which we granted to Intuitive Surgical a worldwide, sublicenseable, exclusive license to use our intellectual property in the robotics field in diagnostic or therapeutic medical procedures, excluding vascular anastomosis applications, referred to as the License Agreement. In consideration for this license, we received an up-front license fee of $9.0 million. Each party has the right to terminate the License Agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy. Following any termination of the License Agreement, the licenses granted to Intuitive Surgical will continue, and, except in the case of termination for our or Intuitive Surgical’s uncured material breach or insolvency, Intuitive Surgical’s payment obligations will continue as well. Under the License Agreement, Intuitive Surgical has rights to improvements in our technology and intellectual property over a specified period of time. 
 
On December 31, 2015, we and Intuitive Surgical amended the license agreement to include, among other things, an agreement providing for a feasibility evaluation and potential development of a surgical stapling cartridge for use with Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci Surgical Systems Under the terms of the amendment, Intuitive Surgical paid a one-time, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $2.0 million to extend its rights to improvements in our stapling technology and certain patents until August 16, 2018, and to provide for a feasibility evaluation period from December 31, 2015 to June 30, 2016. In addition, the amendment provides that each of the parties releases the other party from any claims they have or may have against the other party. 
 
The feasibility evaluation allowed Intuitive Surgical to test and evaluate our MicroCutter technology. The six-month feasibility evaluation of our MicroCutter technology was completed successfully and Intuitive Surgical exercised its option to initiate a joint development program for an 8-millimeters-in-diameter surgical stapling cartridge for use with the da Vinci Surgical System, and we and Intuitive Surgical entered into a joint development program in which Intuitive Surgical will be responsible for the development work on the stapler and we will be responsible for the development work on the stapler cartridge. Pursuant to the agreement, we will receive further funding for development of the cartridge and tooling as well as a unit-based royalty on commercial sales, if any.
 
MicroCutter Product Sales and Marketing
 
Total product sales of our MicroCutter products were $1.2 million, $0.4 million and $0.7 million for fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing 35%, 9% and 23% of total revenues for fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 
United States
 

We have launched the MicroCutter 5/80 to a limited number of targeted clinical sites in the United States. We are learning from these sites the time and training required to achieve routine clinical adoption of the MicroCutter 5/80. We will base a broader launch of the MicroCutter 5/80 on our experience from this limited product introduction. Over subsequent quarters, our plan is to hire sales representatives to expand our launch in the United States. We initiated the MATCH registry, a post-market surveillance registry, to evaluate the hemostasis and ease-of-use for the MicroCutter 5/80. We plan to enroll up to 120 patients requiring surgical stapling during a lobectomy of the lung (surgical removal of a lobe of an organ) or segmentectomy of the lung (surgical removal of a segment of a lung lobe) at leading centers in the U.S. and Europe. As of September 30, 2017, we had enrolled 107 patients in the MATCH registry. Additionally, in May 2017 we submitted a 510(k) to the FDA seeking to expand the indications for use of the MicroCutter to include liver, pancreas, kidney and spleen surgery. We received clearance from the FDA for this 510(k) in August 2017.
 

Total U.S. product sales of our MicroCutter products were $0.3 million, $0.1 million and $0.5 million for fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing 8%, 2% and 17% of total revenue for fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

International
 
We are targeting our sales and marketing efforts in Europe on selected thoracic and general surgeons and hospitals with an emphasis on video-assisted thoracic surgery, or VATS. We have a number of VATS hospitals and surgeons in Germany and plan to expand to other countries in Europe through our distributors. 
 
Total international product sales of our MicroCutter products were $0.9 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million for fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing 27%, 7% and 7% of total revenue for fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
MicroCutter Competition
 
The MicroCutter 5/80 competes, and our other planned products in the MicroCutter product line if they receive regulatory clearance and are successfully launched would compete, in the market for stapling and cutting devices against laparoscopic stapling and sealing devices currently marketed around the world. We believe the principal competitive factors in the market for laparoscopic staplers include:
 

• | reduced product size;
--+----------------------


• | ease of use;
--+-------------


• | product quality and reliability;
--+---------------------------------


• | device cost-effectiveness;
--+---------------------------


• | degree of articulation;
--+------------------------


• | surgeon relationships; and
--+---------------------------


• | sales and marketing capabilities.
--+----------------------------------

 
Three large competitors, Ethicon, part of Johnson & Johnson, Covidien, now part of Medtronic, and Intuitive Surgical currently control more than 80% of this market. Other large competitors in the laparoscopic device market include Stryker Endoscopy and Olympus, which acquired another competitor, Gyrus Medical. Ethicon, Covidien, which acquired a small competitor, Power Medical, and Intuitive Surgical each have large direct sales forces in the United States and have been the largest participants in the market for single use disposable or reusable laparoscopic stapling devices for many years. Competing against large established competitors with significant resources may make establishing a market for any products that we develop difficult and the failure to establish a market for our products would have a material adverse effect on our business. A private company, JustRight Surgical, LLC, has announced FDA 510(k) clearance for a 5 millimeter stapler that could be considered competitive with our stapling products, but is more limited in availability with only one staple size for very thin tissue and does not have articulation compared to the MicroCutter 5/80. Further, we may also face additional competition from generic surgical stapling products similar to currently commercially available products following expiration of patents on our competitors’ products. 
 
Our Cardiac Solutions
 
We design, manufacture and market proprietary automated anastomotic systems used by surgeons to perform anastomoses during on- or off-pump CABG procedures. We believe that by enabling consistent and reliable anastomoses of the vessels at this most critical step in CABG surgery through a fast, automated process, our products can improve the quality and consistency of these anastomoses, which we believe will ultimately contribute to improved patient outcomes. We have designed our products to meet the needs of surgeons, including:

• | Physiological features. Our clips use medical grade stainless steel that is identical to that used in conventional coronary stents, which is known to be compatible with the human body (in the absence of allergies to certain components of medical grade stainless steel). Our products minimize trauma to both the graft and target vessel during loading and deployment, thereby reducing the risk of scar formation and associated narrowings or occlusions. Additionally, our PAS-Port system can be used without clamping the aorta, which has been shown to be a cause of adverse events, including neurological complications. In addition, our C-Port system creates compliant anastomoses, which potentially allow the shape and size of the anastomosis to adapt to changes in flow and blood pressure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Handling features. Our anastomotic systems can create anastomoses more rapidly than hand suturing, resulting in a surgical procedure that can be performed more quickly. For example, the PAS-Port system can be set-up and deployed in approximately three minutes compared with approximately ten to 25 minutes for a hand-sewn anastomosis. In addition, the system is easy to use, typically requiring only a few hours of training to become technically proficient in the technique. The C-Port system is compatible with coronary arteries as small as 1.3 millimeters in internal diameter, which is typically the lower limit of target vessels considered to be candidates for revascularization. The C-Port system can also be deployed at various angles, allowing access to all coronary targets during both on- and off-pump procedures. Both the C-Port system and the PAS-Port system are designed as integrated products, where all steps necessary to create an anastomosis are performed by a single tool, with one user interface. The need for target vessel preparation is minimal for the PAS-Port system, a feature that is especially important in patients undergoing a second or third coronary bypass procedure with the presence of significant scarring in and around the heart and aorta.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Standardized results. Our products enable consistent, reproducible anastomoses, largely independent of surgical technique and skill set, using a wide range in quality of graft tissues. In comparison with hand-sewn sutures, our systems offer mechanically-governed repeatability and reduced procedural complexity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced costs. Because our products can help to expedite the CABG procedure, we believe that they may contribute to reduced operating room time and a reduction in associated expenses, partially offset by the increased direct cost of our products compared to current alternatives, such as sutures. Additionally, our C-Port system creates anastomoses rapidly and does not require the interruption of blood flow. This may reduce some of the technical challenges inherent in performing anastomosis in off-pump procedures, which may advance adoption of the off-pump approach. By helping more surgeons perform off-pump CABG, the need for a costly pump may also be reduced or eliminated, thereby potentially reducing the total direct costs of the procedure. The C-Port Flex A allows the surgeon to perform coronary revascularization through small openings in the chest wall, thereby reducing the trauma and morbidity associated with the CABG procedure, which therefore may help reduce costs by reducing the time to patient discharge. Finally, to the extent complications such as strokes or injury to the heart muscle decrease, post-operative costs of a CABG procedure may be significantly reduced.

Our Cardiac Products

We currently market three proprietary products to perform anastomoses, the C-Port xA system, the C-Port Flex A system and the PAS-Port system. The C-Port systems automate a distal anastomosis between the graft vessel and target artery. The C-Port xA system was developed to use veins and arteries as the bypass graft vessel and received 510(k) clearance in November 2006. A new generation of the C-Port xA system, the C-Port Flex A system, designed to further enable minimally invasive CABG surgery, received 510(k) clearance in March 2007. Each of our C-Port systems has received the CE Mark for sales in Europe. As of June 30, 2017, we had sold an aggregate of over 15,300 units of all the versions of our C-Port systems. The PAS-Port system automates the performance of a proximal anastomosis between a graft vessel, typically a saphenous vein, and the aorta. The PAS-Port system received 510(k) clearance in September 2008 following successful completion of a prospective, international, randomized study. Our PAS-Port system also has received the CE Mark. The PAS-Port system is marketed in the United States, Europe and Japan. As of June 30, 2017, over 47,600 PAS-Port systems had been sold, primarily in Japan and the United States. 
C-Port® Distal Anastomosis Systems

C-Port® xA Anastomosis System

Our C-Port xA Distal Anastomosis System, which may be used in either on- or off-pump CABG procedures, is designed to perform an end-to-side distal anastomosis by attaching the end of a bypass graft to a coronary artery downstream of an occlusion or narrowing. The C-Port xA system is inserted in a small incision in the coronary artery with a bypass graft vessel attached to the device. The C-Port xA system is actuated by depressing a trigger which activates a manifold powered by a cylinder of compressed carbon dioxide to provide smooth actuation. Miniature stainless steel staples are deployed to securely attach the bypass graft to the coronary artery and at the same time a miniature knife completes an opening inside the coronary artery to complete the bypass. After deployment, the C-Port system is removed from the coronary artery and the entry incision is closed typically with a single stitch. Our C-Port xA system is effective in creating compliant anastomoses in vessels as small as 1.3 millimeters in internal diameter. In addition, the C-Port xA system has been designed to:

• | perform an end-to-side anastomosis without interruption of native coronary blood flow, which is not possible in a conventional hand-sewn anastomosis during off-pump surgery without the use of a temporarily placed vascular shunt;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | achieve nearly complete alignment of the natural blood lining surfaces of the coronary artery and the bypass graft to minimize scarring and potential occlusion of the anastomosis;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | minimize the amount of foreign material in the blood stream that may cause clotting and subsequent graft failure; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | be suitable for all grafts typically used in CABG procedures with wall thicknesses of less than or equal to 1.4 millimeters.

C-Port® Flex A Anastomosis System

The C-Port Flex A system includes modifications to the C-Port xA system that are designed to enable automated anastomoses to be performed as part of minimally invasive and robot-facilitated CABG procedures. The C-Port Flex A system includes all of the features and benefits of the C-Port xA system and has a flexible, rather than rigid, shaft. The flexible shaft is designed to allow the working end of the device that creates the anastomosis to be inserted through a 14-millimeter diameter port to access the chest cavity and heart. The device is designed to be loaded with the bypass graft vessel inside or outside the chest cavity and deployed to create the anastomosis to the coronary artery. This product is designed to enable technology for completion of robotically assisted, including endoscopic, CABG surgery through four or five relatively small incisions between the ribs. Avoiding both the incision through the sternum and the use of the pump should significantly reduce patient trauma and accelerate post-operative recovery.
PAS-Port® Proximal Anastomosis System

Our PAS-Port system is a fully automated device used to perform an end-to-side proximal anastomosis between a saphenous vein and the aorta. To complete a proximal anastomosis, the cardiac surgeon simply loads the bypass graft vessel into the PAS-Port system, places the end of the delivery device against the aorta and turns the knob on the opposite end of the delivery tool. The device first creates an opening in the aorta and subsequently securely attaches the bypass graft to the aortic wall, using a medical grade stainless steel implant that is formed into its final shape by the delivery tool. The innovative design of the PAS-Port system allows the surgeon to load the bypass graft and rapidly complete the anastomosis, typically in approximately three minutes, with little or no injury to the bypass graft vessel or the aorta.
 
An important advantage of our PAS-Port system is that, in contrast to conventional hand-sewn proximal anastomoses, the vascular connections created can be performed without clamping the aorta, potentially avoiding associated risks, such as neurological complications. Surgeons use our PAS-Port system in conventional CABG procedures and in OPCAB. Similar to hand-sewn anastomosis, anastomoses completed using our PAS-Port system occasionally require additional stitches intra-operatively to obtain hemostasis (absence of bleeding in the anastomosis site). These additional stitches may be required intra-operatively in an individual anastomosis depending on the quality of the target and graft vessels, adequacy of target site preparation and quality of the loading of the graft to the deployment cartridge.
 
Cardiac Product Sales and Marketing
 
United States
 
Our cardiac products focus on the needs of cardiovascular surgeons worldwide. We have an agreement with an independent medical device manufacturers’ representatives group to sell our products domestically. We utilize this manufacturers’ representatives group who carries other cardiac surgery products, are clinically knowledgeable and are capable of training cardiac surgeons on the use of our products and proctoring initial cases in the operating room. 
International
 
We currently distribute our PAS-Port system in Japan through our exclusive distributor, Century Medical, Inc., or Century, pursuant to a distribution agreement entered into in June 2003, which has been subsequently amended. The latest amendment, effective July 1, 2014, among other things, extended the term of the distribution agreement for another five years, extending the expiration date to July 31, 2019. 
 
 
9



For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, sales to Century accounted for approximately 21%, 21% and 28%, respectively, of our total revenue and approximately 24%, 34% and 28%, respectively, of our product sales. Our agreement with Century pertaining to the PAS-Port system, as amended, expires in July 2019, but automatically renews for an additional five-year term if Century meets certain sales milestones. Either party may terminate this agreement if the other party defaults in performance of material obligations and such default is not cured within a specified period or if the other party becomes insolvent or subject to bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, we may terminate the agreement within 90 days following a change of control by payment of a specified termination fee. 
 
For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, sales to Herz-Und Diabeteszentrum in Germany, a customer for our C-Port and PAS-Port systems, accounted for approximately 8%, 8% and 10%, respectively, of our total revenue and approximately 9%, 13% and 10%, respectively, of our product sales. 
 
For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, sales to B. Braun in Spain, a customer for our MicroCutter systems, accounted for approximately 9%, 0% and 0%, respectively, of our total revenue and approximately 10%, 0% and 0%, respectively, of our product sales. 
 
Total product sales of our C-Port and PAS-Port systems were $1.8 million, $2.1 million and $2.2 million, for fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total product sales of our C-Port and PAS-Port systems represented 54%, 53% and 74% of total revenues for fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
We are continuing to sell to selected international customers and will continue to evaluate further opportunities to expand our distribution network in Europe and in other parts of the world where the healthcare economics are conducive to the introduction and adoption of new medical device technologies.
 
Cardiac Product Competition
 
The market for medical devices used in the treatment of coronary artery disease is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change, and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We believe the principal competitive factors in the market for medical devices used in the treatment of coronary artery disease include:

• | improved patient outcomes;
--+---------------------------


• | access to and acceptance by leading physicians;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | product quality and reliability;
--+---------------------------------


• | ease of use;
--+-------------


• | device cost-effectiveness;
--+---------------------------


• | training and support;
--+----------------------


• | novelty;
--+---------


• | physician relationships; and
--+-----------------------------


• | sales and marketing capabilities.
--+----------------------------------

 
There are numerous potential competitors in the medical device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, such as Maquet Cardiovascular LLC, formerly the cardiac surgery division of Boston Scientific Corporation, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, Inc., Abbott Laboratories, which acquired an additional division of Guidant Corporation, and Medtronic, Inc., that are targeting the treatment of coronary artery disease broadly. Each of these companies has significantly greater financial, clinical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and technical resources and experience than we have. In addition, new companies have been, and are likely to continue to be, formed to pursue opportunities in our market. 
 
The landscape of active competitors in the market for anastomotic solutions is currently limited. Several companies market systems designed to facilitate or stabilize proximal anastomoses, such as Maquet Cardiovascular’s Heartstring Aortic Occluder and Vitalitec’s Enclose II proximal anastomosis assist device. Our PAS-Port system is the only commercially available automated proximal anastomosis device. Our C-Port systems are the only automated anastomosis devices for distal anastomosis cleared for marketing in the United States. 
 
 
10



Currently, the vast majority of anastomoses are performed with sutures and, for the foreseeable future, sutures will continue to be the principal competitor for alternative anastomotic solutions. The direct cost of sutures used for anastomoses in CABG procedures is far less expensive than the direct cost of automated anastomotic systems, and surgeons, who have been using sutures for their entire careers, have been reluctant to consider alternative technologies, despite potential advantages.
 
In addition, cardiovascular diseases may also be treated by other methods that do not require anastomoses, including interventional techniques such as balloon angioplasty and use of drug-eluting stents, pharmaceuticals, atherectomy catheters and lasers. Further, technological advances with other therapies for cardiovascular disease such as drugs, local gene therapy or future innovations in cardiac surgery techniques could make other methods of treating this disease safer, more effective or less expensive than CABG procedures.
 
Manufacturing
 
Our manufacturing operations, sterile products manufacturing, assembly, packaging, storage and shipping, as well as our research and development laboratories and administrative activities all take place at our headquarters facility. Our lease expires on August 31, 2018, with the option to extend for a period of three years beyond the expiration date. We are also exploring other leasing space in the San Francisco Bay Area.
 
We believe our manufacturing operations are in compliance with regulations mandated by the FDA and European Union. Our quality system is International Standards Organization, or ISO, 13485:2003 certified. In connection with our CE mark approval and compliance with European quality standards, our facility was initially certified in June 2002 and has been inspected annually thereafter.
 
There are a number of critical components and sub-assemblies required for manufacturing the MicroCutter product line and C-Port and PAS-Port systems that we purchase from third-party suppliers. The vendors for these materials are qualified using defined processes within our quality system and include evaluation and monitoring of their performance over time. We audit our critical component manufacturers on a regular basis and at varied intervals based on the nature and complexity of the components they provide and the risk associated with the components’ failure.
 
We use or rely upon sole source suppliers for certain components and services used in manufacturing our products, and we utilize materials and components supplied by third parties, with whom we do not have any long-term contracts. Many suppliers have ceased supplying materials for use in implantable medical devices. We cannot quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for certain components or materials, due to both the complex nature of the manufacturing processes employed by our suppliers and the time and effort that may be required to obtain FDA clearance or other regulatory approval to use materials from alternative suppliers. Any significant supply interruption or capacity constraints affecting our facilities or those of our suppliers would affect our ability to manufacture and distribute our products.
 
We have experienced interruptions in our ability to produce staple reload cartridges to meet customer demand and as of October 10, 2017, have a backorder of approximately $188,000 for MicroCutter 5/80 Staplers and reloads. Our production of reloads requires a staple supply that is dependent on a number of processing steps beginning with the properties of the raw material, which is medical grade stainless steel. Each step in the process from stamping, electropolishing, bending the staple strip and laser welding it in the reload cartridge all can have an impact on the acceptable performance of the staples. We are working with our suppliers and the processing steps to resolve performance issues and ensure adequate supply. 
 
Third-Party Reimbursement

Sales of medical products are increasingly dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors such as government and private insurance plans. In the United States, as well as in foreign countries, government-funded or private insurance programs, commonly known as third-party payors, pay the cost of a significant portion of a patient’s medical expenses. Successful sales of our products will depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. No uniform policy of coverage or reimbursement for medical technology exists among all these payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
 
Hospitals and other healthcare providers that purchase medical devices, such as the ones that we manufacture, rely on third-party payors to pay for all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with these devices. The existence of adequate reimbursement for the procedures performed with our MicroCutter and cardiac surgery products by government and private insurance plans are central to acceptance of our current and future products. We may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis if third-party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of payment, or if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels. 
 
 
11



Many private payors use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, which administers the Medicare program, as guidelines in setting their reimbursement policies. Future action by CMS or other government agencies may diminish payments to physicians, outpatient centers and hospitals. Those private payors that do not follow the Medicare guidelines may adopt different reimbursement policies for procedures performed with our products. For some governmental programs, such as Medicaid, reimbursement differs from state to state, and some state Medicaid programs may not pay for the procedures performed with our products in an adequate amount, if at all.
 
Once a device has received approval or clearance for marketing by the FDA, there is no assurance that Medicare will cover the device and related services. In some cases, CMS may place certain restrictions on the circumstances in which coverage will be available. In making such coverage determinations, CMS considers, among other things, peer-reviewed publications concerning the effectiveness of the technology, the opinions of medical specialty societies, input from the FDA, the National Institutes of Health, and other government agencies. We cannot assure you that our MicroCutter products and/or our cardiac surgery products will be covered by Medicare and other third-party payors. Limited coverage of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
In general, Medicare makes a predetermined, fixed payment amount for its beneficiaries receiving covered inpatient services in acute care hospitals. This payment methodology is part of the inpatient prospective payment system, or IPPS. For acute care hospitals, under IPPS, payment for an inpatient stay is based on diagnosis-related groups, or DRGs, which include reimbursement for all covered medical services and medical products that are provided during a hospital stay. Additionally, a relative weight is calculated for each individual DRG which represents the average resources required to care for cases in that particular DRG relative to the average resources required to treat cases in all DRGs. Generally, DRG relative weights are adjusted annually to reflect changes in medical practice in a budget neutral manner. 
 
CMS has made no decisions with respect to DRG assignment when patients undergo thoracic, bariatric, colorectal, general or CABG procedures in which our MicroCutter or cardiac surgery products would be used, and there can be no assurance that the DRG to which such patients will be assigned will result in Medicare payment levels that are considered by hospitals to be adequate to support purchase of our products.
 
As is the case with other endoscopic stapling devices available in the U.S. today, we do not anticipate that our MicroCutter products will be reimbursed separately by third-party payors. Our cardiac surgery technologies bring added direct costs to medical providers and may not be reimbursed separately by third-party payors at rates sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. Many private payors look to CMS in setting their reimbursement policies and payment amounts. If CMS or other agencies limit coverage and decrease or limit reimbursement payments for hospitals and physicians, this may affect coverage and reimbursement determinations by many private payors.
 
Coverage and reimbursement therefore depend on our ability to demonstrate the short-term and long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness of our products from the results we obtain from clinical experience and formal clinical studies. We have not collected, and are not aware that others have collected, long-term data regarding efficacy, safety and clinical outcomes associated with the use of our MicroCutter products. 
 
For classification of physician services, the American Medical Association, referred to as the AMA, has developed a coding system known as the Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT. CPT codes are established by the AMA and adopted by the Medicare program in the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, to describe and develop payment amounts for physician services. Physician services are reimbursed by Medicare based on a physician fee schedule whereby payment is based generally on the number of “relative value units” assigned by CMS to the service furnished by the physician. No decision has been made concerning whether existing CPT codes would be appropriate for use in coding thoracic, bariatric, colorectal, general or CABG procedures when our products are used or if new CPT codes and payment are required. We cannot assure you that codes used for submitting claims for procedures using our products will result in incremental payment to physicians. CPT codes are used by many other third-party payors in addition to Medicare. Failure by physicians to receive what they consider to be adequate reimbursement for procedures in which our products are used could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our international success will depend upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing foreign healthcare payment systems. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country and include both government-sponsored healthcare and private insurance. 
 
All third-party reimbursement programs, whether government funded or insured commercially, whether inside the United States or outside, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs through prospective reimbursement and capitation programs, group purchasing, redesign of benefits, second opinions required prior to major surgery, careful review of bills, encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more cost-effective methods of delivering healthcare. These types of programs and legislative changes to reimbursement policies could potentially limit the amount which healthcare providers may be willing to pay for medical devices. 
 
 
12



As the portion of the United States population over age 65 and eligible for Medicare continues to grow we may be more vulnerable to reimbursement limitations imposed by CMS. Furthermore, the healthcare industry in the United States has experienced a trend toward cost containment as government and private insurers seek to control healthcare costs by imposing lower payment rates and negotiating reduced contract rates with service providers. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the procedures performed with our products will be adequately reimbursed.
 
Research and Development
 
As of June 30, 2017, we had 15 employees in our research and development department. Future research and development efforts, if we are able to obtain funding to do so, will involve development of the MicroCutter in a variety of formats that accommodate different staple sizes and staple line lengths and different tool form factors, such as flexible versus rigid shafts, reloads with a curved plastic tip at the distal end to facilitate surgeon vision and access for vascular surgical procedures, and a shorter shaft to facilitate certain surgeries. We are also exploring the development of other products that can be derived from our core technology platform and intellectual property. Research and development expenses for fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $6.6 million, $6.3 million and $7.3 million, respectively. Even if we are able to obtain additional funding to continue our business, we expect research and development expenses to decrease slightly in absolute dollar terms in fiscal year 2018 due to less spending in prototype and design materials and consulting, partially offset by increases in salaries and benefits, tooling and NRE expenses.
Patents and Intellectual Property 
 
We believe our competitive position will depend significantly upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. As of June 30, 2017, we had 148 issued U.S. patents, of which 55 are related to our MicroCutter products, 29 additional U.S. patent applications, of which 21 are related to our MicroCutter products, 28 issued foreign patents, of which 12 are related to our MicroCutter products, and another 39 patent applications filed in select international markets, of which 34 are related to our MicroCutter products. Our issued patents expire between 2018 and 2034, with the issued patents related to our MicroCutter products expiring between 2027 and 2034.
 
We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements in connection with their employment, consulting or advisory relationships with us. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will not be breached or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that competitors will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our rights in unpatented proprietary technology.
 
Patent applications in the United States and in foreign countries are maintained in secrecy for a period of time after filing, which results in a delay between the actual discoveries and the filing of related patent applications and the time when discoveries are published in scientific and patent literature. Patents issued and patent applications filed relating to medical devices are numerous, and there can be no assurance that current and potential competitors and other third parties have not filed or in the future will not file applications for, or have not received or in the future will not receive, patents or obtain additional proprietary rights relating to products, devices or processes used or proposed to be used by us. We are aware of patents issued to third parties that contain subject matter related to our technology. We believe that the technologies we employ in our products and systems do not infringe the valid claims of any such patents. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not seek to assert that our devices and systems infringe their patents or seek to expand their patent claims to cover aspects of our products and systems, or that we will have the financial resources to defend our intellectual property.
 
The medical device industry, in general, and the industry segment that includes products for the treatment of cardiovascular disease in particular, has been characterized by substantial litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Any such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to respond to and could divert our technical and management personnel. We may be involved in litigation to defend against claims of infringement by other patent holders, to enforce patents issued to us, or to protect our trade secrets. If any relevant claims of third-party patents are upheld as valid and enforceable in any litigation or administrative proceeding, we could be prevented from practicing the subject matter claimed in such patents, or would be required to obtain licenses from the patent owners of each such patent, or to redesign our products, devices or processes to avoid infringement. There can be no assurance that such licenses would be available or, if available, would be available on terms acceptable to us or that we would be successful in any attempt to redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement. Further, we currently do not have the financial resources to defend our intellectual property, and there is no assurance that we would have the financial resources to defend our intellectual property in the future. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Costly and time-consuming litigation brought by us may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how owned by us or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others, and we currently do not have the resources to engage in such litigation. See “Risk Factors.”

Government Regulation

The FDA and other regulatory bodies extensively regulate the research, development, manufacture, labeling, distribution, import/export, sales and marketing of our products. Our current products are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, and we are required to obtain review and clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercializing our devices in the United States.
 
FDA regulations govern nearly all of the activities that we perform, or that are performed on our behalf, to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses. The activities that the FDA regulates include the following:
 

• | product design, development and manufacture;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | product safety, testing, labeling and storage;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | pre-clinical testing in animals and in the laboratory;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | clinical investigations in humans;
--+-----------------------------------


• | marketing applications, such as 510(k) notifications and Premarket Approval, or PMA, applications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | record keeping and document retention procedures;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | advertising and promotion;
--+---------------------------


• | product marketing, distribution and recalls; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | post-marketing surveillance and medical device reporting, including reporting of deaths, serious injuries, device malfunctions or other adverse events.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device distributed commercially in the United States will require either prior 510(k) clearance or PMA from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Class I devices are subject to only general controls, such as establishment registration and device listing, labeling, medical device reporting, and prohibitions against adulteration and misbranding. Class II medical devices generally require prior 510(k) clearance before they may be commercially marketed in the United States. The FDA will clear marketing of a medical device through the 510(k) process if the FDA is satisfied that the new product has been demonstrated to be substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device, or predicate, device, and otherwise meets the FDA’s requirements. Class II devices are also subject to general controls and may be subject to performance standards and other special controls. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, are placed in Class III, generally requiring submission of a PMA supported by clinical trial data.
 
510(k) Clearance Pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a notification to the FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, i.e., a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class I or Class II, or a 510(k)-cleared device. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is submitted, but can take significantly longer. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously-cleared device or use, the device is automatically placed into Class III, requiring the submission of a PMA. Any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance and may even, in some circumstances, require a PMA, if the change raises complex or novel scientific issues. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make the determination regarding the need for a new 510(k) submission in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer’s decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or PMAs for any modifications, we may be required to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device, if already in distribution, until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained and we could be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. The availability of the 510(k) pathway for our product candidates and the timing and data burden required to obtain 510(k) clearance could be adversely impacted by ongoing attempts to reform the 510(k) system. Furthermore, our products could be subject to voluntary recall if we or the FDA determines, for any reason, that our products pose a risk of injury or are otherwise defective. Moreover, the FDA can order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that our device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. Delays in receipt or failure to receive clearances or approvals, the loss of previously received clearances or approvals, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could reduce our sales, profitability and future growth prospects.
 
 
14



Premarket Approval Pathway. A PMA must be submitted to the FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) notification process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to data obtained from preclinical or clinical studies or relating to manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device.
 
After a PMA submission is complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review, which generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA will typically request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with Quality System Regulation, or QSR. New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for significant modifications to the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
 
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. To perform a clinical trial in the United States for a significant risk device, prior submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, to the FDA is required. An IDE supplement must also be submitted before initiating a new clinical study under an existing IDE, such as initiating a pivotal trial following the conclusion of a feasibility trial. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, and any available data on human clinical experience, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The animal and laboratory testing must meet the FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements.
 
The IDE and any IDE supplement for a new trial must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients. Clinical trials conducted in the United States for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application or IDE supplement is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, overseeing the welfare of the research subjects and responsible for that particular clinical trial. If the product is considered a non-significant risk device under FDA regulations, only the patients’ informed consent and IRB approval are required. Under its regulations, the agency responds to an IDE or an IDE amendment for a new trial within 30 days. The FDA may approve the IDE or amendment, grant an approval with certain conditions, or identify deficiencies and request additional information. It is common for the FDA to require additional information before approving an IDE or amendment for a new trial, and thus final FDA approval on a submission may require more than the initial 30 days. The FDA may also require that a small-scale feasibility study be conducted before a pivotal trial may commence. In a feasibility trial, the FDA limits the number of patients, sites and investigators that may participate. Feasibility trials are typically structured to obtain information on safety and to help determine how large a pivotal trial should be to obtain statistically significant results.
 
Clinical trials are subject to extensive recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Our clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. We are also required to obtain the patients’ informed consent in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. We, the FDA or the IRB may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval to market the product in the United States. Similarly, in Europe the clinical study must be approved by a local ethics committee and in some cases, including studies with high-risk devices, by the ministry of health in the applicable country.

Pervasive and Continuing Regulation. There are numerous regulatory requirements governing the approval and marketing of a product. These include:
 

• | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clearance or approval of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to an adverse event, a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; and

Advertising and promotion of medical devices are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Promotional activities for FDA-regulated products have been the subject of significant enforcement actions brought under healthcare reimbursement laws, “fraud and abuse” laws (such as those prohibiting kickbacks and false claims, discussed below), and consumer protection statutes, among other theories. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims.
 
We have registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR, and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers.
 
Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:
 

• | warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer notifications, repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delay in processing marketing applications for new products or modifications to existing products;

• | mandatory product recalls;

Fraud and Abuse and False Claims. We are directly and indirectly subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with healthcare providers and pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws. In particular, the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Where such activities involve foreign government officials, they may also potentially be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. In implementing the statute, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Services, or OIG, has issued a series of regulations, known as the “safe harbors.” These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable element of a safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG.
 
The Federal False Claims Act imposes civil liability on any person or entity who submits, or causes the submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the United States Government. Damages under the Federal False Claims Act can be significant and consist of the imposition of fines and penalties. Under certain circumstances, the Federal False Claims Act also allows a private individual or entity with knowledge of past or present fraud on the federal government to sue on behalf of the government to recover the civil penalties and up to treble damages. The U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the government has successfully enforced the Federal False Claims Act against medical device manufacturers. Federal suits have alleged that manufacturers whose marketing and promotional practices were found to have included the off-label promotion and/or the payment of prohibited kickbacks to doctors violated the Federal False Claims Act on the grounds that these prohibited activities resulted in the submission of claims to federal and state healthcare entitlement programs such as Medicaid, resulting in the payment of claims for the off-label use that was not otherwise covered. Such manufacturers have entered into settlements with the federal government under which they paid amounts and entered into corporate integrity agreements that require, among other things, substantial reporting and remedial actions.
 
State authorities may likewise seek to enforce the False Claims Act (and/or the state equivalents) against medical device manufacturers. 
 
We believe that our marketing practices are not in violation of the laws mentioned above or their state equivalents, but we cannot assure you that individuals or enforcement authorities will not attempt to take action against us and, if such action were successful, we could be required to pay significant fines and penalties and change our marketing practices. Such enforcement could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to operate.
 
We engage in a variety of activities that are potentially regulated under these laws, including, for example, consulting arrangements with surgeons, grants for training and other education, grants for research, and other interactions with doctors. Failure to comply with applicable legal requirements could potentially result in substantial penalties to us and significant adverse effect on our ability to operate. Even if we structure our programs with the intent of compliance with such laws, there can be no certainty that we would not need to defend against enforcement or litigation, in light of the fact that there is significant enforcement interest in medical device manufacturers in the United States, and some of the applicable laws are quite broad in scope. 
 
We are also subject to various federal and state marketing expenditure tracking and reporting laws, such as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which generally require certain types of expenditures in the United States to be tracked and reported. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and medical device companies to establish marketing compliance programs. Compliance with such requirements may require investment in infrastructure to ensure that tracking is performed properly, and some of these laws result in the public disclosure of various types of payments and relationships. 
 
International Regulation. International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign governmental regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain certification or approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ.
 
The primary regulatory body in Europe is the European Union, or EU, which has adopted numerous directives and has promulgated voluntary standards regulating the design, manufacture and labeling of and clinical trials and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms with the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the member states of the European Union and other countries that comply with or mirror these directives. The method for assessing conformity varies depending upon the type and class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a notified body, which is an independent and neutral institution appointed by a country to conduct the conformity assessment. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s device. Such an assessment is required for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout these countries. ISO 9001 and ISO 13845 certifications are voluntary standards. Compliance establishes the presumption of conformity with the essential requirements for the CE Mark.

In Japan, medical devices must be approved prior to importation and commercial sale by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, or MHLW. Manufacturers of medical devices outside of Japan are required to utilize a contractually bound In-Country Caretaker, or ICC, to submit an application for device approval to the MHLW. The MHLW evaluates each device for safety and efficacy. As part of its approval process, the MHLW may require that the product be tested in Japanese laboratories. The approval process for products such as our existing anastomotic products is typically 13 to 14 months. Other medical devices may require a longer review period for approval. Once approved, the manufacturer may import the device into Japan for sale by the manufacturer’s contractually bound importer or distributor.
 
After a device is approved for importation and commercial sale in Japan, the MHLW continues to monitor sales of approved products for compliance with labeling regulations, which prohibit promotion of devices for unapproved uses and reporting regulations and reporting of product malfunctions, including serious injury or death caused by any approved device. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the MHLW, which may include fines, injunctions, and civil penalties, recall or seizure of our products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of sales in Japan, or criminal prosecution.
 
We have received approval from the MHLW to distribute our PAS-Port system in Japan. We will be required to submit applications with respect to all new products and product enhancements for review and approval by the MHLW. Our contract with Century, our distributor in Japan, has a multi-year term and is renewable for additional multi-year terms upon mutual agreement of the parties.
 
In addition to MHLW oversight, the regulation of medical devices in Japan is also governed by the Japanese Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, or PAL. Under PAL, manufacturers outside of Japan must appoint a “primary distributor” located in Japan that holds a primary distributor license for medical devices to provide primary distribution services, including conducting quality assurance and safety control tasks for each product at the time an application for the approval of each such product is submitted to the MHLW. Century serves as the “primary distributor” for Dextera Surgical. We do not anticipate that these changes will have a material impact on our existing level of third-party reimbursement for sales of our products in Japan. 
 
In Canada, medical devices are regulated by the Therapeutic Products Directorate of Health Canada (“TPD”) and are licensed for sale through submission to the TPD. The timeline for approval is similar to that of the FDA’s 510(k) process. All class II, III and IV Medical Device Licenses (“MDL”) in Canada also require a valid International Organization for Standardization (ISO), 13485 or ISO 13488 Quality System Certificate from a registrar recognized by the Canadian Medical Devices Conformity Assessment System (“CMDCAS”). 
 
Employees
 
As of June 30, 2017, we had 50 employees, including 16 employees in manufacturing, 5 employees in sales and marketing, 5 employees in clinical, regulatory and quality assurance, 9 employees in general and administrative and 15 employees in research and development. We believe that our future success will depend upon our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, and we currently do not have the funds to do so. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our employee relations are good.
