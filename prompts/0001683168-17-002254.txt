Item 1. Description of Business
BACKGROUND
 
Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we", "our", "us", "OMNI", OMGT or "Omni Global Technologies, Inc." refers to Omni Global Technologies Inc. (formerly Business.vn, Inc.)
 
Omni Global Technologies, Inc. (“OMNI” or the "Company") was originally formed on September 15, 1995 as Interactive Processing, Inc., a Nevada corporation, to market high-tech consumer electronics through television home-shopping networks, retail stores, catalog companies and their website remotecontrols.com. In March 1999, the Company changed its name to Worldtradeshow.com, Inc. In April, 1999, the Company acquired intellectual property rights to a database and business plan and significantly changed its business plan to develop tradeshow software and market both physical and virtual tradeshow space through the Company's website.
 
The Company was dormant from October 2008 through May 15, 2016 until it was placed under the control of a Receiver in Nevada’s Eighth Judicial District pursuant to #A14- 715484-P. Substantially all of the liabilities that have been outstanding since October 2008 are expected to be legally discharged by the Court, but the discharge has not occurred as of the date of this Report. As a result, all liabilities outstanding as of April 30, 2009 have been carried over to the April 30, 2017 balance sheet.
 
Reverse Split and Name Change
 
On November 18, 2016, we effected a 1 for 150 reverse split and changed our name from Business.vn, Inc. to Omni Global Technologies, Inc., and the Company’s trading symbol changed from “BVNI” to “OMGT”. Under the guidelines of Staff Accounting Bulletin 4c, a capital structure change such as a stock split that occurs after the date of the most recent balance sheet must be given retroactive effect in the balance sheet. Accordingly, all references to the numbers of Common Shares and per share data in the accompanying financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this reverse split on a retroactive basis, unless indicated otherwise. As of April 30, 2017 we had 20,351,422 shares outstanding.
SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT 
 
From the period from May 15, 2016 through March 22, 2017 we were under the control of a court appointed Receiver. During that period the Receiver ran the Company and incurred expenses to maintain its status as public company and to locate a potential buyer for the Company. On May 23, 2017 the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with JOJ Holdings (the “Purchaser”, LLC maintaining an address at 53 Calle Palmeras, San Juan Puerto Rico. Under the terms of the SPA, the Purchaser agreed to purchase 20,000,000 of our $0.001 par value common stock; and to assume the liability of a judgement creditor in the amount of $25,690.41. Additionally, and concurrent with the signing of the SPA by the Company; the Receiver resigned from the Company, and the Purchaser elected Olivia Funk as the sole officer and director of the Company. The $150,000 received at closing was distributed by an escrow agent and was used to cover Receiver expenses incurred during the receivership period, and other company expenses. All $150,000 was disbursed prior to April 30, 2017. Therefore, the Company which began the year with no cash, ended up with no cash as on hand as of its April 30, 2017 balance sheet date.
