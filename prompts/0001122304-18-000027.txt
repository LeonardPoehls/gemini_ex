Item 1. Business
General
We are one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits companies, serving an estimated 37.9 million people. We have the information and resources to help our members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make better informed decisions about their health care. We offer a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental, behavioral health, group life and disability plans, medical management capabilities, Medicaid health care management services, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, workers' compensation administrative services and health information technology (“HIT”) products and services. Our customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers (“providers”), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. On November 1, 2017, we sold our domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses to Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company (“HLAIC”). 
Significant Transactions
Proposed Acquisition by CVS Health
On December 3, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement (the “CVS Merger Agreement”) under which CVS Health Corporation (“CVS Health”) will acquire all of our outstanding shares for a combination of cash and stock. Under terms of the agreement, our shareholders will receive $145 in cash and 0.8378 of a CVS Health common share for each of our common shares. The proposed transaction (the “CVS Health Transaction”) is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval and adoption of the CVS Merger Agreement by our shareholders, the approval of the issuance of CVS Health shares in the transaction by CVS Health stockholders, the expiration of the federal Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust waiting period and approvals of certain state departments of insurance and other regulators. On February 1, 2018, Aetna and CVS Health each received a request for additional information (also known as a “second request”) from the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) in connection with the DOJ’s review of the transactions contemplated by the CVS Merger Agreement. The CVS Health Transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2018. 
Divestiture of Domestic Group Life Insurance, Group Disability Insurance, and Absence Management Businesses
On November 1, 2017, we completed the sale of a substantial portion of our Group Insurance segment consisting of our domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses (the “Group Insurance sale”) to HLAIC for cash consideration of $1.45 billion. The transaction was accomplished through an indemnity reinsurance arrangement under which HLAIC contractually assumed certain of our policyholder liabilities and obligations, although we remain directly obligated to policyholders. Assets related to and supporting the reinsured life and disability insurance policies were transferred to a trust established by HLAIC for our benefit, and we recorded a reinsurance receivable from HLAIC. The sale is expected to result in an after-tax gain of approximately $710 million ($1.1 billion pre-tax), a significant portion of which has been deferred and will be amortized into earnings: (i) over the remaining contract period (estimated to be approximately 3 years) in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided for the prospective reinsurance portion of the gain; and (ii) as we recover amounts due from HLAIC over a period estimated to be approximately 30 years for the retrospective reinsurance portion of the gain.
Terminated Acquisition of Humana and Terminated Divestiture to Molina
On July 2, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement (the “Humana Merger Agreement”) to acquire Humana Inc. (“Humana”). On July 21, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and certain state attorneys general filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (the “District Court”) against us and Humana charging that our acquisition of Humana (the “Humana Transaction”) would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and seeking a permanent injunction to prevent Aetna from acquiring Humana. On January 23, 2017, the District Court granted the DOJ’s request to enjoin the Humana Transaction.

On February 14, 2017, Aetna and Humana entered into a mutual termination agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) pursuant to which the parties thereto (collectively, the “Parties”) agreed to terminate the Humana Merger Agreement, including all schedules and exhibits thereto, and all ancillary agreements contemplated thereby, entered pursuant thereto or entered in connection therewith (other than certain confidentiality agreements) (collectively with the Humana Merger Agreement, the “Transaction Documents”), effective immediately as of February 14, 2017 (the “Termination Date”). Under the Termination Agreement, Aetna agreed to pay Humana the Regulatory Termination Fee (as defined in the Humana Merger Agreement) of $1.0 billion in cash in full satisfaction of any amounts required to be paid by Aetna under the Humana Merger Agreement. The Parties also agreed to release each other from any and all liability, claims, rights, actions, causes of action, suits, liens, obligations, accounts, debts, demands, agreements, promises, liabilities, controversies, costs, charges, damages, expenses and fees, however arising, in connection with, arising out of or related to the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated therein or thereby or certain related matters. We paid Humana the Regulatory Termination Fee on February 16, 2017 and recorded the expense in general and administrative expenses. We funded that payment with the proceeds of the 2016 senior notes (as defined below).
In June 2016, we issued $13.0 billion of senior notes to partially fund the Humana Transaction (collectively, the “2016 senior notes”). In accordance with the terms of the 2016 senior notes, on February 14, 2017, we issued a notice of redemption for $10.2 billion aggregate principal amount of certain of the 2016 senior notes (collectively, the “Special Mandatory Redemption Notes”) at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of those notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. We redeemed the Special Mandatory Redemption Notes on March 16, 2017, and we funded the redemption with the proceeds of the 2016 senior notes. As a result of the redemption of the Special Mandatory Redemption Notes, we recognized on a pretax basis in our net income during the year ended December 31, 2017 a loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt of $192 million and a realized capital loss for the remaining unamortized effective portion of the related hedge loss of $323 million that was previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
In order to address the DOJ’s perceived competitive concerns regarding Medicare Advantage relating to the Humana Transaction, on August 2, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement (the “Aetna APA”) to sell for cash to Molina Healthcare, Inc. (“Molina”) certain of our Medicare Advantage assets. On February 14, 2017, Aetna and Molina entered into a Termination Agreement (the “APA Termination Agreement”) pursuant to which Aetna terminated the Aetna APA, including all schedules and exhibits thereto, and all ancillary agreements contemplated thereby or entered pursuant thereto. Under the APA Termination Agreement, Aetna agreed to pay Molina in cash (a) a termination fee of $53 million and (b) approximately 70% of Molina’s transaction costs. We paid Molina the termination fee on February 16, 2017 and the applicable transaction costs of $7 million on February 27, 2017 and recorded the expense in general and administrative expenses. The payments were funded with the proceeds of the 2016 senior notes.
Heath Care Reform
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended, collectively, the “ACA”) has made broad-based changes to the U.S. health care system. We anticipate continued efforts in 2018 and beyond to modify, repeal or replace the ACA, and the future of the ACA is uncertain. We expect aspects of the ACA and/or their implementation or enforcement, including the January 2018 suspension of the ACA’s industry-wide health insurer fee (the “HIF”) for 2019, and uncertainty about the future of the ACA to continue to significantly impact our business operations and operating results, including our pricing and our medical benefit ratios (“MBRs”).
The ACA has presented us with business opportunities, but also with significant financial and regulatory challenges. Most of the ACA’s key components were phased in during or prior to 2014, and the ACA’s temporary Reinsurance and Risk Corridor programs expired at the end of 2016. The effects of existing provisions of the ACA are reflected in our operating results. If the ACA is not amended, repealed or replaced, certain of its components will continue to be phased in until 2022.
It may be particularly challenging for us to include all of our portion of the industry-wide $14.3 billion 2018 HIF in our premium rates beginning with 2017 medical customer renewals that have member months in 2018 because of the temporary suspension of the HIF for 2017 or in our premium rates for other years following a year for which the HIF is suspended.
In October 2017, the federal government announced that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) will curtail payments related to the Cost-Sharing Subsidy program. While the details regarding implementation of this new policy are not yet finalized, and it is the subject of pending litigation, we do not anticipate a material impact to our financial statements as a result of this action.
The federal and state governments also continue to enact and seriously consider many other broad-based legislative and regulatory proposals that have had a material impact on or could materially impact various aspects of the health care and related benefits system. We cannot predict whether pending or future federal or state legislative or regulatory activity or court 
Page 5

proceedings, including Federal budget negotiations and future U.S. Congressional appropriations, will change various aspects of the health care and related benefits system or the ACA or the implementation and/or enforcement of the ACA or the impact those changes will have on our business operations or operating results, but the effects could be materially adverse.
For additional information on federal and state health care reform, including the ACA, refer to “Regulatory Environment” of MD&A included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of certain factors that may cause our actual results to differ from currently anticipated results in connection with health care reform, see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Reportable Segments
Our operations are conducted in three business segments: Health Care, Group Insurance and Large Case Pensions. We derive our revenues primarily from insurance premiums, administrative service fees, net investment income and other revenue. Refer to MD&A included in Part II, Item 7 and Note 18 “Segment Information” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our business segments, including revenue and profit information for each of our business segments and revenue and asset information about geographic areas. The following is a description of each of our business segments.
Health Care Segment
Products and Services
We refer to insurance products (where we assume all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “Insured” and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk of medical and dental care costs) as “ASC.” Health Care products and services consist of the following:

• | Commercial Medical: We offer point-of-service (“POS”), preferred provider organization (“PPO”), health maintenance organization (“HMO”) and indemnity benefit (“Indemnity”) plans. Our Commercial medical products also include health savings accounts (“HSAs”) and Aetna HealthFund®, consumer-directed health plans that combine traditional POS or PPO and/or dental coverage, subject to a deductible, with an accumulating benefit account (which may be funded by the plan sponsor and/or the member in the case of HSAs). Our principal products and services are targeted specifically to large multi-site national, mid-sized and small employers, individual insureds and expatriates. We no longer sell individual Commercial products, and we exited the individual Public Exchanges in 2018. 


• | Government Medical: In select geographies, we offer Medicare Advantage plans, Medicare Supplement plans and prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries; participate in Medicaid and subsidized Children's Health Insurance Programs (“CHIP”); and participate in demonstration projects for members who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (“Duals”). These Government products are further described below:


• | Medicare: Through annual contracts with CMS, we offer HMO and PPO products for eligible individuals in certain geographic areas through the Medicare Advantage program. Members typically receive enhanced benefits over Original Medicare fee-for-service coverage, including reduced cost-sharing for preventive care, vision and other services. We offered network-based HMO and/or PPO plans in 1,213 counties in 40 states and Washington, D.C. in 2017. We are expanding to 1,317 counties in 40 states and Washington, D.C. in 2018. We are a national provider of the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program (“PDP”) in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. to both individuals and employer groups. All Medicare eligible individuals are eligible to participate in this voluntary prescription drug plan. Members typically receive coverage for certain prescription drugs, usually subject to a deductible, co-insurance and/or co-payment. For certain qualifying employer groups, we offer our Medicare PPO products nationally. When combined with our PDP product, these national PPO plans form an integrated national fully-insured Medicare product for employers that provides medical and pharmacy benefits. 


• | Medicare Supplement: For certain Medicare eligible members, we offer supplemental coverage for certain health care costs not covered by Original Medicare. The products included in our Medicare Supplement portfolio help to cover some of the gaps in Original Medicare, and include coverage for Medicare deductibles and coinsurance amounts. We offered a wide selection of Medicare Supplement products in 49 states and Washington, D.C. in 2017.


• | Medicaid and CHIP: We offer health care management services to individuals eligible for Medicaid and CHIP under multi-year contracts with government agencies in various states that are subject to annual appropriations. CHIP are state-subsidized insurance programs that provide benefits for families with uninsured children. We offered these services on an Insured or ASC basis in 16 states in 2017. 


• | Duals: We provide health coverage to beneficiaries who are dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid coverage. These members must meet certain income and resource requirements in order to qualify for this 

Page 6

coverage. We coordinate 100% of the care for these members and may provide them with additional services in order to manage their health care costs. During 2017, we offered services on an Insured basis to members who were dually eligible in four states under demonstration projects.

• | Dental: We offer managed dental plans on an Insured and ASC basis. We are one of the nation's largest providers of dental coverage, based on membership at December 31, 2017. 


• | Behavioral Health: Our behavioral health and employee assistance products provide members who experience stress, depression and other types of mental health related illness with integrated behavioral health benefit administration, access to a network of providers and innovative wellness programs. We provide customized behavioral health solutions to members in all 50 states. 


• | Stop Loss: We offer medical stop loss insurance coverage for certain employers who elect to self-insure their health benefits. Under this product, we assume risk for costs associated with large individual claims and/or aggregate loss experience within an employer's plan above a pre-set annual threshold. 


• | Provider Network Access (“First Health” and “Cofinity”): Through our First Health and Cofinity products, we provide access to health care provider networks to other insurance companies, third-party administrators, health plans and employers. First Health products are marketed nationally, while Cofinity products are marketed in certain states.


• | Aetna VisionSM Preferred: We offer vision benefits that provide members with access to one of the largest vision networks in the U.S. The Aetna Vision Preferred program can be customized with a wide range of benefit levels and co-payments. 


• | Workers' Compensation Administrative Services: Our workers’ compensation administrative services products and services consist of fee-based, managed care services, such as provider network access, cost containment services, pharmacy benefit management, durable medical equipment and ancillary services, and care management services to underwriters and administrators of workers’ compensation insurance.


• | Consumer Health and Services: We have a portfolio of products and services aimed at creating an holistic and integrated approach to individual health and wellness. These products and services complement our Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid products and enable enhanced service delivery to and experience for our customers:


• | Pharmacy: We offer pharmacy benefit management services and specialty and home delivery pharmacy services. Our pharmacy fulfillment services are provided to our Commercial and Medicare members through Aetna Specialty Pharmacy (“ASP”) and Aetna Rx Home Delivery®. ASP dispenses specialty medications and offers certain support services associated with specialty medications. Specialty medications include injectable or infused medications that may not be readily available at local pharmacies. Aetna Rx Home Delivery® provides home delivery prescription drug services. We also perform various pharmacy benefit management services for Aetna pharmacy customers consisting of: product development, Commercial formulary management, pharmacy rebate contracting and administration, sales and account management and precertification programs. CaremarkPCS Health, L.L.C. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of CVS Health) performs the administration of selected functions for our retail pharmacy network contracting and claims administration; home delivery and specialty pharmacy order fulfillment and inventory purchasing and management; and certain administrative services. Other suppliers also provide certain pharmacy benefit management services. 


• | Advanced Provider Models (“APM”): We are focused on growing membership in our medical products through provider collaborations that are designed to lower medical costs for us and our customers and make our products more affordable. These collaboration models include joint ventures and accountable care organizations (“ACOs”). We offer a suite of solutions designed to facilitate delivery system reform and help reduce the cost of care by enabling population health management for providers. Our APM products facilitate providers changing their business model from episodic acute care to patient population management which allows them to convert from volume-based reimbursement to value-based reimbursement. Our APM products deploy Aetna's population health management assets to collaborate with providers in new ways to improve the quality and efficiency of care for all patients, whether they are Aetna members or members of other payors. In 2017, we continued expanding our offering of APM products and services to employers and individuals in more geographic areas to create mutually beneficial relationships with providers through a variety of methods, including alignment of financial incentives based on cost and quality, implementation of innovative HIT and deploying leading care management programs. Our APM relationships include joint ventures with Allina Health, Banner Health Network, Inova Health System, Sutter Health, and Texas Health Resources.

• | ActiveHealth Management: Through the use of our patented CareEngine® system, our ActiveHealth Management products provide evidence-based medical management and data analytics products and services to a broad range of customers, including health plans, employers and others. ActiveHealth Management also is a key component of our APM solutions. 


• | Consumer: We believe the role of the consumer in health care is changing and that consumers will become the primary decision makers when it comes to choosing their health-related benefits. As a result, we are developing a portfolio of products and tools, including bswift and PayFlex, that are designed for a retail model in the health benefits industry that is consumer-centric, affordable and convenient. Our Consumer business is focusing on developing a simplified, integrated offering to help consumers navigate the health care system and manage their health care costs. 


▪ | bswift: bswift provides benefit administration technology and services to employers nationwide, streamlining the benefits process. bswift's technology also provides the shopping, buying and enrolling experience for public health insurance exchanges (“Public Exchanges”), private health insurance exchanges (“Private Exchanges” and together with Public Exchanges “Insurance Exchanges”) and individuals.


▪ | PayFlex: PayFlex provides services to employers, their employees, and their former employees in the areas of tax-advantaged account reimbursement administration (flexible spending, health reimbursement, health savings, transit and parking), Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“COBRA”) administration and special-member billing administration.

Provider Networks 
We contract with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers for services they provide to our members. The health care providers who participate in our networks are independent contractors and are neither our employees nor our agents, except for providers who work in our home delivery and specialty pharmacy facilities.
We use a variety of techniques designed to help encourage appropriate utilization of medical services (“utilization”) and maintain affordability of quality coverage. In addition to contracts with health care providers for negotiated rates of reimbursement, these techniques include creating risk sharing arrangements that align economic incentives with our providers, the development and implementation of guidelines for the appropriate utilization of medical services and the provision of data to providers to enable them to improve health care quality.
At December 31, 2017, Aetna's underlying nationwide provider network had approximately 1.2 million participating health care providers, including over 683,000 primary care and specialist physicians and approximately 5,700 hospitals. 

• | Advanced Provider Models: We collaborate with hospitals and other providers through our APM products. Our arrangements focus on high value narrow network solutions to provide high-quality, low-cost options in local geographies. We are able to help enhance our relationships with hospitals and other providers through a variety of methods, including a re-alignment of financial incentives for providing high quality care, total cost management initiatives and risk sharing arrangements. 


• | Primary Care Physicians: We compensate primary care physicians (“PCPs”) participating in our networks on both a fee-for-service and capitated basis, with capitation generally limited to HMO products in certain geographic areas and representing approximately 3 percent of health care costs in 2017 and 4 percent in both 2016 and 2015. In a fee-for-service arrangement, physicians are paid for health care services provided to the member based upon a set fee for the services provided. Under a capitation arrangement, physicians receive a monthly fixed fee for each member, regardless of the volume of health care services provided to the member. In some cases, PCPs who are paid on a fee-for-service or capitated basis also receive additional incentive fees if certain performance metrics are attained. 


• | Specialist Physicians: Specialist physicians participating in our networks are generally reimbursed at contracted rates per visit or per procedure.


• | Hospitals: We typically enter into contracts with hospitals that provide for per-day and/or per-case rates, often with fixed rates for ambulatory, surgery and emergency room services. We also have hospital contracts that provide for reimbursement based on a percentage of the charges billed by the hospital. Our medical plans generally require notification of elective hospital admissions, and we monitor the length of hospital stays. Physicians who participate in our networks generally admit their patients in network-based products to participating hospitals using referral procedures that direct the hospital to contact our patient management unit in order to confirm the patient's membership status and facilitate the patient management process. This unit also assists members and providers with related 

Page 8

activities, including, if necessary, the subsequent transition to the home environment and home care. Case management assistance for complex cases is provided by a special unit.

• | Other Providers: Laboratory, imaging, urgent care and other freestanding health facility providers are generally paid under fee-for-service arrangements, except for certain laboratory services.

Quality Assessment 
CMS uses a 5-star rating system to monitor plans and ensure that they meet CMS's quality standards. CMS uses this rating system to provide Medicare beneficiaries with a tool that they can use to compare the overall quality of care and level of customer service of companies that provide Medicare health care and drug plans. The rating system considers a variety of measures adopted by CMS, including quality of preventative services, chronic illness management and overall customer satisfaction. Refer to “Pricing” below in this Item 1 for further discussion of our star ratings.
We seek Health Plan accreditation for our Aetna HMO plans from the National Committee for Quality Assurance (the “NCQA”), a national organization established to review the quality and medical management systems of health care plans. Health care plans seeking accreditation must pass a rigorous, comprehensive review and must annually report on their performance. 
Aetna Life Insurance Company ("ALIC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aetna, has received nationwide NCQA PPO Health Plan accreditation, through December 13, 2019. As of December 31, 2017, all of our Aetna Health Inc. Commercial HMO and ALIC PPO members who were eligible participated in HMOs or PPOs that are accredited by the NCQA. 
NCQA and URAC (formally known as American Accreditation HealthCare Commission, Inc.), are national organizations founded to establish standards for the health care industry. Purchasers and consumers look to NCQA’s and URAC's accreditation and certification as an indication that a health care organization has the necessary structures and processes to promote high-quality care and preserve patient rights. In addition, regulators in over 80% of the states recognize NCQA's accreditation and certification standards.
Our provider selection and credentialing/re-credentialing policies and procedures are consistent with NCQA and URAC, as well as state and federal, requirements. In addition, we are certified under the NCQA Credentials Verification Organization (“CVO”) certification program for all certification options through January 5, 2019. Our URAC CVO accreditation is valid through October 1, 2018.
Our quality assessment programs for contracted providers who participate in our networks begin with the initial review of health care practitioners. Practitioners' licenses and education are verified, and their work history is collected by us or in some cases by the practitioner's affiliated group or organization. We generally require participating hospitals to be certified by CMS or accredited by the Joint Commission, the American Osteopathic Association, or Det Norske Veritas Healthcare.
We also offer quality and outcome measurement programs, quality improvement programs, and health care data analysis systems to providers and purchasers of health care services.
Principal Markets and Sales
Our medical membership is dispersed throughout the United States, and we serve a limited number of members in certain countries outside the United States. Refer to Note 18 “Segment Information” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our foreign customers. We offer a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, many of which are available nationwide. Depending on the product, we market to a range of customers including employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, providers, governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates.

Additional information on Health Care's membership is included in the “Healthcare - Membership” section of the MD&A included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We market both Commercial Insured and ASC products and services primarily to employers that sponsor our products (also called “plan sponsors”) for the benefit of their employees and their employees' dependents. Frequently, larger employers offer employees a choice among coverage options, from which the employee makes his or her selection during a designated annual open enrollment period. Typically, employers pay all of the monthly premiums to us and, through payroll deductions, obtain reimbursement from employees for a percentage of the premiums that is determined by each employer. We also sold Commercial Insured plans directly to individual consumers in a number of states, including through Public Exchanges. We no longer sell individual Commercial products, and we exited the individual Public Exchanges in 2018. Some Health Care products are sold directly to employees of employer groups on a fully employee-funded basis. In some cases, we bill the covered individual directly. 
We offer Insured Medicare coverage on an individual basis as well as through employer groups to their retirees. Medicaid and CHIP members are enrolled on an individual basis. We also offer Insured health care coverage to members who are dually-eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. 
Health Care products are sold through our sales personnel; through independent brokers, agents and consultants who assist in the production and servicing of business; and Private Exchanges. For large plan sponsors, independent consultants and brokers are frequently involved in employer health plan selection decisions and sales. In some instances, we may pay commissions, fees and other amounts to brokers, agents, consultants and sales representatives who place business with us. In certain cases, our customer pays the broker for services rendered, and we may facilitate that arrangement by collecting the funds from the customer and transmitting them to the broker. We support our marketing and sales efforts with an advertising program that may include television, radio, billboards, print media and social media, supplemented by market research and direct marketing efforts.
Pricing 
For Commercial Insured plans, contracts containing the pricing and other terms of the relationship are generally established in advance of the policy period and typically have a duration of one year. Fees under our ASC plans are generally fixed for a period of one year.
We use prospective rating methodologies in determining the premium rates charged to the majority of employer groups, and we also use retrospective rating methodologies for a limited number of groups. Premium rates for customers with more than approximately 125 employees generally take into consideration the individual plan sponsor's historical and anticipated claim experience where permitted by law. Some states may prohibit the use of one or more of these rating methods for some customers, such as small employer groups, or all customers.
Under prospective rating, a fixed premium rate is determined at the beginning of the policy period. We typically cannot recover unanticipated increases in health care costs in the current policy period; however, we may consider prior experience for a product in the aggregate or for a specific customer, among other factors, in determining premium rates for future policy periods. Where required by state laws, premium rates are filed and approved by state regulators prior to contract inception. Our future operating results could be adversely affected if the premium rates we request are not approved or are adjusted downward or their approval is delayed by state or federal regulators. 
Page 10

Under retrospective rating, we determine a premium rate at the beginning of the policy period. After the policy period has ended, the actual claim and cost experience is reviewed. If the actual claim costs and other expenses are less than expected, we may issue a refund to the plan sponsor based on this favorable experience. If the experience is unfavorable, in certain instances we may recover the resulting deficit through contractual provisions or consider the deficit in setting future premium levels. However, we may not recover the deficit if a plan sponsor elects to terminate coverage. Retrospective rating may be used for Commercial Insured plans that cover more than approximately 300 lives.
We have Medicare Advantage and PDP contracts with CMS to provide HMO, PPO and prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries in certain geographic areas. Under these annual contracts, CMS pays us a fixed capitation payment and/or a portion of the premium, both of which are based on membership and adjusted for demographic and health risk factors. CMS also considers inflation, changes in utilization patterns and average per capita fee-for-service Medicare costs in the calculation of the fixed capitation payment or premium. Our PDP contracts also provide a risk-sharing arrangement with CMS to limit our exposure to unfavorable expenses or benefit from favorable expenses. Amounts payable to us under the Medicare arrangements are subject to annual revision by CMS, and we elect to participate in each Medicare service area or region on an annual basis. Premiums paid to us for Medicare products are subject to federal government reviews and audits, which can result, and have resulted, in retroactive and prospective premium adjustments and refunds to the government and/or members. In addition to payments received from CMS, some of our Medicare Advantage products and all of our PDP products require a supplemental premium to be paid by the member or sponsoring employer. In some cases these supplemental premiums are adjusted based on the member's income and asset levels. Compared to Commercial products, Medicare contracts generate higher per member per month revenues and health care costs. 
The ACA ties a portion of each Medicare Advantage plan’s reimbursement to the plan’s “star ratings.” Since 2015, plans must have a star rating of four or higher (out of five) to qualify for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates. CMS released our 2018 star ratings in October 2017. Our 2018 star ratings will be used to determine which of our Medicare Advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2019. Based on our membership at December 31, 2017, 87% of our Medicare Advantage members were in plans with 2018 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, compared to 92% of our Medicare Advantage members being in plans with 2017 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on our membership at December 31, 2016.
Rates for our Medicare Supplement products are regulated at the state level and vary by state and plan.
Under our Insured Medicaid contracts, state government agencies pay us fixed monthly rates per member that vary by state, line of business and demographics; and we arrange, pay for and manage health care services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries. These rates are subject to change by each state, and, in some instances, provide for adjustment for health risk factors. CMS requires these rates to be actuarially sound. We also receive fees from our customers where we provide services under ASC Medicaid contracts. Our ASC Medicaid contracts generally are for periods of more than one year, and certain of them contain performance incentives and limited financial risk sharing with respect to certain medical, financial and operational metrics. Under these arrangements, performance is evaluated annually, with associated financial incentive opportunities, and our financial risk share obligations are typically limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to us. Payments to us under our Medicaid contracts are subject to the annual appropriation process in the applicable state.
Under our Duals contracts, the rate setting process is generally established by CMS in partnership with the state government agency participating in the demonstration project. Both CMS and the state government agency may seek premium and other refunds under certain circumstances, including if we fail to comply with CMS regulations or other contractual requirements.
We offer HMO and consumer-directed medical and dental plans to federal employees under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program. Premium rates and fees for those plans are subject to federal government review and audit, which can result, and have resulted, in retroactive and prospective premium and fee adjustments and refunds to the government and/or members. 
Beginning in 2014, the ACA imposed significant new industry-wide fees, assessments and taxes. In December 2015, the Consolidated Appropriation Act was enacted, which included a one year suspension of the HIF for 2017. In January 2018, the HIF was suspended for 2019. Refer to Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the ACA fees, assessments and taxes. Our goal is to collect in premiums and fees or solve for all of these estimated fees, assessments and taxes.
Competition
The health care benefits industry is highly competitive, primarily due to a large number of for-profit and not-for-profit competitors, our competitors' marketing and pricing, and a proliferation of competing products, including new products that 
Page 11

are continually being introduced into the marketplace. New entrants into the marketplace, as well as consolidation within the industry, have contributed to and are expected to intensify the competitive environment. In addition, the rapid pace of change as the industry evolves towards a consumer-focused retail marketplace, including Public and Private Exchanges, and the increased use of technology to interact with members, providers and customers, increase the risks we currently face from new entrants and disruptive actions by existing competitors compared to prior periods. References to competitors and other companies throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the information incorporated herein by reference, are for illustrative or comparison purposes only and do not indicate that these companies are our only competitors or are our closest competitors.
We believe that the significant factors that distinguish competing health plans include the perceived overall quality (including accreditation status), quality of service, comprehensiveness of coverage, cost (including premium rates, provider discounts and member out-of-pocket costs), product design, financial stability and ratings, breadth and quality of provider networks, ability to offer different provider network options, providers available in such networks, and quality of member support and care management programs. We believe that we are competitive on each of these factors. Our ability to increase the number of persons covered by our plans or to increase our revenues is affected by our ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors on these factors. Competition may also affect the availability of services from health care providers, including primary care physicians, specialists and hospitals.
Our Insured products compete with local and regional health care benefits plans, health care benefits and other plans sponsored by other large commercial health care benefit insurance companies, health system owned health plans, new entrants into the marketplace and numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. Our largest competitor in our Medicare products is Original Medicare. Additional competitors include other types of medical and dental provider organizations, various specialty service providers (including pharmacy benefit management services providers), health care consultants, financial services companies, integrated health care delivery organizations (networks of providers who also coordinate administrative services for and assume insurance risk of their members), third party administrators, HIT companies and, for certain plans, programs sponsored by the federal or state governments. Emerging competitors include start up health care benefits plans, technology companies, provider-owned health plans, new joint ventures (including not-for-profit joint ventures among firms from multiple industries), technology firms, financial services firms that are distributing competing products on their proprietary Private Exchanges, and consulting firms that are distributing competing products on their proprietary Private Exchanges, as well as non-traditional distributors such as retail companies. Our ability to increase the number of persons enrolled in our Insured products also is affected by the desire and ability of employers to self-fund their health coverage.
Our ASC plans compete primarily with other large commercial health care benefit companies, numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and third-party administrators.
Our international products compete with local, global and U.S. based health plans and commercial health care benefit insurance companies, many of whom have a longer operating history and better brand recognition and greater marketplace presence in one or more geographies.
The provider solutions and HIT marketplaces and provider solutions and HIT products are evolving rapidly. We compete for provider solutions and HIT business with other large health plans and commercial health care benefit insurance companies as well as information technology companies and companies that specialize in provider solutions and HIT. Many of our information technology product competitors have longer operating histories, better brand recognition, greater marketplace presence and more experience in developing innovative products. 
In addition to competitive pressures affecting our ability to obtain new customers or retain existing customers, our membership has been and may continue to be adversely affected by adverse and/or uncertain economic conditions and reductions in workforce by existing customers due to adverse and/or uncertain general economic conditions, especially in the U.S. and industries where our membership is concentrated. 
Reinsurance
We currently have several reinsurance agreements with non-affiliated insurers that relate to Health Care insurance policies. We entered into these contracts to reduce the risk of catastrophic losses which in turn reduces our capital and surplus requirements. We frequently evaluate reinsurance opportunities and refine our reinsurance and risk management strategies on a regular basis.

Group Insurance Segment
On November 1, 2017, we completed the sale of a substantial portion of our Group Insurance segment consisting of our domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses to HLAIC for cash consideration of $1.45 billion. The transaction was accomplished through an indemnity reinsurance arrangement under which HLAIC contractually assumed certain of our policyholder liabilities and obligations, although we remain directly obligated to policyholders. Assets related to and supporting the reinsured life and disability insurance policies were transferred to a trust established by HLAIC for our benefit, and we recorded a reinsurance receivable from HLAIC.
Refer to Note 3 “Acquisition, Divestiture, Terminated Acquisition and Terminated Divestiture” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
Principal Products
Group Insurance products consist primarily of the following:

• | Life Insurance: Our life insurance products principally consist of group term life insurance, the amounts of which may be fixed or linked to individual employee wage levels. We also offer voluntary spouse and dependent term life insurance, and group universal life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance. We offer life insurance products on an Insured basis. 


• | Disability Insurance: Our Disability products provide employee income replacement benefits for both short-term and long-term disability (and products which combine both). Similar to Health Care products, we offer disability benefits on both an Insured and employer-funded basis. We also provide absence management services to employers, including short-term and long-term disability administration and leave management. 


• | Long-Term Care Insurance: Our Long-Term Care Insurance products provide benefits to cover the cost of care in private home settings, adult day care, assisted living or nursing facilities. We no longer solicit or accept new long-term care customers. Long-term care benefits were offered primarily on an Insured basis. The product was available on both a service reimbursement and disability basis. 

Principal Markets and Sales
We offer our Group Insurance products in 49 states as well as Washington, D.C., Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada. Depending on the product, we market to a range of customers from small employer groups to large, multi-site and/or multi-state employer programs.
We market Group Insurance products and services primarily to employers that sponsor our products for the benefit of their employees and their employees' dependents. Frequently, employers offer employees a choice of benefits, from which the employee makes his or her selection during a designated annual open enrollment period. Typically, employers pay all of the monthly premiums to us and, through payroll deductions, obtain reimbursement from employees for a percentage of the premiums that is determined by each employer. Some Group Insurance products are sold directly to employees of employer groups on a fully employee-funded basis. In some cases, we bill the covered individual directly.
Group Insurance products are sold through our sales personnel, as well as through independent brokers, agents and consultants who assist in the production and servicing of business. For large plan sponsors, independent consultants and brokers are frequently involved in employer plan selection decisions and sales. We pay commissions, fees and other amounts to brokers, agents, consultants and sales representatives who place business with us. We support our marketing and sales efforts with an advertising program that may include direct marketing efforts as well as television, radio, billboards, print media and social media, supplemented by market research.
Pricing
For Insured and employer-funded Group Insurance plans, employer group contracts containing the pricing and other terms of the relationship are generally established in advance of the policy or contract period. We use prospective and retrospective rating methodologies to determine the premium rates charged to employer groups on our Insured products. Contracts are typically offered with rate guarantees that generally range from one to five years.
Under prospective rating, a fixed premium rate is determined at the beginning of the policy period. We typically cannot recover unanticipated increases in mortality or morbidity costs in the current policy period; however, we may consider prior experience for a product in the aggregate or for a specific customer, among other factors, in determining premium rates for future policy periods.
Page 13

Under retrospective rating, we determine a premium rate at the beginning of the policy period. After the policy period has ended, the actual claim and cost experience is reviewed. If the actual claim costs and other expenses are less than expected, we may issue a refund to the plan sponsor based on this favorable experience. If the experience is unfavorable, we consider the deficit in setting future premium levels, and in certain instances, we may recover the deficit through contractual provisions such as offsets against refund credits that develop for future policy periods. However, we may not recover the deficit if a plan sponsor elects to terminate coverage. Retrospective rating is most often used for Insured plans that cover more than approximately 3,000 lives.
Competition
For the group insurance industry, we believe that the significant factors that distinguish competing companies are cost, quality of service, financial strength of the insurer, comprehensiveness of coverage, and product array and design. We believe we are reasonably competitive on each of these factors; however, some of our competitors have greater scale, financial and other resources, better brand recognition and lower expenses. The group life and group disability marketplaces remain highly competitive.
Reinsurance
We currently have several reinsurance agreements with non-affiliated insurers that relate to both life and long-term disability products, including our domestic group life insurance and group disability insurance businesses sold to HLAIC. Certain of our reinsurance arrangements are established on a case-by-case basis, and a subset of our reinsurance agreements cover closed blocks of business and canceled cases. We also have a reinsurance arrangement to mitigate long-term disability claim severity risk at the individual claim level, and another reinsurance arrangement that provides a limited degree of catastrophic risk protection for certain of our life products.
Large Case Pensions Segment
Principal Products
Large Case Pensions manages a variety of retirement products (including pension and annuity products) primarily for tax-qualified pension plans. We do not actively market Large Case Pensions products, but continue to accept deposits from existing customers and manage the run-off of our existing business. Contracts provide non-guaranteed, experience-rated and guaranteed investment options through general and separate account products. Large Case Pensions products that use separate accounts provide contract holders with a vehicle for investments under which the contract holders primarily assume the investment risk. Large Case Pensions earns a management fee on these separate accounts.
In 1993, we discontinued our fully-guaranteed Large Case Pensions products. Refer to Note 19 “Discontinued Products” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Employees
We had approximately 47,950 employees at December 31, 2017. 
Customer Concentration
The U.S. federal government is a significant customer of both the Health Care segment and the Company as described below:

• | Premiums and fees and other revenue paid by the federal government accounted for 36% of the Health Care segment's revenue and 34% of our consolidated total revenue in 2017.


• | Contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals accounted for 87% of our federal government premiums and fees and other revenue, with the balance coming from federal employee-related benefit programs and ACA programs. No other individual customer, in any of our segments, accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated total revenue in 2017. 


• | Our Medicaid products accounted for 14% of our Health Care segment's revenue and 13% of our consolidated total revenue in 2017. However, no individual state government agency accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated total revenue or the Health Care segment's revenue in 2017.

Other than our contracts with CMS, our segments are not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a significant effect on the earnings of a segment. The loss of business from any one, or a few, independent brokers or agents would not have a material adverse effect on our earnings or the earnings of any of our segments. Refer to Note 18 “Segment Information” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
