Item 1. Business.
Overview
8point3 Energy Partners LP is a Delaware limited partnership formed on March 3, 2015, by our general partner pursuant to a joint venture between First Solar and SunPower. We are a limited partnership formed to own, operate and acquire solar energy generation projects. On June 24, 2015, we completed our IPO of 20,000,000 Class A shares. Our Class A shares representing limited partner interests in 8point3 Energy Partners LP are traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “CAFD.” As of November 30, 2017, we owned a 35.5% limited liability interest in OpCo, as well as a controlling non-economic managing member interest in OpCo. As of November 30, 2017, our Sponsors collectively owned 51,000,000 Class B shares in the Partnership, with SunPower and First Solar owning 28,883,075 and 22,116,925 Class B shares, respectively, and together owning a noncontrolling 64.5% limited liability company interest in OpCo.
As of November 30, 2017, our Portfolio consisted of interests in 946 MW of solar energy projects. As of November 30, 2017, we owned interests in ten utility-scale solar energy projects and four C&I solar energy projects, all of which are operational, and a portfolio of residential DG Solar assets. Each utility-scale and C&I solar energy project in our Portfolio sells its energy output under long-term, fixed-price offtake agreements and our residential portfolios are comprised of solar installations which are leased to homeowners under a fixed monthly rate. Our operations comprise one reportable segment containing our Portfolio of solar energy projects. Please read Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16—Segment Information.”
On February 5, 2018, we, our general partner, OpCo and Holdings entered into the Merger Agreement with certain affiliates of Capital Dynamics. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (i) OpCo Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into OpCo (“OpCo Merger 1”) and the separate existence of OpCo Merger Sub 1 will cease and OpCo will continue as the surviving limited liability company of OpCo Merger 1 (the “Initial Surviving LLC”), (ii) OpCo Merger Sub 2 will merge with and into the Initial Surviving LLC (“OpCo Merger 2” and, together with OpCo Merger 1, the “OpCo Mergers”) and the separate existence of OpCo Merger Sub 2 will cease and the Initial Surviving LLC will continue as the surviving limited liability company of OpCo Merger 2 (the “Surviving LLC”), (iii) Partnership Merger Sub will merge with and into the Partnership (the “Partnership Merger” and, together with the OpCo Mergers, the “Mergers”) and the separate existence of Partnership Merger Sub will cease and the Partnership shall continue as the surviving partnership of the Partnership Merger (the “Surviving Partnership” and, together with the Surviving LLC, the “Surviving Entities”), (iv) Holdings will transfer to 8point3 Solar or an affiliate thereof, and 8point3 Solar (or its designated affiliate) will accept, for no consideration, the transfer and delivery of, 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in the General Partner, including all rights and obligations relating thereto and all economic and capital interests therein, and 100% of the issued and outstanding Incentive Distribution Rights (as defined in the OpCo LLC Agreement). 
The Merger Agreement was approved unanimously by the members of our Board, following the approval and recommendation of the Conflicts Committee. Completion of the Mergers is expected to occur, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, in the second or third quarter of 2018.
At the effective time of OpCo Merger 1, the OpCo LLC Agreement shall be amended by Amendment No. 1 to permit a special distribution to the members of OpCo pro rata in accordance with their ownership of common and subordinated units of OpCo, and the Initial Surviving LLC shall make a special distribution in an amount equal to the difference between $1.1 billion and the amount of debt then outstanding to the members of OpCo (the “Special Distribution”). At the effective time of OpCo Merger 2, each issued and outstanding common unit and subordinated unit of OpCo, other than the common units owned by us, will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $12.35 per share, less the amount received in the Special Distribution and as further adjusted pursuant to the Merger Agreement. At the effective time of the Partnership Merger, each issued and outstanding Class A Share will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $12.35 per share, as adjusted pursuant to the Merger Agreement. During the pendency of the Mergers, we intend to make quarterly distributions of $0.2802 per share, which maintains the distribution level at the end of fiscal 2017.
The following diagram depicts a simplified version of our organizational and ownership structure as of November 30, 2017.

Tax Equity Financing
Most of our projects are financed using partnership structures with investors, known as tax equity investors, who can more efficiently monetize the value of the tax benefits, primarily ITCs and accelerated depreciation that support solar energy projects in the United States. These partnership structures usually allocate tax and cash items disproportionately to the share of the project capital contributed by the tax equity investor and OpCo. These partnership structures are designed to effectively allocate project attributes (e.g., tax benefits, cash flows and residual value) to the party best suited to monetize the attributes. Often these partnerships are structured with allocations that change over time or as the tax equity investor realizes its projected return on investment and are known as “flip partnerships.” Partnership allocations vary by project based on specific project characteristics and investor preferences.
For each of the Solar Gen 2 Project, the Lost Hills Blackwell Project, the North Star Project and the Henrietta Project, a modified flip-partnership structure was utilized that distributes available cash on the basis of (i) 51% to the tax equity investor and (ii) 49% to OpCo. For the Stateline Project, a modified flip-partnership structure was utilized that distributes available cash on the basis of (i) 66% to the tax equity investor and (ii) 34% to OpCo.
The flip partnership structures employed on the Kern Project, the Kingbird Project, the Hooper Project, the Macy’s California Project, the Macy’s Maryland Project, the Quinto Project, the RPU Project and the UC Davis Project allocate a certain share of project cash flow to OpCo pursuant to the project-specific distribution waterfall applicable to the project. Pursuant to each of these distribution waterfalls, the tax equity investor is entitled to a monthly or quarterly amount of project cash flow until a specified “flip” point is achieved. After the “flip” point, the cash allocations to OpCo are expected to increase. In addition, upon reaching the flip point, OpCo has a right to purchase the tax equity investor’s interests in the project for an amount that is not less than its fair market value. The H.R. 1 (Pub. L. No. 115-97), informally known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “2017 Tax Act”), which was signed into law December 22, 2017, made certain changes to the US Internal Revenue Code that could affect the timing of the flip point for certain of the Projects noted above. Notably, the decrease in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% decreases the potential tax advantages of depreciation to potential investors.
The Maryland Solar Project Entity has leased the Maryland Solar Project to an affiliate of First Solar, with the lease term expiring on December 31, 2019 (unless terminated earlier pursuant to its terms). Under the arrangement, First Solar’s affiliate is obligated to pay a fixed amount of rent that is set based on the expected operations of the plant. Upon expiration of this lease, we will directly benefit from the operating results of the Maryland Solar Project. Please read Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We rely on a limited number of offtake counterparties and we are exposed to the risk that they are unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to us or that they otherwise terminate their offtake agreements with us.”
Under these tax equity financing structures, a tax equity investor may be entitled to indemnification or to a diversion to it of distributable cash from a project in order to compensate the tax equity investor (i) for a breach of representation, warranty or covenant made to it in connection with its tax equity investment, (ii) for a reduction in or change in allocation of ITCs, tax basis, fair market value or other tax-related matters on which its investment was based or (iii) with respect to tax equity arrangements where the determination of the flip date is based on the tax equity investor achieving a target after-tax internal rate of return, for a delay in achieving the target return (including due to a change in federal tax law that results in a reduction in the applicable corporate tax rate (which could reduce the value of depreciation deductions)), a reduction in available ITCs or a change to available depreciations deductions. Except for indemnification or diversion caused by OpCo or diversions resulting from corporate tax rate reductions (including potentially due to the 2017 Tax Act’s corporate tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%), OpCo is entitled to indemnification under the Omnibus Agreement for payments made to a tax equity investor in respect of indemnification or diversion obligations that arise under clauses (i) or (ii) above.

ROFO Projects
In connection with our IPO, our Sponsors granted us rights of first offer on certain of their solar energy projects that are currently contracted or are expected to be contracted prior to being sold, should our Sponsors decide to sell such projects before June 24, 2020. Due to our higher cost of capital and difficulty in accessing the capital markets on a consistent basis, commencing in fiscal 2016, we and our Sponsors agreed to make several adjustments to the projects subject to the ROFO Agreements, replacing interests in certain projects with alternatives. Later, when certain projects were ultimately offered to us under the ROFO Agreement, we were unable to transact due to these same fiscal constraints. The offered projects were subsequently acquired by third party buyers at purchase prices higher than those offered to us. As a result of such adjustments, we no longer have a right of first offer on any projects developed by First Solar. The SunPower ROFO Agreement includes assets similar to the projects in our Portfolio and represent interests in 304 MW capacity as of November 30, 2017. However, due to the limitations on our ability to acquire projects under the Merger Agreement, in connection with the Conflicts Committee’s and the Board’s approval of the Merger Agreement, we agreed to enter into the Waiver Agreement with SunPower of all the projects subject to the SunPower ROFO Agreement during the pendency of the Merger Agreement. In the event that the Merger Agreement terminates without the closing of the Mergers, the waiver would terminate with respect to all projects subject to the SunPower ROFO Agreement, except, with respect to individual projects still owned by SunPower at the termination of such waiver, such project is either under an exclusivity agreement with a third party or has an offer for purchase from a third party pursuant to which SunPower is in negotiations. Despite the chart detailed below, during the pendency of the Merger Agreement, we do not have a right of first offer on any or all such projects should SunPower decide to sell.
The following table provides a brief description of the SunPower ROFO Projects as of November 30, 2017 (subject to the waiver described above):

These arrangements have multiple potential structures which have differing impacts on our economic ownership. Please read Part I, Item 1, “Business—Tax Equity Financing.” With respect to certain utility-scale solar energy projects, these arrangements may result in our expected economic ownership percentage of such project being not less than 45% at the time of purchase, unless approved by the Partnership. SunPower is also permitted to sell a partial economic interest in the SunPower ROFO Project as part of a tax equity investment in the SunPower ROFO Project.

Utility Projects
Typical Project Agreements
Our Utility Project Entities have entered into agreements that are customary for utility-scale solar energy projects. These include agreements for energy sales, interconnection, construction, equipment supply, O&M services, asset management services and real estate rights, among others. Our Utility Project Entities have also secured necessary and customary project permits.
Power Purchase Agreements.    Our Utility Project Entities have entered into offtake agreements under which each Utility Project Entity generally receives a fixed price over the term of the offtake agreement with respect to 100% of its output, subject in some cases to annual escalations and/or time of delivery adjustments. Such offtake agreements are designed to provide a stable and predictable revenue stream.
Under our Utility Project Entities’ offtake agreements, each party typically has the right to terminate upon written notice ranging from ten to 60 days following the occurrence of an event of default that has not been cured within the applicable cure period, if any. In addition, following an uncured event of default under an offtake agreement by the applicable offtake counterparty, the applicable Utility Project Entity may withhold amounts due to such offtake counterparty, suspend performance, receive payment for damages and, in most cases, receive termination payments from the applicable offtake counterparty or pursue other remedies available at law or in equity. Events of default under these offtake agreements typically include:

• | failure to pay amounts due;


• | bankruptcy proceedings;


• | failure to provide certain credit support;


• | failure to hold necessary licenses or permits; and


• | breach of material obligations.

Our Utility Project Entities’ offtake agreements have certain availability or production requirements, and if such requirements are not met, then in some cases the applicable Utility Project Entity is required to pay the offtake counterparty a specified damages amount. In addition, such failure, in certain cases, may give the offtake counterparty a right to terminate the offtake agreement or reduce the contract quantity. Certain obligations (other than payment obligations) under our offtake agreements may be excused by force majeure events, and in some cases, the offtake agreement may be terminated if any such force majeure event continues for a continuous period of between 12 and 36 months (depending on the offtake agreement).
Interconnection Agreements.    We depend on interconnection and transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the energy from our utility projects. As such, our Utility Project Entities or their affiliates have entered into interconnection agreements with large regional utility companies, local distribution companies or independent system operators, which allow our projects to connect to the energy transmission system or, in some cases, to a distribution system. The interconnection agreements define the cost allocation and schedule for interconnection, as well as any upgrades required to connect the project to the transmission system or distribution system, as applicable.
Construction and Equipment Supply Agreements.    Our Utility Project Entities have entered into construction agreements with qualified contractors and equipment supply agreements with industry leading suppliers, including our Sponsors. In addition to setting forth the terms and conditions of construction or equipment delivery, as applicable, our Utility Project Entities receive system-wide warranties and product warranties for the major equipment pursuant to these construction and equipment supply agreements (which vary in coverage and length by project).
O&M Agreements and Asset Management Agreements.    Our Utility Project Entities and certain other subsidiaries have entered into O&M agreements and AMAs with First Solar or SunPower affiliates, as applicable (except where such persons are otherwise subject to O&M agreements or AMAs with unaffiliated third parties). Under the terms of the O&M agreements and AMAs, such affiliates have agreed to provide a variety of operation, maintenance and asset management services, and certain performance warranties or availability guarantees, to our Utility Project Entities in exchange for fixed annual fees, which are subject to certain adjustments. For a detailed description of the terms of the O&M agreements and AMAs applicable to our projects, please read Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”
17

Real Estate Rights.    Our Utility Project Entities and certain other subsidiaries have secured real property interests and access rights that we believe will allow our utility projects in our Portfolio to operate without material real estate claims until the expiration of the initial terms of applicable offtake agreements.
Our Utility Projects
Henrietta
The Henrietta Project Entity owns the 102 MW Henrietta Project located in Kings County, California. The Henrietta Project achieved commercial operation in October 2016. We indirectly control 100% of the class B membership interests in Henrietta Holdings, the indirect owner of 100% of the limited liability company membership interests of the Henrietta Project Entity. Such class B membership interests in Henrietta Holdings entitle us to a 49% economic interest and initially 1% of the tax allocations and the net income or loss of the Henrietta Project Entity. A subsidiary of Southern Company acts as the class A member of Henrietta Holdings. The class A member owns a 51% economic interest and initially 99% of the tax allocations and the net income or loss of the Henrietta Project Entity. After the Henrietta Project has been operational for approximately fifteen years, the allocation of tax-related items between the class A and class B members of Henrietta Holdings will shift to match the economic interests. An affiliate of the class A member has managerial responsibilities, subject to the class A members’ and the class B members’ approval rights with respect to certain decisions, including expenditures in excess of budgeted amounts, certain sales of assets, execution, termination or amendment of certain contracts and the incurrence of debt. The Henrietta Project is located on leased property pursuant to a ground lease and ancillary beneficial easements executed in August 2015, which provide the Henrietta Project Entity with an initial 31 years of site control and the ability to extend the lease term up to two additional five-year terms.
Hooper Project
The Hooper Project Entity owns the 50 MW Hooper Project located on an approximately 320 acre site owned by the Hooper Project Entity in Alamosa County, Colorado. The Hooper Project achieved commercial operation in December 2015. We indirectly control 100% of the class B membership interests in Hooper Holdings, the indirect owner of 100% of the limited liability company membership interests of the Hooper Project Entity. The class A membership interests in Hooper Holdings are held by an affiliate of Wells Fargo & Company, who is a tax motivated project equity investor, and the class C membership interests in Hooper Holdings are held by SunPower Capital, an affiliate of SunPower. Distributions of cash flows from the Hooper Project are subject to a waterfall. Until the date (the “Hooper Flip Point”), which is the later of the date that the class A member’s effective after-tax internal rate of return equals 7.0% per annum and December 29, 2020, the class A member, the class B member and the class C member are entitled to approximately 15.78%, 84.14% and 0.08%, respectively, of any distributions in excess of a monthly preferred distribution payable to the tax equity investor. The preferred distribution is currently estimated to be approximately $2.0 million per year. After the Hooper Flip Point, the preferred distribution will terminate and the class A member, the class B member and the class C member will be entitled to approximately 5.48%, 94.425% and 0.095%, respectively, of all distributions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of the operating agreement of Hooper Holdings provide that, in the event that the class A member has not achieved an effective after-tax internal rate of return of at least 7.0% per annum as of the date that is eight years after the closing of the transaction contemplated by the purchase and sale agreement, the priority distribution plus 25% of net cash flow in excess thereof shall be distributed to the class A member until the class A member achieves such after-tax internal rate of return.
SunPower Capital is the managing member of Hooper Holdings through their class C membership interests. The class A member and the class B member are not involved in the day-to-day management of Hooper Holdings or the Hooper Project; however, the managing member of Hooper Holdings is required to obtain the other members’ consent for certain customary major decisions concerning the Hooper Holdings and the Hooper Project as set forth in the Hooper Holdings operating agreement. Such major decisions subject to the approval of the class A member and/or the class B member include, for example, incurring indebtedness other than permitted indebtedness, encumbering project assets other than permitted encumbrances, selling project assets other than permitted sales, terminating material project documents under certain conditions, certain changes in method of accounting, merging and consolidating the projects and other such major actions. The class B member has the right to remove the managing member for convenience, and, with the approval of the class A member, install a new managing member.
18

Kingbird Project
The Kingbird Project Entities own the 40 MW Kingbird Project located on two adjoining sites in Kern County, California. The Kingbird Project achieved commercial operation in April 2016. OpCo indirectly owns 100% of the class B membership interests in Kingbird Holdings, the direct owner of 100% of the limited liability company membership interests of the Kingbird Project Entities. The class A membership interests in Kingbird Holdings are held by an affiliate of State Street Bank, who is a tax motivated project equity investor. Distributions of cash flows from the Kingbird Project are subject to a waterfall. Until the date (the “Kingbird Flip Point”), which is the later of the date that the class A member’s effective after-tax internal rate of return equals 6.5% per annum and April 30, 2021, the class A member and the class B member are entitled to 30% and 70%, respectively, of any distributions. After the Kingbird Flip Point, the class A member and the class B member will be entitled to 6.42% and 93.58%, respectively, of all distributions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of the operating agreement of Kingbird Holdings provide that, in the event that the class A member has not achieved an effective after-tax internal rate of return of at least 6.5% per annum as of the date that is ten years after the closing of the transaction contemplated by the purchase and sale agreement, 40% of cash flow shall be distributed to the class A member until the earlier of the class A member achieving such after-tax internal rate of return or the eleventh anniversary. If the class A member did not achieve an effective after-tax internal rate of return of at least 6.5% per annum by the eleventh anniversary, 50% of cash flow shall be distributed to the class A member until the earlier of the class A member achieving such after-tax internal rate of return or the twelfth anniversary. If the class A member did not achieve an effective after-tax internal rate of return of at least 6.5% per annum by the twelfth anniversary, 100% of cash flows shall be distributed to the class A member until the class A member achieves such after-tax internal rate of return.
We are the managing member of Kingbird Holdings through our class B membership interest. The class A member is not involved in the day-to-day management of Kingbird Holdings or the Kingbird Project; however, the managing member of Kingbird Holdings is required to obtain the class A member’s consent for certain customary major decisions concerning Kingbird Holdings and the Kingbird Project as set forth in the Kingbird Holdings operating agreement. Such major decisions subject to the approval of the class A member include, for example, incurring indebtedness other than permitted indebtedness, encumbering project assets other than permitted encumbrances, selling project assets other than permitted sales, terminating material project documents under certain conditions, certain changes in method of accounting, merging and consolidating the projects and other such major actions.
The Kingbird Project is situated on an approximately 324-acre site and consists of a leasehold interest governed by two lease agreements that runs for an initial term of 30 years from February 2, 2015, with an option to extend the lease term for up to two additional ten-year renewal periods at the discretion of the Kingbird Project Entities.
Lost Hills Blackwell
The Lost Hills Project Entity and the Blackwell Project Entity own the 20 MW Lost Hills Project and the 12 MW Blackwell Project, respectively, which are located on adjoining sites in Kern County, California.

C&I Projects
Typical Project Agreements
Our C&I Project Entities have entered into agreements that are customary for C&I solar energy projects. These include agreements for energy sales, construction, equipment supply, O&M services, asset management services and real estate rights. Our C&I Project Entities have also secured necessary and customary construction and operating permits.
Power Purchase Agreements.    Our C&I Project Entities have entered into offtake agreements under which each C&I Project Entity generally receives a fixed price over the term of the offtake agreement with respect to 100% of its output (except as otherwise set forth in the project descriptions below). Such offtake agreements are designed to provide a stable and predictable revenue stream.
Under our C&I Project Entities’ offtake agreements, each party typically has the right to terminate upon written notice ranging from ten to 30 days following the occurrence of an event of default that has not been cured within the applicable cure period, if any. In addition, following an uncured event of default under an offtake agreement by the applicable offtake counterparty, the applicable C&I Project Entities may in most cases, receive termination payments from the applicable offtake counterparty or pursue other remedies available at law or in equity. Events of default under these offtake agreements typically include:

• | failure to pay amounts due;


• | bankruptcy proceedings;


• | failure to provide certain credit support; and


• | breach of material obligations.

Certain of our C&I Project Entities’ offtake agreements have availability or production requirements, and if such requirements are not met, the offtake counterparty has the right to terminate the offtake agreement. Additionally, the obligations (other than payment obligations) of each party under our offtake agreements may be excused by force majeure events, and in some cases, the agreement may be terminated if the force majeure events continue for a continuous period of 12 months.
Interconnection Agreements.    Our C&I Project Entities’ projects interconnect with the applicable offtake customer’s facilities. In certain cases, the counterparties under our offtake agreements or their affiliates have entered into interconnection agreements with large regional utility companies or local distribution companies allowing our applicable project to operate in parallel with their distribution system.
Construction and Equipment Supply Agreements.    Our C&I Project Entities have entered into EPC agreements with a SunPower affiliate. In addition to setting forth the terms and conditions of construction or equipment delivery, as applicable, our C&I Project Entities receive a 25-year power and product warranty on the modules and a two- to ten-year warranty on the system.
O&M and Asset Management Agreements.    Our C&I Project Entities and certain other subsidiaries have entered into O&M agreements and AMAs with SunPower affiliates. Under the terms of the O&M agreements and AMAs, such affiliates agreed to provide a variety of operation, maintenance and asset management services and certain performance warranties to our C&I Project Entities in exchange for a fixed annual fee, subject to certain adjustments. For a detailed description of the terms of the O&M agreements and AMAs applicable to our projects, please read Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence.”
Real Estate Rights.    Our C&I Project Entities and certain other subsidiaries have secured real property interests and access rights that allow our C&I solar energy projects in our Portfolio to operate without material real estate claims until the expiration of the initial terms of applicable offtake agreements, which in some cases are extendable in connection with an extension of the applicable offtake agreements.

Residential Portfolio
Overview.    Our Residential Portfolio is comprised of residential solar power systems with an aggregate of 38 MW of capacity and an average solar power system capacity of approximately 7.95 kW. Our Residential Portfolio is comprised of approximately 5,800 solar installations located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont. We own 100% of the membership interest in the Residential Portfolio Project Entity that owns these residential solar systems. These residential solar power systems are leased to our customers under long-term lease agreements.
Lease Agreements.    A typical lease term is for 20 years and homeowners are obligated to make lease payments to us on a monthly basis. The customer’s monthly payment is fixed based on a calculation that takes into account expected solar energy generation, and certain of our current customer contracts contain price escalators with an average increase of 1% annually. The lease includes a performance warranty under which we agree to make a payment to the customer if the leased system does not meet the guaranteed performance level. Over the term of the lease, we operate and maintain the system. Customers are eligible to purchase their leased solar systems to facilitate the sale or transfer of their homes. The leases also include an early buy-out option, at no less than fair market value, exercisable in the seventh year that allows customers to purchase the solar system.
Operations & Maintenance.    SunPower Systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of SunPower, maintains the Residential Portfolio, including performing system monitoring and preventative and corrective maintenance. The O&M term is concurrent with each customer lease in the Residential Portfolio.

First Solar develops, finances, engineers, constructs and operates solar power generation assets, with over 17.0 GW sold worldwide. First Solar’s integrated power plant solutions deliver an economically 
25

attractive alternative to fossil-fuel electricity generation. From raw material sourcing through end-of-life module recycling, First Solar renewable energy systems protect and enhance the environment.
SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR) is a leading global energy company that delivers complete solar solutions and services to customers worldwide. SunPower designs, manufactures and delivers the highest efficiency, highest reliability solar panels and systems available today. Residential, business, government and utility customers rely on the company’s 30 years of experience. Headquartered in San Jose, California, SunPower has offices in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America. SunPower is majority owned by Total S.A., the fourth largest publicly-listed energy company in the world.
Seasonality
The amount of electricity our solar power systems produce is dependent in part on the amount of sunlight, or irradiation, where the assets are located. Because shorter daylight hours in winter months results in less irradiation, the generation of particular assets will vary depending on the season.
Our power generation is expected to be at its lowest during the winter season of each year. Similarly, our first quarter revenue generation is expected to be lower than other quarters. We reserve a portion of our cash available for distribution and maintain a revolving credit facility in order to, among other things, facilitate the payment of distributions to our Class A shareholders. As a result, we do not expect seasonality to have a material effect on the amount of our quarterly distributions.
Competition
We operate in a capital-intensive industry that is currently highly fragmented and diverse, with numerous industry participants. We compete on the basis of contract price and terms, as well as the location of our projects. There is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, scale and scope of the companies with which we compete. We have numerous competitors with a varied mix of characteristics including our Sponsors and cash generating vehicles similar to us that seek to acquire energy projects from our Sponsors or third parties, as well as other renewable and conventional power generation companies. In addition, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by energy legislation and regulation considered from time to time by federal, state and local legislatures and administrative agencies. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of acquiring, constructing and operating solar energy projects, and some of our competitors may be better able to adapt to and operate under such laws and regulations.
Environmental Matters
We are required to comply with various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These existing and future laws and regulations may impact existing and new solar energy projects, require us to obtain and maintain permits and approvals, comply with all environmental laws and regulations applicable within each jurisdiction and implement environmental, health and safety programs and procedures to monitor and control risks associated with the construction, operation and decommissioning of regulated or permitted solar power systems, all of which involve a significant investment of time and resources.
We also incur costs in the ordinary course of business to comply with these laws, regulations and permit requirements. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations frequently change, and often become more stringent or subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement. Such changes in environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could require us to incur materially higher costs, or cause a costly interruption of operations due to delays in obtaining new or amended permits.
The failure of our operations to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permit requirements may result in administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory, cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations and issuance of injunctions to limit, suspend or cease operations.
In addition, claims by third parties for damages to persons or property, or for injunctive relief, have been brought in the past, and may be brought in the future as a result of alleged environmental, and health and safety impacts associated with our activities.
To operate our projects, we are required to obtain from federal, state and local governmental authorities a range of environmental permits and other approvals, including those described below. In addition to being subject to these regulatory requirements, we have experienced significant opposition from private third parties during the permit application process or in subsequent permit appeal proceedings.

Clean Water Act.    Our projects may be covered under federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) regulations to prevent or contain expected discharges of pollutants or dredged and fill materials into state waters as well as waters of the United States, including adjacent wetlands. On June 29, 2015, the EPA published a final rule that made changes to the EPA’s definition of “waters of the United States.” Various states have filed lawsuits challenging the rule and, in October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an order that temporarily stays implementation of the rule nationwide pending the outcome of the various legal challenges. On February 28, 2017, a presidential Executive Order was issued directing the EPA to review and rescind or revise the rule. On June 27, 2017, EPA proposed a rulemaking that would implement this directive by rescinding the 2015 rulemaking and re-codifying the definition in place prior to 2015. In November 2017, EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed the addition of an applicability date to the 2015 Clean Water Rule that would be two years after the date of a final rule. This change, if adopted, would effectively prevent the rule from coming back into effect immediately if the stay is lifted. Depending on the result of the proposed rulemaking and litigation which will likely result, the CWA permits required by our operations may not be issued, may not be issued in a timely fashion, or may be issued with new requirements which could impose additional obligations on our operations.
BLM Right-of-Way Grants.    Some of our projects are located, or partially located, and projects that we acquire in the future may be located, on lands administered by the BLM. Therefore, we may be required to obtain and maintain BLM right-of-way grants for access to, or operations on, such lands. Obtaining and maintaining a grant requires that the project conduct environmental reviews (discussed below) and implement a plan of development and demonstrate compliance with the plan to protect the environment, including potentially expensive measures to protect biological, archeological and cultural resources encountered on the grant.
Environmental Reviews.    Solar energy projects may be subject to federal, state, or local environmental reviews, where a broad array of the solar energy project’s potential environmental impacts is assessed. Compliance with the environmental review process can be time-consuming and expensive, and generally requires public comment periods, which may open a proposed project up to adverse comments, protests or appeals. Furthermore, an agency may decide to deny a permit based on such an environmental review, or an agency may require environmental mitigation measures to offset any identified impacts. Although we do not expect any delays because of such environmental reviews, they may extend the time and/or increase the costs for obtaining necessary governmental approvals.
Endangered and Protected Species.    Federal agencies considering the permit applications for our projects are required to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “USFWS”) to consider the impact on potentially affected endangered and threatened species and their habitats under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”). Our projects are also required to comply with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (the “MBTA”) and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (the “BGEPA”). Because the operation of solar energy projects could result in harm to endangered species or their habitats, or could result in injury or fatalities to protected birds, federal and state agencies may require ongoing monitoring, mitigation activities, or financial compensation as a condition to issuing a permit for a project. Violations of the ESA, MBTA, BGEPA and similar state laws may result in fines, penalties, criminal sanctions or injunctions, including the possibility of curtailment or shutdown.
Historic Preservation.    State and federal agencies may, under the National Historic Preservation Act or similar law, require our projects to protect historic, archaeological, or religious or cultural resources located or discovered near or on our project sites. Ongoing monitoring, mitigation activities, or financial compensation may be required as a condition of conducting project operations.
Clean Air Act/Climate Change.    In the past few years, the EPA has taken various actions to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. For example, on August 3, 2015, the EPA finalized its Clean Power Plan (“CPP”), which establishes standards to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power generation facilities by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. The current administration has indicated its intention to reverse some of these requirements. For instance, in October 2017, the EPA proposed a rulemaking that would withdraw the CPP. However, on December 18, 2017, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (“ANPRM”) announcing it is considering new emission guidelines to replace the CPP and is soliciting information on how such limitations should be implemented. If, in implementing the CPP or any new or revised regulatory program aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector, federal, state or local governments repealed or altered the incentives currently provided for renewable energy generation, it could adversely affect the attractiveness of renewable energy investments and therefore adversely impact, perhaps materially, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; however, to the extent that renewable energy is competing with higher greenhouse gas emitting energy sources, renewable energy would become more desirable.
Hazardous Waste.    We own and lease real property and may be subject to requirements regarding the management, disposal and remediation of prior contamination associated with the release of petroleum products and/or toxic or hazardous 
27

substances. These regulations include the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and analogous state laws. If our owned or leased properties are contaminated, whether during or prior to our ownership or operation, we could be responsible for the costs of investigation and cleanup and for any related liabilities, including claims for damage to property, persons or natural resources. That responsibility may arise even if we were not at fault and did not cause or were not aware of the contamination. In addition, waste we generate is at times sent to third party disposal facilities. If those facilities become contaminated, we and any other persons who arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at those sites may be jointly and severally responsible for the costs of investigation and remediation, as well as for any claims for damage to third parties, their property or natural resources. We may incur significant costs in the future if we become responsible for the investigation or remediation of hazardous substances at our owned or leased properties or at third party disposal facilities.
Local Regulations.    Our operations are subject to local environmental and land use requirements, including county and municipal land use, zoning, building, water use and transportation requirements. Permitting at the local municipal or county level often consists of obtaining a special use or conditional use permit under a land use ordinance or code, or, in some cases, rezoning in connection with the solar energy project. Obtaining or maintaining a permit often requires us to demonstrate that the solar energy project will conform to development standards specified under the ordinance so that the solar energy project is compatible with existing land uses and protects natural and human environments. Local or state regulatory agencies may require modeling, testing, and, where applicable, ongoing mitigation of radar and other microwave interference in connection with the permitting and approval process. Local or state agencies also may require decommissioning plans and the establishment of financial assurance mechanisms for carrying out the decommissioning plan.
Safety and Maintenance
We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
We perform preventive and normal maintenance on all of our projects and make repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate. We also conduct routine and required inspections of those projects in accordance with applicable regulation.
Regulatory Matters
As owners of contracted solar energy projects and participants in wholesale energy markets, our Project Entities are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These include the FERC and public utility commissions in states where our generating projects are located. In addition, some of our Project Entities are subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various regional transmission organization and independent system operator markets in which they participate.
Federal Power Act
Section 205 of the FPA requires public utilities to obtain FERC’s approval of their rates for the wholesale sale of energy. Some of our Project Entities are public utilities, and each such entity has been granted authority by FERC to sell electricity at market-based rates, rather than on a traditional cost-of-service basis.
The FPA also gives FERC jurisdiction to review certain other activities of our Project Entities. In particular:

• | Section 203 of the FPA requires FERC’s prior approval for any direct or indirect change of control over a public utility or its jurisdictional assets, unless otherwise granted authorization by FERC. In January 2016, FERC issued a declaratory order disclaiming jurisdiction under FPA Section 203 with respect to sales and purchases of our shares and determining that our shares are passive, non-voting securities that will not allow any shareholders to exercise control over our public utility subsidiaries.


• | Section 204 of the FPA gives FERC jurisdiction over a public utility’s issuance of securities or its assumption of liabilities, subject to certain exceptions. However, FERC typically grants blanket approval for security issuances

28

and the assumption of liabilities to public utilities having market-based rate authority. All of our Project Entities that are public utilities have received such blanket approval.

• | In accordance with Section 215 of the FPA, FERC has approved the NERC as the national Electric Reliability Organization (“ERO”) for North America. As the ERO, NERC is responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards for the wholesale electric power system directly and through regional reliability organizations. Each of our Project Entities is required under the FPA to comply with NERC requirements and the requirements of the regional reliability entity for the region in which it is located.

Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005
The PUHCA 2005 provides FERC with certain authority over and access to books and records of public utility holding companies and their subsidiaries that are not otherwise exempt from such requirements. We are a public utility holding company, but because all of our Utility Project Entities are either “Exempt Wholesale Generators” or “Qualifying Facilities,” as defined for purposes of PUHCA 2005, we are exempt from all of the FERC accounting, record retention and reporting requirements of the PUHCA 2005. We and our Project Entities are subject to state utility commission access to books and records under PUHCA 2005 in certain limited circumstances.
Government Incentives
U.S. federal, state and local governments have supported incentives to enhance industry growth and development of cost-competitive, self-sustaining renewable energy generation. These include tax incentives, regulatory programs and net metering policies. Federal tax incentives have historically been financed through tax equity transactions in which owners of renewable energy facilities utilize tax credits through partnerships with third-party investors.
Federal income tax incentives for equipment which uses solar energy to generate electricity include:

• | The Investment Tax Credit: ITC is a tax credit equal to a percentage of the basis of the eligible solar equipment at the commencement of construction (but subject to being placed into service by January 1, 2024) for tax purposes: 30% for eligible solar facilities that commence construction prior to January 1, 2020; 26% for eligible solar facilities that commence construction during 2020; 22% for eligible solar facilities that commence construction during 2021; and 10% for solar facilities that commence construction in 2022 or thereafter. 


• | Modified Accelerated Cost-Recovery System Depreciation: Under MACRS depreciation, owners of the eligible solar equipment claim all of their depreciation deductions for tax purposes with respect to the equipment over five years, even though the useful economic life of such equipment is greater than five years. 


• | Bonus Depreciation: Under the “Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015,” which was signed into law December 18, 2015, owners of eligible solar equipment can claim bonus depreciation for qualified property acquired and placed in service during 2015 through 2019. The bonus depreciation percentage is 50% of the tax depreciable basis for property placed in service during 2015 through September 27, 2017. Under the H.R. 1 (Pub. L. No. 115-97), informally known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “2017 Tax Act”), which was signed into law December 22, 2017, the bonus depreciation percentage is increased to 100% for qualified property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017 and before January 1, 2023, and phases down to 80% in 2023, 60% in 2024, 40% in 2025, 20% in 2026, and 0% for 2027 and thereafter. 

Key state and local programs and incentives include:

• | State Renewable Portfolio Standards: RPS programs are state regulatory programs created by state legislatures to support growth in renewable energy by mandating that electric power providers produce or purchase certain levels of power from renewable sources. 29 states and the District of Columbia currently have an RPS program in place and eight other states have non-binding goals supporting renewable energy. Most states with mandatory RPS programs typically set a target between 10% and 30% of total energy capacity by a specific date, while other states set a MW target to achieve their RPS goals. RPS programs are expected to continue serving as drivers of U.S. renewable energy growth. 


• | Net Metering: Net metering is a policy adopted by various states and utilities that provides customers who own grid-connected DG Solar assets with the ability to pay the utility only for electricity net of electricity generated by the customer’s solar system. Typically, customers receive a credit for any excess production on their regular utility bills. 

29


• | Solar Renewable Energy Certificates: SRECs supplement RPS programs by allowing electric power providers to purchase levels of renewable energy generation that can be used to fulfill state mandates relating to renewable energy. SRECs are purchased and traded separately from the underlying electricity generation in states that have authorized them.
