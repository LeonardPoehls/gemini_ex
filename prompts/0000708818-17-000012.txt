ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Quality Systems, Inc., known to our clients as NextGen Healthcare, provides software, services and analytics solutions to the ambulatory care market. We are a healthcare information technology and services company that delivers the foundational capabilities to organizations that want to promote healthy communities. Our technology provides a customizable platform that empowers physician practice success, enriches the patient care experience and lowers the cost of healthcare.
We primarily derive revenue by developing and marketing software and services that automate certain aspects of practice management (“PM”) and electronic health records (“EHR”) for ambulatory care practices. In addition, our software and services facilitate interoperability. Our software can be licensed and delivered on-premise or in the cloud as software-as-a-service (“SaaS”). Our services include maintenance and support, professional services, and complementary services such as managed cloud services, revenue cycle management (“RCM”) and electronic data interchange (“EDI”). We market and sell our solutions through a dedicated sales force and to a much lesser extent, through resellers. Our clients span the entire ambulatory market from large multi-specialty to small single specialty practices and include networks of practices such as physician hospital organizations (“PHOs”), management service organizations (“MSOs”), accountable care organizations (“ACOs”), ambulatory care centers and community health centers.
We have a history of enhancing our solutions through both organic and inorganic activities. Over the last few years, we have entered into strategic transactions to complement and enhance our product portfolio in the ambulatory care market. In October 2015, we divested our former Hospital Solutions division. In January 2016, we acquired HealthFusion Holdings, Inc. ("HealthFusion") and in April 2017, we acquired Entrada, Inc. ("Entrada").
Quality Systems, Inc. was incorporated in California in 1974. Our principal offices are located at 18111 Von Karman Ave., Suite 800, Irvine, California, 92612. Our websites are located at www.nextgen.com and www.qsii.com. We operate on a fiscal year ending on March 31.
Our Strategy 
We strive to be the trusted partner for clients of all sizes, integrating services and software into a consolidated solution that enables an efficient and effective caregiver and patient experience while driving positive financial outcomes. As a healthcare information technology and services company, we plan to continue investing in our current capabilities as well as building and/or acquiring new capabilities as we guide our clients through an evolving healthcare marketplace that is transitioning from fee-for-service to fee-for-value reimbursement models. With approximately 90,000 providers using our solutions, we are enabling care and believe we can truly transform the delivery of care through the following strategic priorities:

• | Focus on the ambulatory client segment. In October 2015, we sold our former Hospital Solutions division to focus on our core ambulatory clients. Further, a recent operational reorganization better allows us to serve the needs of our ambulatory clients through a simpler, more nimble, and focused organization. We believe it is essential to protect, build

3

and sell new capabilities within our ambulatory client segment. We are focused on our core by increasing quality and the serviceability of our solutions. We intend to continue to enhance the capabilities of our NextGen Ambulatory flagship product. At the same time, we intend to expand the capability of the highly scalable, pure cloud-based and mobile-enabled MediTouch® platform.

• | Platform as a service. With the introduction of our API 2.0 framework and our continued leverage of the Mirth interoperability platform, we will continue our evolution to plug and play extensibility and information sharing that allows our customers to innovate and deploy high-fidelity extensions to our core applications without the costs, risks (security, performance, etc.) or complexity commonly associated with direct binding. We have also introduced platform-enabled automation capabilities to empower our clients to drive cost out of their processes while supporting their needs to implement the highly personalized workflows that are required to support value based care. Our acquisition of Entrada and its cloud-based, mobile application in April 2017 demonstrates our commitment to innovation that becomes essential for practitioners by improving their clinical productivity with documentation support services that seamlessly integrate into their electronic health record. We believe there is significant opportunity to extend the solutions we offer existing and new clients through value-added services such as RCM and EDI. 


• | Population health software and services. We are migrating into applications, analytics and services that will enable our clients to proactively manage the health of patient populations. We are establishing strong development partnerships with our most innovative customers who are actively participating in shared-risk contracts, and working together with them to create progressive population health capabilities. We support extraordinary information sharing capabilities vital to managing patient populations through Mirth interoperability offerings.

Business Organization
We continue to evaluate the organizational structure of our company with the objective of achieving greater synergies and further integration of our products and services, in support of our business strategies. In fiscal year 2016, we initiated a three-phase plan intended to better position our organization for future success. In the first phase, we redesigned the organization to more effectively support the execution of our strategy. This phase included implementing a series of actions with the objective of enabling a more efficient, integrated and client-centered delivery of the holistic solutions that we believe is required by our ambulatory care clients. During this phase, we transformed our management team with the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Strategy Officer. Under phase two of our reorganization, we have continued to build our infrastructure and enhance our healthcare information technology capabilities to drive future revenue growth. The phase includes a multi-year initiative, called NextGen 2.0, to merge our business units into a more streamlined, functional-based organization structure and to realign our organizational structure by consolidating the sales, marketing, information services, and software development responsibilities into single, company-wide roles to achieve greater efficiency. The third phase of the plan will consist of developing and marketing the services and solutions that we believe will accelerate revenue growth. The first phase was completed in April 2016, when we announced a corporate restructuring plan, which was approved by our Board of Directors.
As a result of our ongoing reorganization efforts, we also refined the measurement of our segment data to better reflect our current internal organizational structure. Our reportable segments changed effective July 1, 2016 and may change again due to such changes in the organization of our business. Our operating segments consist of the Software and Related Solutions segment and the RCM and Related Services segment, which is consistent with the disaggregated financial information used and evaluated by our chief operating decision maker (consisting of our Chief Executive Officer) to assess performance and make decisions about the allocation of resources. Revenue and gross profit are the key measures of segment profitability used by our chief operating decision maker to measure segment operating performance and to make key business decisions. The revenues and gross profit of each segment are derived from distinct product and services within each segment. The Software and Related Solutions segment aggregates the revenues and gross profit of our software-related products and services, including software license and hardware, software-related subscription services, support and maintenance, EDI and data services, and certain professional services, such as implementation, training, and consulting. The RCM and Related Services segment aggregates the revenues and gross profit of our RCM services and certain related ancillary service offerings. A growing number of our clients are simultaneously utilizing software or services from more than one of our divisions. To enhance our ability to cross sell products and services, we are further integrating our products and services to provide a more robust and comprehensive platform.

Industry Background and Market Opportunity
We believe there are significant opportunities and challenges in the ambulatory healthcare market due to changes in regulations and requirements that have occurred over the past several years. We have seen Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ("HITECH Act") drive the adoption of EHRs, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010 (“ACA”) drive fundamental changes to the health insurance industry, and most recently, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) is driving value-based payment reform. We believe MACRA may be the most important of the three regulations for our market because it permanently changes how ambulatory healthcare providers are reimbursed by Medicare. It offers certainty and a timeline for the market’s move away from volume-based, fee-for-service models to value-based payment models that reward the delivery of lower cost, high quality care. Because of the scope and complexity of the changes in the 962-page proposed rule, we are focused on educating our clients and the market about these changes and ensuring that we are providing the solutions needed to thrive under the new payment systems established by MACRA.
HCIT solutions have become the catalyst for propelling healthcare into this outcomes-based era and many of our clients are paving the way. As part of the healthcare transformation that is taking place, providers will be held accountable for proactively managing the health of entire patient populations and delivering higher quality care at lower costs. As such, healthcare organizations are likely to invest in healthcare technology and technology-enabled services that will help identify patient risk, engage patients, coordinate care, and determine when intervention is needed to improve clinical and financial outcomes. We are well positioned to provide the solutions providers need to reach these goals. Additionally, we believe there will be an increasing demand for revenue cycle management services that are aligned and integrated with clinical technology solutions. This is another positive development for us since our RCM and Related Services segment provides revenue cycle solutions that are integrated with, and optimize, our technologies for better results. Through our Mirth products, we provide our clients with the ability to securely share data, or interoperability, is also essential to transform the healthcare delivery system into one that provides better care, smarter spending, and healthier people.
Today, our company and our clients are leaders in driving healthcare transformation. As healthcare continues to change, our focus is to help our clients adapt, thrive, and deliver the best patient care possible.

To further improve and simplify our client’s Client Service and Support experience, we recently implemented an Online Client Success Community that allows clients to access support, knowledge articles and documentation, and interact with peers one-on-one, all in one portal.
Proprietary Rights
We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and services. To protect our proprietary rights, we enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees with whom such controls are relevant. In addition, we include intellectual property protective provisions in our client contracts. However, because the software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, we believe such factors as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition, and reliable product maintenance are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position than the various legal protections of our technology.
We rely on software that we license from third parties for certain components of our products and services. These components enhance our products and services and help meet evolving client needs. The failure to license any necessary technology, or to maintain our existing licenses, could result in reduced functionality of or reduced demand for our products.
Although we believe our products and services, and other proprietary rights, do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the future. Any such claims may result in costly, time-consuming litigation and may require us to enter into royalty or cross-license arrangements.
Competition
The markets for healthcare information systems and services are intensely competitive. The industry is highly fragmented and includes numerous competitors. Our principal existing competitors in the healthcare information systems and services market include: Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., athenahealth, Inc., Cerner Corporation, eClinicalWorks, Epic Systems Corporation, GE Healthcare, Greenway Health, LLC, Practice Fusion, and other competitors.
The practice management, EHR, interoperability and connectivity markets, in particular, are subject to rapid changes in technology, and we expect that competition in these market segments could increase as new competitors enter the market. We believe our principal competitive advantages are the features and capabilities of our products and services, our high level of client support, and our extensive experience in the industry.
The RCM market is also intensely competitive as other healthcare information systems companies, such as athenahealth, Inc., GE Healthcare, McKesson Corporation, and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., are also in the market of selling both PM and EHR software and medical billing, collection and claims services.
Research and Development
The healthcare information management and computer software and hardware industries are characterized by rapid technological change requiring us to engage in continuing investments to update, enhance and improve our systems. During the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we expended approximately $86.6 million $80.3 million, and $83.8 million, respectively, on research and development activities, including capitalized software costs of $8.2 million, $14.7 million, and $14.6 million, respectively. The majority of such expenditures are currently targeted on our software license and software related subscription services products lines. In addition, a portion of our product enhancements have resulted from software development work performed under contracts with our clients.
Sales and Marketing
We sell and market our products primarily through a direct sales force and to a lesser extent, through a reseller channel. Software license sales to resellers represented less than 10% of total revenue for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
Our direct sales force typically makes presentations to potential clients by demonstrating the system and our capabilities on the prospective client’s premises. Sales efforts aimed at smaller practices can be performed on the prospective clients’ premises, or remotely via telephone or Internet-based presentations. Both the direct and reseller channel sales force are concentrating on more multi-product sales opportunities. 
7

Our sales and marketing employees identify prospective clients through a variety of means, including referrals from existing clients, industry consultants, contacts at professional society meetings, trade shows and web-based seminars, trade journal advertising, online advertising, public relations and social media campaigns, direct mail and email campaigns, and telemarketing. Resources have shifted more heavily to Web-based marketing to take advantage of buyers that now tend to do more Web research before contacting a vendor and other benefits of online marketing. In addition, we also focus on thought leadership and content marketing to highlight our industry knowledge, expertise and the successes of our client base.
Our sales cycle can vary significantly and typically ranges from six to twenty-four months from initial contact to contract execution. Software licenses are normally delivered to a client almost immediately upon receipt of an order. Implementation and training services are normally rendered based on a mutually agreed upon timetable. As part of the fees paid by our clients, we normally receive up-front licensing fees. Clients have the option to purchase hosting and maintenance services which, if purchased, are invoiced on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis.
We continue to concentrate our direct sales and marketing efforts on the ambulatory market from large multi specialty to small single specialty practices and include clinically integrated networks of practices such as physician hospital organizations (“PHOs”), management service organizations (“MSOs”), accountable care organizations (“ACOs”), ambulatory care centers and community health centers. IPAs, PHOs and similar networks to which we have sold systems provide use of our software to those group and single physician practices associated with the organization or hospital on either a service basis or by directing us to contract with those practices for the sale of stand-alone systems.
We have numerous clients and do not believe that the loss of any single client would adversely affect us. No client accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue during the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Substantially all of our clients are located in the United States.
Employees
As of March 31, 2017, we employed approximately 2,791 individuals, of which 2,771 were full-time employees, and 472 employees were located in Bangalore, India. Aside from our Bangalore facility, which focuses primarily on software development activities, substantially all of our employees and operations are based in the United States.
We believe that our future success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining qualified sales, marketing and technical personnel as well as other employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union.
