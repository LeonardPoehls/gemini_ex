ITEM 1. BUSINESS     General
     We are a commercial real estate company that invests primarily in new or recently-constructed and opened self-storage facilities located predominately in dense urban submarkets within large United States metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”). Facilities in which we invest are largely vertical (three to ten floors), 100% climate controlled and technologically adapted buildings, which we call Generation V facilities, located in submarkets with demographic profiles and competitive positions that management believes will support successful lease-up and value creation in the project. Our investments include mortgage loans typically coupled with equity interests as well as outright ownership of self-storage facilities.
 ﻿
 Our principal business objective is to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns by investing in new Generation V facilities primarily in urban submarkets. A substantial majority of our investments to date have been first mortgage loans to finance ground-up construction of and conversion of existing buildings into new Generation V self-storage facilities. These investments, which we refer to as “development property investments,” are structured as loans equal to between 90% and 97% of the cost of the facility. We receive a fixed rate of interest on loaned amounts and up to a 49.9% interest in the positive cash flows from operations, sales and /or refinancings of self-storage facilities, which we refer to as “Profits Interest”. We typically receive a right of first refusal (“ROFR”) to acquire the self-storage facility upon sale.
 ﻿
 We have also selectively made construction loans and mortgage loans secured by mature operating self-storage facilities. In order to adapt our investment activities to the current self-storage cycle, we have recently announced our intention to make bridge mortgage loans to refinance primarily Generation V facilities that have been developed since 2013 and are currently in lease-up. We anticipate that facilities refinanced by our bridge loans will predominately be in locations and have demographic and competitive profiles that are very similar to our development property investments. On March 2, 2018, we closed our first bridge loan investment consisting of five separate bridge loans with an aggregate commitment amount of $83.3 million secured by first mortgages on five properties in the Miami, Florida MSA. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments.”
 ﻿
 In addition to the foregoing, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired the 50.1% equity interests of our developer partner in our Orlando 1 and Orlando 2 development property investments, which are two self-storage facilities adjacent to each other. Moreover, in January and February 2018, we acquired the 50.1% equity interests of our developer partners in our Jacksonville 1, Atlanta 1, Atlanta 2 and Pittsburgh development property investments. Each property is now wholly-owned by us, and the Orlando 1 and Orlando 2 properties are now fully consolidated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 ﻿
 We account for our development property investments and operating property loans at fair value, with appreciation and depreciation in the value of these investments being reflected in the carrying value of the assets and in the determination of net income. We intend to account for bridge loans with Profits Interest in the same way. In determining fair value, we re-value each development property investment and operating property loan each quarter, which re-valuation includes an analysis of the current value of any Profits Interest associated with the investment. We believe that carrying our assets at fair value and reflecting appreciation and depreciation in our earnings provide our stockholders and others who rely on our financial statements with a more complete and accurate understanding of our financial condition and economic performance, including our revenues and the intrinsic value inherent in our Profits Interests as self-storage facilities we finance are constructed, leased-up and become stabilized.
 ﻿
 We have funded all of our on-balance sheet investments to date with the following sources of capital:
 ﻿

﻿ |  | net proceeds from our initial public offering (“IPO”) and concurrent private placement, which were consummated on April 1, 2015;
--+---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

﻿ |  | proceeds from the sale of senior participations, which we also refer to as “A notes”, in certain investments;
--+---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

﻿ |  | net proceeds from the issuance of our Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) between us and funds managed by Highland Capital Management, L.P. providing for the issuance and sale of up to $125.0 million of Series A Preferred Stock from time to time until July 28, 2018;
--+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

﻿ |  | net proceeds from our follow-on public offerings of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share (“common stock”) which were consummated on December 13, 2016 and June 27, 2017;

 On March 7, 2016, we, through our Operating Company, entered into the Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “JV Agreement”) of Storage Lenders LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, to form a real estate venture (the “SL1 Venture”) with HVP III Storage Lenders Investor, LLC (“HVP III”), an investment vehicle managed by Heitman Capital Management LLC (“Heitman”). The SL1 Venture was formed for the purpose of providing capital to developers of self-storage facilities identified and underwritten by us. Upon formation, HVP III committed $110.0 million for a 90% interest in the SL1 Venture, and we committed $12.2 million for a 10% interest. On March 31, 2016, we contributed to the SL1 Venture three self-storage development investments with an aggregate commitment amount of $41.9 million. As of December 31, 2017, the SL1 Venture had closed on eight additional development property investments with a Profits Interest with an aggregate commitment amount of approximately $81.4 million, bringing the total aggregate commitment of SL1 Venture’s investments to $123.3 million as of December 31, 2017.
 ﻿
 We are externally managed and advised by JCAP Advisors, LLC. The Manager is led by our founder and chief executive officer, Dean Jernigan, and our president and chief operating officer, John A. Good. Mr. Jernigan is a 30-year veteran of the self-storage industry, including a combined 16 years as the chief executive officer of Storage USA and CubeSmart, both New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listed self-storage REITs. During his time at these two companies, Mr. Jernigan oversaw the investment of over $3 billion of capital in the self-storage industry. Mr. Good has over 29 years of experience working with senior management teams and boards of directors of public companies in the REIT and financial services industries on corporate finance, corporate governance, merger and acquisition, tax, executive compensation, joint venture, and strategic planning projects as a nationally recognized corporate and securities lawyer. Prior to joining the Company, he served as lead counsel on over 200 securities offerings, including our IPO, raising in excess of $25 billion over the past 25 years, with more than 125 of those deals being in the REIT industry. We believe the industry experience and depth of relationships of our senior management team and other investment professionals provide us with a significant competitive advantage in sourcing, evaluating, underwriting and servicing self-storage investments.
 ﻿
 We are a Maryland corporation that was organized on October 1, 2014 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains, to the extent that we annually distribute all of our REIT taxable income to stockholders and comply with certain other requirements for qualification as a REIT set forth in the Code. We are structured as an UPREIT and conduct our investment activities through our Operating Company. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“the 1940 Act”).
 ﻿
 Investment Strategy 
 ﻿
 We target investments in self-storage facilities primarily in the top 50 United States MSAs as delineated by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. We believe attractive development investment and bridge loan opportunities currently exist due to:
 ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | consistently strong long-term self-storage industry fundamentals;
﻿ | | 

  ﻿

﻿ |  | a current robust cycle for development of new self-storage facilities;
--+---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

﻿ |  | significant new supply of Generation V self-storage facilities sponsored by entrepreneurial developers who desire to refinance such facilities prior to stabilization;
--+---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ | | 

  ﻿

﻿ |  | significant demand for loans secured by self-storage facilities; and
--+---+---------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ | | r 

  ﻿

﻿ |  | reluctance of commercial banks and other capital providers to finance new self-storage development projects.
--+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 We seek to directly originate and structure our target investments utilizing the contacts and self-storage knowledge and experience of our Manager’s personnel, which enables us to: (1) originate broad and adaptable investments that meet the specific needs of our customers and meet our requirements for qualification as a REIT and exclusion from the definition of an investment company under the 1940 Act; (2) have direct access to our borrowers and enhance our underwriting, structuring and due diligence processes; (3) provide meaningful insight to our customers’ pro forma capital structures, construction budgets, projections and operational decisions; and (4) earn origination fees. We believe that direct origination of investments also provides us the opportunity to service such loans on an ongoing basis, allowing us to utilize our substantial self-storage industry expertise to better monitor and reduce the risk of loss of principal on our investments.
 ﻿
 We possess a ROFR to purchase the underlying self-storage facility in a majority of our development property investments. Our ROFR is typically triggered when the owner of a self-storage facility obtains a firm offer for the purchase of the facility from a third party that such 

 
6


owner desires to accept. After receipt of notice of such offer, we typically have 10 to 15 business days to exercise our right to purchase the project at the price and on the terms set forth in the bona fide third party offer. Following our exercise of our ROFR, we typically have a 20 to 30 business day inspection period, and we may cancel our exercise of our ROFR prior to the end of such inspection period. After expiration of the inspection period, we will close the purchase of the self-storage facility. Our out-of-pocket funds to close the purchase of a facility acquired by our exercise of our ROFR will typically be the contract purchase price less mortgage debt and less any Profits Interest we have with respect to the facility. In a situation where we continue to hold the debt on the facility, our out-of-pocket funds to close would typically be approximately equal to the owner’s equity and share of profit on the sale of the facility. We expect to exercise rights of first refusal to purchase self-storage facilities we have financed, subject to our ability to obtain financing. 
 ﻿
 In addition, from time-to-time, we purchase developers’ interests in the development properties in which we have co-invested. We do not typically initiate these transactions; rather, they are usually initiated by a developer prior to the time such developer can list a project for sale to a third party, triggering our ROFR. A developer is free to offer for sale to us (but not others) the developer’s interest in a project, and we are free to accept, reject and/or negotiate any such offer. To date, developers of five projects have sold their interests to us in this manner. 
     The majority of investments we originate are in principal amounts ranging from $5 million to $15 million.
      Target Investments
     We focus primarily on originating the following types of investments: 
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | Development Property Investments: These investments are intended to finance ground-up construction of self-storage facilities or major self-storage conversion or redevelopment opportunities generally in the top 50 MSAs. These investments are typically funded over a 12 to 24 month period as the developer completes the project. After an initial advance at closing under our development loan, typically between a nominal amount and 5% to 10% of our committed principal, funding of construction draws typically commences 90 to 120 days following the loan closing, subject to the timing of building permits, which sometimes can be delayed up to 180 days or more following closing. Our development investments typically have been structured as first mortgages on the development projects, with a term of 72 months, are interest-only with a fixed interest rate of 6.9% per annum, and provide us with a 49.9% Profits Interest in the borrowing entity consisting of an interest in the positive cash flows (including sale and refinancing proceeds after debt repayment) of the project. We generally provide 90% of the cost to develop and construct new development projects, with cost being inclusive of land acquisition, design and other soft costs, hard costs, a developer’s fee and operating and interest reserves designed to fund the project until it is earning enough cash flow to cover all costs, including interest on our investment.

﻿ |  | Bridge Loans: These loans are intended to refinance existing Generation V facilities that are in lease-up. Proceeds from our bridge loans are for the purpose of repaying existing construction loans, returning equity to capital partners and/or funding operating losses and interest payments during lease-up. We anticipate that bridge loans will (i) be secured by a first mortgage on the financed asset(s); (ii) have terms of 5 to 7 years; (iii) bear interest at fixed rates, with the rate depending on any given bridge loan being determined based on the stage of lease-up of the financed self-storage facility; (iv) contain an equity participation, with the amount dependent on the stage of lease-up of the financed self-storage facility; and (v) be coupled with a ROFR to acquire the financed self-storage facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had not made any bridge loans. On March 2, 2018, we closed our first bridge loan investment consisting of five separate bridge loans with an aggregate commitment amount of $83.3 million secured by first mortgages on five properties in the Miami, Florida MSA. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments.”

﻿ |  | Wholly-Owned Property Investments: In connection with our development property investments and bridge loans, we have typically received ROFRs to acquire the self-storage facilities underlying our investments. Subject to acquisition prices being consistent with our investment objective to create long-term value for our stockholders, we intend to acquire a significant number of the self-storage facilities that we have financed either through the exercise of ROFRs or through privately negotiated transactions with our investment counterparty. Under our development property investment documents, the developer is generally prohibited from selling the self-storage facility until the later of three years following the initial closing of our investment or two years following the facility opening for business. In 2017, our developer partner in our Orlando 1 and Orlando 2 investments offered to sell us his remaining membership interests in the limited liability companies (“LLCs”) that owned the projects such that we would own 100% of the equity interests in such LLCs, and we consummated that purchase in August 2017. In addition, our developer partners in our Jacksonville 1, Atlanta 1, Atlanta 2 and Pittsburgh investments offered to sell us their remaining membership interests in the LLCs that owned those projects, and we consummated those purchases in the first quarter 2018. Our wholly-owned properties are, and we expect that for the foreseeable future they will be, managed by third-party professional managers. See “—Operations Strategy—Property Management and Operations.”

 ﻿
 In addition to our primary focus, we occasionally and selectively will originate land loans and credit lines to facilitate a development property investment. These loans are intended for borrowers who are typically seeking short-term capital to be used in an acquisition, refinancing, recapitalization or repositioning of a given facility, portfolio or partnership interest or pursuit of development sites. These loans typically have maturities of three years or less. We will provide land loans only if secured by a first mortgage on a self-storage site that has proper zoning and an acceptable environmental condition and only to borrowers who intend to refinance such land loans with development investments made by us. We expect these loans to be an insignificant part of our business. These loans are accounted for at historical cost and are not subject to fair value adjustments.

 Investment Activity
     On-balance sheet investment activity
     Our self-storage investments at December 31, 2017 consisted of the following:
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | Development Property Investments - We had 44 investments totaling an aggregate committed principal amount of approximately $500.1 million to finance the ground-up construction of, or conversion of existing buildings into, self-storage facilities. Each development property investment is funded as the developer constructs the project and is typically comprised of a first mortgage and a 49.9% Profits Interest. The loans are secured by first priority mortgages or deeds of trust on the projects and, in certain cases, first priority security interests in the membership interests of the owners of the projects. Loans comprising development property investments are non-recourse with customary carve-outs and subject to completion guaranties, are interest-only with a fixed interest rate of typically 6.9% per annum and typically have a term of 72 months.

﻿ | Included in development property investments as of December 31, 2017 was one construction loan with a committed principal amount of approximately $17.7 million and an initial term of 18 months that was extended during the first quarters of 2017 and 2018. This construction loan is interest-only at a fixed interest rate of 6.9% per annum, has no equity participation and is secured by a first priority mortgage on the project. The self-storage facility under construction is subject to a purchase and sale agreement between the developer and a third-party purchaser pursuant to which the financed project is anticipated to be sold and the loan repaid on or about the time a certificate of occupancy is issued for the financed self-storage facility, which is expected in the second quarter of 2018.
﻿ | 

  ﻿
 As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate committed principal amount of our development property investments was approximately $517.8 million and outstanding principal was $207.1 million, as described in more detail in the table below (dollars in thousands):

(4) | These investments contain a higher LTC ratio and a higher interest rate, some of which interest is payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest. The PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each debt agreement, is periodically added to the principal balance of the debt and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment.
(5) | During the first quarter of 2018, we purchased our partner’s 50.1% Profits Interest in these investments. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments” for information regarding these purchases.

 Real estate venture activity
 ﻿
 On March 7, 2016, we, through our Operating Company, entered into the JV Agreement of Storage Lenders LLC to form SL1 Venture with HVP III, an investment vehicle managed by Heitman. The SL1 Venture was formed for the purpose of providing capital to developers of self-storage facilities identified and underwritten by us. Upon formation, HVP III committed $110.0 million for a 90% interest in the SL1 Venture, and we committed $12.2 million for a 10% interest. On March 31, 2016, we contributed to the SL1 Venture three self-storage development investments in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Florida that were not yet under construction. These investments had an aggregate committed principal amount of approximately $41.9 million and aggregate drawn balances of $8.1 million (fair value of $7.7 million). In addition, as of December 31, 2017, the SL1 Venture had closed on eight new development property investments with a Profits Interest with an aggregate commitment amount of approximately $81.4 million, bringing the total aggregate commitment of SL1 Venture’s investments to $123.3 million as of December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, HVP III and the Company agreed to true up the balances in the respective members’ capital accounts to be in accordance with the 90% commitment and 10% commitment made by HVP III and the Company, respectively. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2016, HVP III contributed cash of $7.3 million to the SL1 Venture, and the Company received a $7.3 million cash distribution as a return of its capital.
 ﻿
 Under the JV Agreement, we receive a priority distribution (after debt service and any reserve but before any other distributions) out of operating cash flow and residual distributions based upon 1% of the committed principal amount of loans made by the SL1 Venture, exclusive of the loans contributed to the SL1 Venture by us. Operating cash flow of the SL1 Venture (after debt service, reserves and the foregoing priority distributions) will be distributed in accordance with capital commitments. Residual cash flow from capital and other events (after debt service, reserves and priority distributions) will be distributed (i) pro rata in accordance with capital commitments (its “Percentage Interest”) until each member has received a return of all capital contributed; (ii) pro rata in accordance with each member’s Percentage Interest until Heitman has achieved a 14% internal rate of return; (iii) to Heitman in an amount equal to its Percentage Interest less 10% and to us in an amount equal to our Percentage Interest plus 10% until Heitman has achieved a 17% internal rate of return; (iv) to Heitman in an amount equal to its Percentage Interest less 20% and to us in an amount equal to our Percentage Interest plus 20% until Heitman has achieved a 20% internal rate of return; and (v) any excess to Heitman in an amount equal to its Percentage Interest less 30% and to us in an amount equal to our Percentage Interest plus 30%. However, we will not be entitled to any such promoted interest prior to the earlier to occur of the third anniversary of the JV Agreement and Heitman receiving distributions to the extent necessary to provide Heitman with a 1.48 multiple on its contributed capital.
 ﻿
 Under the JV Agreement, during the pendency of the SL1 Venture, and as long as the SL1 Venture holds any assets, Heitman has the right of first offer to participate in any joint venture or similar program pursued by us on substantially the same terms as those set forth in the JV

Agreement. This right of first offer includes any investment of debt or equity or otherwise, directly or indirectly, in one or more new joint ventures or similar programs for the purposes of funding or providing development loans or financing, directly or indirectly, for the development, construction or conversion of self-storage facilities.
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2017, SL1 Venture had 11 development property investments with a Profits Interest as described in more detail in the table below (dollars in thousands):

 Operations Strategy
 ﻿
 We believe our relationship with our Manager and our ability to capitalize on its self-storage industry reputation, relationships, market knowledge and expertise provide us with substantial benefits in sourcing, underwriting and evaluating attractive investments, executing such investments quickly and effectively, and managing our assets. Under our Management Agreement, our Manager is responsible for administering our business activities and day-to-day operations, including sourcing and originating investment opportunities, providing underwriting services, processing approvals for all loans, acquisitions and other investments in our portfolio and negotiating the terms of any purchase of an investment counterparty’s interest in a self-storage facility. The Manager has an Investment Committee, currently consisting of Messrs. Jernigan and Good, that reviews all loans and other investments to determine whether they meet our investment guidelines and are otherwise appropriate for our portfolio. The following is a description of the key elements of our Manager’s business operations:
 ﻿
 Origination
 ﻿
 Our Manager utilizes its self-storage industry knowledge and relationships to originate a substantial majority of our investments. Six of the 17 employees of our Manager who provide services to the Company, including Messrs. Good and Jernigan, are actively engaged in the origination process. The Manager’s employees leverage contacts with self-storage facility owners, developers, national commercial real estate brokers, commercial mortgage loan brokers, financial institutions and other persons with an active presence in the self-storage industry in the United States seeking investment opportunities. Each employee of the Manager responsible for originating loans has the self-storage industry knowledge, real estate and finance expertise to determine what investment structure best meets the needs of the borrower and the optimal structure of a financing solution. We believe the self-storage industry experience, knowledge and relationships of our Manager uniquely position us to significantly grow our investment portfolio.
 ﻿


 
11


Underwriting
 ﻿
 Each of our Manager’s employees who originate investment opportunities evaluates such opportunities in accordance with specific underwriting guidelines, policies and procedures in order to determine suitability for both the borrower and our portfolio. Our Manager performs underwriting due diligence on all proposed transactions prior to loan approval and commitment.
 ﻿
 In general, our Manager’s underwriting guidelines require it to evaluate the following, as appropriate:
 ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | the character and integrity of the developer/owner of the project;
﻿ | | 

  ﻿

﻿ |  | the proposed ownership structure, the financial strength, real estate and self-storage industry experience of the borrower’s principals, background check on principals, third party appraisal, insurance review, and environmental and engineering studies;
--+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ | | 

  ﻿

﻿ |  | appropriate sub-market demographics, including population density, average household incomes, percentage of non-subsidized renters, per capita self-storage square footage, competitors and rental rates;
--+---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ | | 

  ﻿

﻿ |  | with respect to development projects, the construction budget, required interest reserves, the guaranteed maximum price construction contract, buy-out of subcontractors, zoning and entitlement issues for construction and major redevelopment loans;
--+---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ | | 

  ﻿

﻿ |  | with respect to existing projects, the construction quality of the self-storage facility to determine future maintenance and capital expenditure requirements, stage of lease up, quality of management, rental market conditions and prevailing market cap rates;
--+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ | | 

  ﻿

﻿ |  | historical, current and projected rental rates, occupancy levels, revenues and expenses in the sub-market, and for existing facilities, as to that facility;
--+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ | | 

  ﻿

﻿ |  | the historical, current and projected rental rates, occupancy levels and expense levels at comparable facilities;
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ | | 

  ﻿

﻿ |  | the potential for near term revenue growth and opportunity for expense reduction and increased operating efficiencies; the facility’s location, its attributes and competitive position within its market, existing competition as well as future competition;
--+---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ | | 

  ﻿

﻿ |  | the review of a mortgagee’s title status and survey;
--+---+-----------------------------------------------------
﻿ | | 

  ﻿

﻿ |  | the requirements for any reserves, including those for immediate repairs or rehabilitation, replacement reserves, real estate taxes and facility casualty and liability insurance;
--+---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ | | 

  ﻿

﻿ |  | the availability of capital for refinancing by the borrower if the loan does not fully amortize; and
--+---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ | | 

  ﻿

﻿ |  | the internal rate of return.
--+---+-----------------------------

  ﻿
 Key factors considered in credit decisions include debt service coverage, LTV and LTC ratios, development yield, debt yield, cash equity remaining in the deal or level of cash out to the borrower, competitive set relative performance, and facility historical and projected operating performance. Key factors considered in decisions to acquire 100% of the interests in a self-storage facility include stage of lease-up, historical cash flows and current run rate cash flows relative to run rate interest income on our development property investment, leasing experience of the facility and the projected stabilized cap rate on our total investment cost. Consideration is also given to other factors such as borrower concentration, facility concentration (both by type and location), identification of repayment strategy and expected changes in market conditions.
     Investment Approval Process
     Our Manager applies its approval process to all proposed loans and acquisitions prior to submitting proposals to our Manager’s Investment Committee for final approval. A proposed loan or investment is analyzed and a written investment memorandum and financial summary is prepared. The memorandum includes a description of the prospective borrower and sponsor, demographic and competitive information, a description of the site and the proposed collateral and the proposed use of investment proceeds, and an analysis of favorable investment factors and key risk factors. In addition, the presentation provides information summarizing uses of proceeds, net operating income projections, development and debt yields, competitive data and coverage ratios. Where the investment involves an operating property (for example, bridge loans or outright purchases), the memorandum contains information regarding physical condition and operations. Each transaction is presented for approval to our Manager’s Investment Committee, which consists of Messrs. Jernigan and Good. All transactions require the approval of both members of our Manager’s Investment Committee. In addition, the approval of our Board of Directors is required if more than 20% of our equity, determined as of the date of such investment, will be invested in any single project.
    

 
12


Following the approval and closing of any transaction, our Manager’s servicing and portfolio management group provide customary loan monitoring and servicing to assure that loan approval terms have been satisfied and that they conform to the lending requirements for that particular transaction.
 ﻿
 Loan Processing and Servicing
     We service all of our development property investments, bridge loans and other loans with an internal staff employed by our Manager. Our internal staff is assisted in serving development property investments, including processing construction draw requests, by a nationally known construction consultant. The responsibilities of our loan processing and servicing team include:
﻿ | | 
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | assisting in investment due diligence, documentation and closing;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+----------------------------------------
﻿ |  | analyzing and processing draw requests;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | ensuring that development projects remain free from impermissible liens and encumbrances;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+----------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | collecting and analyzing project and developer financial information;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+--------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | determining compliance with loan covenants;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | collecting interest, fees and principal amounts owed on loans; and

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | assisting our accounting and finance team in determining the fair value of our investments and ensuring proper accounting.

  ﻿
 Our processing and servicing team utilizes the services of nationally-known independent consultants to inspect projects that are in the construction process and provide guidance with respect to the processing of construction draws.
     Property Management and Operations
 ﻿
 Our developer partners manage the ownership entity for each project they develop; however, we require each self-storage facility that is the subject of a development property investment or bridge loan to be managed operationally by a professional self-storage manager, which we define as a manager who (i) has a presence on the first page of Google in the facility’s market, (ii) runs a professional and adequately staffed call center, and (iii) maintains a state-of-the-art revenue management function staffed by experienced professionals and utilizes the most current technology. We also utilize professional managers for all wholly-owned self-storage facilities. We believe the benefits to us of professional third-party management include:
 ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | national branding of our facilities providing enhanced marketing and top tier internet presence;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+----------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | significant economies of scale that reduce operating and G&A expense;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+---------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | sophisticated revenue management that optimizes profitability;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | access to state-of-the-art accounting and information systems that enhance reporting; and

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | continuous exposure to latest management trends and thoughtful leadership in the self-storage sector that benefits our relationships with our customers.

  ﻿
 As of December 31, 2017, the developers of 53 out of our 56 development property investments (including those made by our SL1 Venture) have selected CubeSmart as the third-party manager. Two developers selected Life Storage and one developer, who is a National Storage Affiliate participating regional operator, manages its own facility.
 ﻿
 Once a self-storage facility opens for business, we monitor operational data. We are granted full access to the third-party manager’s property accounting system with respect to the self-storage facilities such manager manages for us. Our internal investment management team, consisting of our President and Chief Operating Officer, Vice President of Investment Management, one of our Directors of Business Development and our Property Compliance Analyst, regularly reviews operating and financial information about our facilities, including summary rental experience reports, facility leasing dashboards, monthly profit and loss reports and other relevant information. In addition, we have a consulting relationship with a former chief operating officer of a large self-storage REIT pursuant to which he from time to time assists our team in reviewing property operations and makes suggestions for improvements. We share pertinent information with our developers to assist them with solid management practices. We believe that active oversight of property operations is essential to protecting our invested capital, collaborating with our developer partners to optimize profitability, holding our third-party managers accountable for performance and ensuring timely management decisions that maximize the value of our investments.

﻿
 Investment Guidelines
     Our Board of Directors has adopted the following general guidelines for our investments and borrowings:
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | no investment will be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | no investment will be made that would cause us to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | no more than 20% of our equity, determined as of the date of such investment, will be invested in any single project and no more than 20% of our equity, determined as of the date of such investment, will be invested in projects controlled by a single borrower or group of affiliated borrowers that would form a consolidated group under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”);

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | over time our average leverage will be in the 25% to 35% range, but we may borrow up to 100% of the principal value of certain development loans secured by first mortgages;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | we will maintain a portfolio of geographically diverse assets; and

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | our Manager must seek the approval of a majority of our independent directors before engaging in any transaction that falls outside of our investment guidelines.

  ﻿
 These investment guidelines may be changed or waived by our Board of Directors (which must include a majority of our independent directors) without the approval of our stockholders.
     Relationship with Our Manager
     On April 1, 2015, we entered into a management agreement with our Manager (as amended, the “Management Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement, our Manager is responsible for (a) our day-to-day operations, (b) determining investment criteria and strategy in conjunction with our Board of Directors, (c) sourcing, analyzing, originating, underwriting, structuring, and acquiring our portfolio investments, and (d) performing portfolio management duties. The Manager has an Investment Committee that approves investments in accordance with our investment guidelines, investment strategy, and financing strategy.
     On May 23, 2016, we entered into an Amended and Restated Management Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Management Agreement”) by and among the Company and the Manager that amends and restates the original Management Agreement dated April 1, 2015. The Amended and Restated Management Agreement was approved on behalf of the Company and the Operating Company by a unanimous vote of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors, which consists solely of independent directors.
     The Amended and Restated Management Agreement modifies certain procedures with respect to the future internalization of the Manager (as described in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, an “Internalization Transaction”). Prior to entry into the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, if no Internalization Transaction had occurred prior to the end of the last renewal term, the Manager would have been entitled to the Termination Fee (as defined in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement) and we would not have acquired the assets of the Manager. The Amended and Restated Management Agreement, however, requires an Internalization Transaction at the end of the last renewal term (if an Internalization Transaction or termination of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement has not occurred prior to that date). The Internalization Price in such event would equal the Termination Fee amount and we would receive the Manager’s assets. Accordingly, the amount the Manager would receive has not changed, but we now would receive the assets of the Manager, which it would not have received prior to the Amended and Restated Management Agreement. 
     Under the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, if an Internalization Transaction has not occurred prior to March 31, 2023, the last day of the last renewal term, then the Manager and the Company shall consummate an Internalization Transaction to be effective as of that date and all assets of the Manager (or, alternatively, all of the equity interests in the Manager) shall be conveyed to and acquired by the Operating Company in exchange for the Internalization Price (as described herein). At such time, all employees of the Manager shall become employees of the Operating Company and the Manager shall discontinue all business activities. Unlike an Internalization Transaction that occurs prior to the end of the final renewal term of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, an Internalization Transaction that occurs at the end of the final renewal term shall not require a fairness opinion, the approval of a special committee of the our Board of Directors or the approval of the our stockholders.
     The “Internalization Price” payable in the event of an Internalization Transaction at the end of the last renewal term shall be equal to the Termination Fee and our Board of Directors has no discretion to change such Internalization Price or the conditions applicable to its payment.
     The Internalization Price paid to the Manager in any Internalization Transaction will be payable by the Operating Company in the number of units of limited liability company interests (“OC Units”) of the Operating Company equal to the Internalization Price, divided by the volume-weighted average of the Company’s closing market price of the common stock for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date with respect to which value must be determined. However, if our common stock is not traded on a national securities exchange at the time 

 
14


of closing of any Internalization Transaction, then the number of OC Units shall be determined by agreement between our Board of Directors and the Manager or, in the absence of such agreement, the Internalization Price shall be paid in cash.
     Prior to entry into the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, any Termination Fee would have been payable by the Operating Company in OC Units equal to the Termination Fee divided by the average of the daily market price of our common stock for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of termination within 90 days after occurrence of the event requiring the payment of the Termination Fee. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 505-50, Equity - Equity-based Payments to Non-Employees, since the number of OC Units to be issued was dependent upon different possible outcomes, we recognized the lowest aggregate amount within the range of outcomes. Accordingly, we estimated the deferred termination fee payable and accrued the expense over the term of the Management Agreement. Upon entry into the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, we ceased recognizing the deferred termination fee expense and reclassified the Non-Controlling Interests to Additional Paid-In-Capital since the Termination Fee is no longer certain of being paid other than in exchange for either the assets or equity of the Manager. Accordingly, we recorded no expense, $0.2 million and $0.5 million of expense for the deferred termination fee for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 ﻿
 On April 1, 2017, we, the Operating Company and the Manager entered into a Second Amended and Restated Management Agreement to modify the manner in which certain expenses incurred by the Manager are accounted for and paid by us. Under the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, the Manager may engage independent contractors that provide investment banking, securities brokerage, mortgage brokerage and other financial, legal and account services as may be required for our investments, and we agree to reimburse the Manager for costs and expenses incurred in connection with these services. The Second Amended and Restated Management Agreement now provides that expenses incurred by the Manager are reimbursable to the Manager by us only to the extent such expenses are not otherwise directly reimbursed by an unaffiliated third party. The amount of expenses to be reimbursed to the Manager by us will be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of any such payment or reimbursement.
 ﻿
 On November 1, 2017, we, the Operating Company and the Manager entered into the Third Amended and Restated Management Agreement in order to clarify the original intent of the parties with respect to the definition of Core Earnings and to make other minor changes necessary to reflect the current and anticipated business model from and after this time. The Third Amended and Restated Management Agreement is otherwise substantially consistent with the Second Amended and Restated Management Agreement.

 Under the Third Amended and Restated Management Agreement, “Core Earnings” is defined as (1) net income (loss) determined under GAAP, plus (2) non-cash equity compensation expense, the incentive fee, depreciation and amortization, plus (3) any unrealized losses or other non-cash expense items reflected in GAAP net income (loss), less (4) any unrealized gains reflected in GAAP net income (including any unrealized appreciation with respect to self-storage facilities that we have not yet acquired). The Third Amended and Restated Management Agreement clarifies that in addition to certain previously agreed upon adjustments, with respect to any self-storage facility acquired by us with respect to which we had an outstanding loan as of the time of such acquisition, the amount of Core Earnings determined pursuant to the formula above in the period of such acquisition shall also be increased by the difference between (A) the appraised value, as determined by a nationally recognized, independent third-party appraiser mutually agreed to by us and the Manager who has significant expertise in valuing self-storage properties, and (B) (i) the outstanding principal amount of any one of our loans secured by such acquired self-storage facility at the time of such acquisition plus (ii) any other consideration given to the former owner upon such acquisition. This addition is intended to include in Core Earnings the amount of our unrealized gain on account of our acquisition of a self-storage facility without such facility being sold to a third party buyer in the open market.
     The initial term of the Management Agreement will expire on March 31, 2020, with up to a maximum of three, one-year extensions that end on March 31, 2023. Our independent directors will review the Manager’s performance annually. Following the initial term, the Management Agreement may be terminated annually upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors based upon: (a) the Manager’s unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to the Company; or (b) we determine that the management fees payable to the Manager are not fair, subject to the Manager’s right to prevent termination based on unfair fees by accepting a reduction of management fees agreed to by at least two-thirds of the independent directors. We are required to provide our Manager with 180 days’ prior notice of such a termination. Upon such a termination, we will pay the Manager a Termination Fee except as provided below.
 ﻿
 No later than 180 days prior to the end of the initial term of the Management Agreement, the Manager will offer to contribute to our Operating Company at the end of the initial term all of the assets or equity interests in the Manager at the internalization price and on such terms and conditions included in a written offer provided by the Manager.
     Upon receipt of the Manager’s initial internalization offer, a special committee consisting solely of our independent directors may accept the Manager’s proposal or submit a counter offer to the Manager. If the Manager and the special committee are unable to agree, the Manager and the special committee will repeat this process annually during the term of any extension of the Management Agreement. Acquisition of the Manager pursuant to this process requires a fairness opinion from a nationally recognized investment banking firm and stockholder approval, in addition to approval by the special committee. As described above, if an Internalization Transaction has not occurred prior to March 31, 2023, the last day of the last renewal term, then the Manager and the Company shall consummate an Internalization Transaction to be effective as of that date, and such Internalization Transaction shall not require a fairness opinion, the approval of a special committee of our Board of Directors or the approval of our stockholders.

If the Management Agreement terminates other than for Cause, voluntary non-renewal by the Manager or the Company being required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, then we shall pay to the Manager, on the date on which such termination is effective, a Termination Fee equal to the greater of (i) three times the sum of the average annual Base Management Fee and Incentive Fee earned by the Manager during the 24-month period prior to such termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to the date of termination, or (ii) the offer price, which will be based on the lesser of (a) the Manager’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted for unusual, extraordinary and non-recurring charges and expenses), or “EBITDA” annualized based on the most recent quarter ended, multiplied by a specific multiple, or EBITDA Multiple, depending on our achieved total annual return, and (b) our equity market capitalization multiplied by a specific percentage, or Capitalization Percentage, depending on our achieved total return (the Internalization Price). Any Termination Fee will be payable by the Operating Company in cash.
     We also may terminate the Amended and Restated Management Agreement at any time, including during the initial term, without the payment of any Termination Fee, with 30 days’ prior written notice from the Board of Directors, for cause. “Cause” is defined as: (i) the Manager’s continued breach of any material provision of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement following a prescribed period; (ii) the occurrence of certain events with respect to the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Manager; (iii) a change of control of the Manager that a majority of our independent directors determines is materially detrimental to us; (iv) the Manager committing fraud against us, misappropriating or embezzling our funds, or acting grossly negligent in the performance of its duties under the Amended and Restated Management Agreement; (v) the dissolution of the Manager; (vi) the Manager fails to provide adequate or appropriate personnel that are reasonably necessary for the Manager to identify investment opportunities for us and to manage and develop our investment portfolio if such default continues uncured for a period of 60 days after written notice thereof, which notice must contain a request that the same be remedied; (vii) the Manager is convicted (including a plea of nolo contendere) of a felony; or (viii) both the current Chief Executive Officer and the current President and Chief Operating Officer are no longer senior executive officers of the Manager or us during the term of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement other than by reason of death or disability.
     The Manager may terminate the Amended and Restated Management Agreement if the Company becomes required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, with such termination deemed to occur immediately before such event, in which case we would not be required to pay the Manager a Termination Fee. The Manager may also decline to renew the Amended and Restated Management Agreement by providing the Company with 180 days’ written notice, in which case we would not be required to pay a Termination Fee.
     The Amended and Restated Management Agreement provides for the Manager to earn a base management fee and an incentive fee. In addition, the Company will reimburse certain expenses of the Manager, excluding the salaries and cash bonuses of the Manager’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, a portion of the salary of the president and chief operating officer, and certain other costs as determined by the Manager in accordance with the Amended and Restated Management Agreement. Certain prepaid expenses and fixed assets are also purchased through the Manager and reimbursed by the Company. In the event that the Company terminates the Amended and Restated Management Agreement per the terms of the agreement, other than for cause or the Company being required to register as an investment company, there will be a Termination Fee due to the Manager. Amounts reimbursable to the Manager for expenses are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and totaled $3.0 million, $3.3 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
     Management Fees
     As of December 31, 2017, the Company did not have any employees. As a result, we are relying on the properties, resources and personnel of the Manager to conduct operations. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, we pay the Manager a base management fee in an amount equal to 0.375% of the Company’s stockholders’ equity (a 1.5% annual rate) calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in cash. For purposes of calculating the base management fee, the Company’s stockholder’s equity means: (a) the sum of (i) the net proceeds from all issuances of the our equity securities since inception (allocated on a pro rata daily basis for such issuances during the fiscal quarter of any such issuance), plus (ii) our retained earnings at the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter (without taking into account any non-cash equity compensation expense incurred in current or prior periods); less (b) any amount that we pay to repurchase our common stock since inception, provided that if our retained earnings are in a net deficit position (following any required adjustments set forth below), then retained earnings shall not be included in stockholders’ equity. It also excludes (x) any unrealized gains and losses and other non-cash items that have impacted stockholders’ equity as reported in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and (y) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP (such as a cumulative change to our operating results as a result of a codification change pursuant to GAAP), and certain non-cash items not otherwise described above (such as depreciation and amortization), in each case after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and approval by a majority of our independent directors. As a result, our stockholders’ equity, for purposes of calculating the base management fee, could be greater or less than the amount of stockholders’ equity shown on our financial statements. The base management fee is payable independent of the performance of our portfolio. The Manager computes the base management fee within 30 days after the end of the fiscal quarter with respect to which such installment is payable and promptly delivers such calculation to our Board of Directors. The amount of the installment shown in the calculation is due and payable no later than the date which is five business days after the date of delivery of such computation to the Board of Directors. The base management fee was $3.5 million, $1.7 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had outstanding fees due to Manager of $1.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, consisting of the management fees payable and certain general and administrative fees payable.

Incentive Fee
     The Manager is entitled to an incentive fee with respect to each fiscal quarter (or part thereof that the Management Agreement is in effect) in arrears in cash. The incentive fee will be an amount, not less than zero, determined pursuant to the following formula:
     IF = .20 times (A minus (B times .08)) minus C
     In the foregoing formula:
     • A equals our Core Earnings (as defined below) for the previous 12-month period;
     • B equals (i) the weighted average of the issue price per share of our common stock of all of its public offerings of common stock, multiplied by (ii) the weighted average number of all shares of common stock outstanding (including (i) any restricted stock units and any restricted shares of common stock in the previous 12-month period and (ii) shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding OC Units); and
     • C equals the sum of any incentive fees earned by the Manager with respect to the first three fiscal quarters of such previous 12-month period.
     Notwithstanding application of the incentive fee formula, no incentive fee shall be paid with respect to any fiscal quarter unless cumulative annual stockholder total return for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters is greater than 8%. Any computed incentive fee earned but not paid because of the foregoing hurdle will accrue until such 8% cumulative annual stockholder total return is achieved. The total return is calculated by adding stock price appreciation (based on the volume-weighted average of the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE (or other applicable trading market) for the last ten consecutive trading days of the applicable computation period minus the volume-weighted average of the closing market price of our common stock for the last ten consecutive trading days of the period immediately preceding the applicable computation period) plus dividends per share paid during such computation period, divided by the volume-weighted average of the closing market price of the our common stock for the last ten consecutive trading days of the period immediately preceding the applicable computation period. For purposes of computing the Incentive Fee, “Core Earnings” is defined as net income (loss) determined under GAAP, plus non-cash equity compensation expense, the incentive fee, depreciation and amortization (to the extent that we foreclose on any facilities underlying our target investments), any unrealized losses or other non-cash expense items reflected in GAAP net income (loss), less any unrealized gains reflected in GAAP net income. The amount will be adjusted to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash charges after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of the independent directors. Going forward, “Core Earnings” will be calculated based on the new formulation set forth in the Third Amended and Restated Management Agreement, which the Company, the Operating Company and the Manager entered into on November 1, 2017.
     The Manager computes each quarterly installment of the incentive fee within 45 days after the end of the fiscal quarter with respect to which such installment is payable and promptly delivers such calculation to our Board of Directors. The amount of the installment shown in the calculation is due and payable no later than the date which is five business days after the date of delivery of such computation to the Board of Directors. The Manager has not earned an incentive fee for any quarter in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
     Competition
     Our net income depends, in part, on our ability to make loans and acquire facilities at favorable spreads over our cost of capital. In originating or acquiring our target investments, we may compete to a limited degree with other self-storage REITs, primarily including four publicly-traded self-storage REITs (Public Storage, Extra-Space Storage, CubeSmart and Life Storage, Inc.), and, with respect to financing transactions, to a greater degree with other commercial mortgage REITs, specialty finance companies, such as business development companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, financial institutions, governmental bodies and other entities. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have considerably greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us, such as the U.S. Government. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT tax compliance or maintenance of an exemption from the 1940 Act. Current market conditions may attract more competitors, which may increase the competition for sources of financing. An increase in the competition for sources of funding could adversely affect the availability and cost of financing, and thereby adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
     In the face of this competition, we have access to our Manager’s professionals and their self-storage industry expertise, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage and helps us assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for certain potential investments. This expertise enables us to compete more effectively for attractive investment opportunities. Moreover, we believe many traditional institutional debt investors do not possess the self-storage industry knowledge or experience to appropriately assess the riskiness of loans secured by self-storage facilities, and, accordingly, such investors may not compete effectively on pricing and terms for self-storage investments our Manager originates. However, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face. For additional information concerning these competitive risks, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors— We operate in a competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to originate or acquire desirable investments in our target investments and could also affect the pricing of these securities”.

 Employees
 ﻿
 We have no employees and are managed by our Manager pursuant to our Management Agreement. Our Manager currently has 17 officers and employees who provide services to the Company. Our executive officers, comprised of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), President and Chief Operating Officer (“COO”), and Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (“CFO”), are owners and/or employees of our Manager.
     Exemption from Regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940
     We conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis (the “40% test”). Excluded from the term “investment securities,” among other things, are U.S. Government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exemption from the definition of investment company for private funds set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act.
     We are organized as a holding company that conducts its businesses primarily through wholly- and/or majority-owned subsidiaries. We conduct our operations so that we and the Operating Company do not hold “investment securities” in excess of the limit imposed by the 40% test. The securities issued by any wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that we have formed or may form in the future that are excepted from the definition of “investment company” based on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a value in excess of 40% of the value of our total assets (as determined under the 1940 Act) on an unconsolidated basis. We will monitor our holdings to ensure continuing and ongoing compliance with this test. In addition, we believe we will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act because we will not engage primarily, propose to engage primarily, or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, through our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries, we are and continue to be primarily engaged in the non-investment company businesses of these subsidiaries.
     If the value of securities issued by our subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of “investment company” by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, together with any other investment securities we own, exceeds 40% of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis, or if one or more of such subsidiaries fail to maintain an exception or exemption from the 1940 Act, we could, among other things, be required either (a) to substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company, (b) to effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time when, we would not otherwise choose to do so, or (c) to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, any of which could have an adverse effect on us and the market price of our securities, negatively affect our operations, the value of our common stock, the sustainability of our business model, and/or our ability to make distributions.
     In 2011, the SEC solicited public comment on a wide range of issues relating to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act, including the nature of the assets that qualify for purposes of the exemption and whether mortgage REITs should be regulated in a manner similar to investment companies. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the 1940 Act status of REITs, including the SEC or its staff providing more specific or different guidance regarding these exemptions, will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations.
     Although we monitor our portfolio periodically and prior to each investment origination or acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this exemption from registration for these subsidiaries.
     In addition, we, our Operating Company and/or our subsidiaries may rely upon other exclusions, including the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(6) of the Investment Company Act (which excludes, among other things, parent entities whose primary business is conducted through majority-owned subsidiaries relying upon the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C), discussed above), from the definition of an investment company and the registration requirements under the Investment Company Act. The SEC staff has issued little interpretive guidance with respect to Section 3(c)(6) and any guidance published by the staff could require us to adjust our strategy accordingly.
     We determine whether an entity is one of our majority-owned subsidiaries. The 1940 Act defines a majority-owned subsidiary of a person as a company 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of which are owned by such person, or by another company which is a majority-owned subsidiary of such person. The 1940 Act further defines voting securities as any security presently entitling the owner or holder thereof to vote for the election of directors of a company. We treat companies in which we own at least a majority of the outstanding voting securities as majority-owned subsidiaries for purposes of the tests described above. We have not requested the SEC to approve our treatment of any company as a majority-owned subsidiary and the SEC has not done so. If the SEC were to disagree with our treatment of one or more companies as majority-owned subsidiaries, we would need to adjust our strategy and our assets in order to continue to pass the 40% test. Any such adjustment in our strategy could have a material adverse effect on us.
    

 
18


To the extent that the SEC staff provides more specific guidance regarding any of the matters bearing upon the exemptions we and our subsidiaries rely on from the 1940 Act, we may be required to adjust our strategy accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could further inhibit our ability to pursue the strategies we have chosen.
