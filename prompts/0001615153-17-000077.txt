ITEM 1. BUSINESS
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to "Fenix" refer to Fenix Parts, Inc. solely, and references to the "Company," "our", "we", "us" and similar terms refer to Fenix Parts, Inc., together with our Subsidiaries, as defined below. 
OVERVIEW
We are in the business of automotive recycling, which is the recovery and resale of original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") parts, components and systems, such as engines, transmissions, radiators, trunks, lamps and seats (referred to as "products") reclaimed from damaged, totaled or low value vehicles. We purchase our vehicles primarily at auto salvage auctions. Upon receipt of vehicles, we inventory and then dismantle the vehicles and sell the recycled products. Our customers include collision repair shops (body shops), mechanical repair shops, auto dealerships and individual retail customers. We also generate a portion of our revenue from the sale as scrap of unusable parts and materials, from the sale of used cars and motorcycles, the sale of aftermarket parts, and from the sale of extended warranty contracts.
We provide customers with high quality recycled OEM products, extensive inventory and product availability, responsive customer service and fast delivery. We operate a hub and spoke distribution network allowing us to efficiently move products among our locations and expedite delivery to our customers. We distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops, including recycled OEM products, as well as aftermarket, refurbished and remanufactured parts. Collectively, we refer to these products as alternative parts because they are not new OEM products.
History
Fenix was founded on January 2, 2014 to acquire and combine companies in the automobile recycling and resale industry. Fenix Parts Canada, Inc. ("Fenix Canada"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fenix, was established on September 24, 2014 primarily to facilitate the acquisition and combination of companies in the automobile recycling and resale industry in Canada. Through November 2014, Fenix and Fenix Canada entered into Combination Agreements to acquire (in transactions referred to as the "Combinations") eleven corporate entities that operate eight businesses (the "Founding Companies"), contingent upon, among other things, the closing of an initial public offering ("IPO"). On May 19, 2015, Fenix completed the IPO and closed on the Combinations with the Founding Companies, including those Founding Companies that are designated as accounting co-predecessors, Don’s Automotive Mall, Inc., Gary’s U-Pull It, Inc., and Horseheads Automotive Recycling, Inc. (collectively, the "Beagell Group"); and Standard Auto Wreckers Inc., End of Life Vehicles Inc., Goldy Metals Incorporated, and Goldy Metals (Ottawa) Incorporated (collectively, "Standard"). The aggregate consideration paid by Fenix in the Combinations (the "Combination Consideration") is detailed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this document. Fenix raised the cash portion of the Combination Consideration in its IPO as well as from indebtedness. The operations of the Founding Companies are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition on May 19, 2015. During the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2015, Fenix acquired three additional automobile recycling companies ("Subsequent Acquisitions"). Our Founding Companies and Subsequent Acquisitions represent our operating subsidiaries ("Subsidiaries"). The operations of our Subsequent Acquisitions are also reflected in the consolidated statements of operations from their respective dates of acquisition. 
Products
The recycled OEM products that we sell include mechanical parts used to repair or replace worn or damaged components, such as engines and transmissions, and collision repair parts used to repair vehicles typically involved in a collision, such as door assemblies, trunk lids, lights, fenders and other products. These products are "insurance quality," which means they are acceptable for use in a repair paid for by an insurance company. Many consumers and repair facilities use recycled OEM products because they are less expensive than new OEM products and are perceived to be of higher quality and better fit than products made by non-OEM manufacturers, known as aftermarket products. Recycled OEM products often are sold as assemblies, which shorten repair times and help reduce labor costs. In addition, insurance companies are increasingly influencing repair facilities to use recycled OEM products as a lower cost alternative to new OEM products. 
Typically, damaged, totaled or low value vehicles acquired by insurance companies are resold through auto salvage auctions. Some insurance companies mandate that recycled OEM products be no older than the vehicle they are used to repair; thus, the majority of the vehicles we acquire are not more than ten years old. We employ software-based inventory management systems to determine what vehicles to purchase and at what price, based upon our estimation of the demand for the products on the vehicle, the prices we can obtain for those products and the final scrap value of the vehicle. 
The demand for our products and services is influenced by several factors, including the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles being driven, the number and age of drivers, the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents, the age of vehicles in accidents, availability and pricing of new OEM parts and weather conditions. There is no standard price for many of our products, but rather a pricing structure that varies based upon such factors as product availability, quality, demand, new OEM product prices, the age and mileage of the vehicle from which the part was obtained and competitor pricing.

In addition, we generate revenues from the disposal of end of life vehicles, related scrap sales and the sale of extended warranties. We obtain scrap as a byproduct from vehicles that have been used in both full-service and self-service recycling operations. The sale of scrap includes catalytic converters, fluids, wheels and tires, copper wiring, cores and crushed hulls. Ancillary revenues related to the disposal of end of life vehicles and related scrap sales will vary based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold.
Customers
Our customers include collision and mechanical repair shops, auto dealerships and individual retail customers. Competition for sales is based primarily on product availability, delivery times and price. Our ability to deliver insurance quality recycled OEM products on a same or next day basis is a critical service requirement of our customers. Customers can find and purchase our parts in many ways including searching our websites, by telephone (speaking with one of our sales professionals) or in-person at one of our fulfillment centers. We apply a coordinated regional approach to our inventory management and distribution activities, which allows us to increase the availability of our products and efficiently meet demand within the markets we serve. In 2016, we sold products to more than 12,000 customers. There were no significant customers that accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during 2016 or 2015.
Industry
The Auto Care Association ("ACA") estimates that the U.S. automotive aftermarket was approximately $267 billion in 2016. We operate in the U.S. collision and mechanical repair products market, a subset of the U.S. automotive aftermarket. According to ACA, the U.S. collision and mechanical repair products market was approximately $70 billion in 2016.
The automotive recycling industry is highly fragmented, with few multi-facility operators. According to the Automotive Recyclers Association ("ARA"), there are an estimated 9,400 vehicle recycling facilities in the United States and Canada. We believe that there is only one direct competitor with more than 1% market share within the automotive recycling industry. We believe this competitor has less than 10% market share.
The automotive recycling industry obtains its insurance quality recycled OEM products from damaged, totaled or low value vehicles purchased at salvage auctions. In 2016, there were over 300 salvage auction locations in the U.S. and Canada at which over 2.5 million damaged, totaled or low value vehicles were sold on behalf of automobile insurance companies and other sellers to licensed buyers, such as us.
The industry’s direct customers are collision and mechanical repair shops that use recycled OEM products in vehicle repairs. The industry also indirectly serves insurance companies as they pay for the majority of repairs to insured vehicles and thus have significant influence over the repair process. Major U.S. insurance companies are encouraging collision repair shops to reduce costs, thus influencing them to utilize recycled OEM products in the repair of damaged vehicles.
In addition, automotive recycling is considered environmentally responsible, as approximately 86% of a vehicle's material content is typically reclaimed or recycled. We believe that many environmentally conscious consumers prefer recycled products and over time government regulation will continue to favor environmentally friendly solutions.
Competition
Buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources: new products produced by OEM; new products produced by companies other than the OEMs, which are commonly referred to as aftermarket products; recycled OEM products obtained by automobile recyclers from salvage vehicles; used automotive products that have been refurbished; and used automotive products that have been remanufactured. We view all suppliers of vehicle replacement products as our competitors. While we compete with all parts suppliers, there are few automobile recyclers with regional distribution networks like ours that can reach the majority of customers within the optimum delivery time. We have begun to distinguish ourselves from other suppliers primarily through our broad recycled OEM product selection, which encompasses popular and hard-to-find items or products, our distribution network, stock management systems, and our service. We compete on the basis of product breadth and depth, rapid and dependable delivery, marketing initiatives, support services, and price.
COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
Favorable Industry Dynamics
We believe that demand for recycled OEM products is highly stable and marked by consistent long-term growth due to a number of favorable trends, including the number of vehicles on the road (commonly referred to as the "car parc"), the increasing miles driven and the number and age of drivers. Additionally, we believe the utilization of recycled OEM products over the last decade has continued to increase given the inherent favorable pricing and product availability of recycled OEM products relative to other replacement products.
Competitive Market Position
We believe that we operate the second largest network of automotive recycling companies in the eastern region of North America (U.S. and Canada) with twelve full-service and four self-service recycling locations, two of which are co-located at existing full-service facilities, 
7

although our Toronto, Ontario facility (the "Toronto facility") was severely damaged in a fire in April 2017. Please see the section below entitled "Facilities" and Risk Factors for a more detailed discussion of the fire and its repercussions. We believe the strength of our regional network, our customer relationships and our extensive inventory of insurance quality recycled OEM automotive products give us a competitive advantage and create high barriers to entry.
Extensive Inventory and Distribution Platform with Broad Customer Reach
Our extensive inventory of insurance quality recycled OEM automotive products and our distribution infrastructure give us the ability to help our customers reduce repair cycle time by delivering our products typically the same or next day. In order to increase the availability of our products, we maintain an extensive inventory and have developed a coordinated regional approach to inventory management and distribution. Our network enables us to reach three of the ten largest cities in North America by population. This customer base exceeds 12,000 customers with no one customer accounting for more than 3% of our consolidated net revenues in 2016 and 2015.
Dynamic Vehicle Procurement Process
A critical component of our success and growth is our ability to identify and value the products that can be recycled from a salvage vehicle. We have developed a scalable, data-driven approach, utilizing real-time sales and inventory information, which allows us to procure vehicles in a cost-efficient manner, optimize the dismantling process and profitably sell these products to our customers.
Deep Industry Expertise
We benefit from the industry expertise and deep customer relationships that have been established at the Subsidiaries over the course of their history as standalone businesses. Our key management personnel at most of the Subsidiaries have served an average of 20 years in the automotive recycling industry and many have held senior leadership positions in key industry trade groups, such as the ARA.
Experienced Management Team
Our senior management has significant experience operating and growing automotive and logistics-based businesses. Prior to co-founding Fenix, our Chief Executive Officer, Kent Robertson, held several senior leadership positions at Stericycle, Inc. ("Stericycle"), a national reverse logistics and regulated waste management company. Mr. Robertson had more than 20 years of experience managing multi-line decentralized distribution and services businesses at Stericycle and at American Medical Disposal, Inc., a company he co-founded in 1990, which was acquired by Stericycle in 2001. Under Mr. Robertson’s leadership, Stericycle successfully completed and integrated over 70 acquisitions. Our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Pettit, also a co-founder of Fenix, has significant automotive industry, public company, acquisition and integration experience, including serving from 2001 to 2007 as the Chief Financial Officer of Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc. 
Attractive Financial Model
We believe our highly variable cost structure, low requirements for capital expenditures (in 2016, our maintenance capital expenditures were less than 1% of total revenues) and the stability of the collision and mechanical repair products market combine to give our business the potential to deliver strong results through a variety of business cycles. We believe that these factors should allow us to produce significant cash flow. However, our achieving these cash flows has been, and may continue to be constrained by the extraordinary levels of professional fees that we have experienced.
Organizational Structure
We operate on a decentralized basis with an emphasis on regional and local market execution supported by corporate coordination. Local management teams operate the businesses and leverage their relationships with customers and suppliers. At the same time, certain administrative functions are centralized on a regional and, in certain circumstances, a national basis, including but not limited to corporate strategy and acquisitions, accounting and related functions, marketing, human resources, information technology and systems support and environmental compliance. 
STRATEGY
We believe that there is significant demand for a strong “number two” participant in the OEM automotive parts recycling business to compete with the industry leader, and that the execution of our business strategies would allow us to grow and to enhance shareholder value. However, because of our lack of liquidity (described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and lack of strong internal control over financial reporting and integrated information systems, which has led to extraordinarily high professional fees and delays in being able to publicly report financial results, we are currently not in a position to implement or continue to pursue many of these business strategies, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future.
Enhance and Build our Network through Acquisitions
The acquisition of other OEM automotive products recycling businesses is a key element of our strategy. This would increase our customer base, grow our distribution network and expand our inventory and warehouse capacity. There are currently an estimated 9,000 facilities in the automotive recycling industry, and we believe an ample number of attractive acquisition candidates. Subsequent to our initial public offering and the acquisition of the Founding Companies, during 2015 we acquired three businesses operating in geographic areas that fit 
8

within our strategic growth plan. We use a disciplined approach to identify and evaluate acquisition candidates to increase customer and route density within our network and expand into new geographic markets. However, our Credit Facility and related Forbearance Agreement (described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) contain financial covenants that are likely to preclude the acquisition of new businesses for the foreseeable future.
Organically Grow Market Share and Unit Volume
We have identified initiatives to increase vehicle processing throughput, inventory and product availability, and thereby grow revenue, volume and market share. However, because of our current lack of liquidity described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may not be able to fully pursue these initiatives in the foreseeable future.
These initiatives include:

• | Expand Dismantling Capacity. We operate 67 dismantling bays within our full-service auto recycling facilities. We can also add bays or shifts to increase dismantling utilization. We believe these initiatives would help us increase dismantling capacity and productivity, thereby increasing inventory and product availability to meet additional demand for our products.


• | Develop an Integrated Technology Platform. We currently utilize third-party software solutions to support our business. We believe this software is sufficient for our current needs, but we are working to implement an integrated technology platform to support our future growth. We believe that any associated cost would be offset through improvements in salvage vehicle procurement, production management, part pricing, inventory management, marketing, sales, logistics and compliance.


• | Enhance Sales Force Effectiveness. We maintain sales specialists in their local markets to preserve high levels of service and existing customer relationships. We seek to provide our sales force with enhanced training and additional resources to reach new markets and customers.


• | Expand our Logistics Capacity. We intend to continue to expand our logistics capacity to meet the delivery expectations of our customers (typically the same or next day). Provided sufficient capital is available, we may invest in additional infrastructure, including trucks, employees or transfer hubs, to expand in existing markets and into adjacent markets.

Enhance Operating Efficiencies and Increase Profit Margins
We have identified certain best practices among our Subsidiaries that improve salvage vehicle procurement and dismantling, enhance product delivery and maximize the value of end-of-life vehicles. We have begun to implement these best practices across our network to improve our operating efficiencies and profit margins. Further, we believe an integrated operating platform within geographic areas creates opportunities for economies of scale as we grow.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We own various trade names as a result of the acquisitions of the Subsidiaries. We do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single or group of related trade names. 
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 633 employees at our recycled parts facilities and approximately 33 employees at our corporate headquarters. We enjoy good relations with our employees and are not party to any labor management agreement. 
RELATED PARTIES
Please refer to Item 13, "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence," and Note 15 Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our related parties and corresponding transactions with them.
FACILITIES
We lease an office building in Westchester, Illinois, which serves as our corporate headquarters. This facility will meet our growth requirements for the foreseeable future. 
We have twelve full-service recycling facilities, concentrated in the Northeastern and Southeastern United States and Southeastern Canada. These locations include Bayville, NJ, Binghamton, NY, Forest City, NC, Greensboro, NC, Niagara Falls, NY, Pennsburg, PA, Rahway, NJ, Ottawa, Ontario, Port Hope, Ontario, Queensbury, NY, Watertown, NY, and Jacksonville, FL. Our full-service recycling facilities have a total of 67 bays for dismantling of vehicles and approximately 553,000 square feet of indoor warehouse space and approximately 226 acres of total storage. Our facilities employ state-of-the art environmental systems for removing fluids prior to dismantling. We have 
9

four self-service locations, two of which are co-located with full-service facilities. Our self-service locations are in Binghamton, NY, Elmira, NY, Ottawa, Ontario and Scarborough, Ontario. At these locations, we allow retail customers to directly dismantle, recover and purchase recycled OEM products. Our self-service recycling facilities have approximately 77,000 square feet of indoor storage space and are situated on approximately 55 acres. 
On April 6, 2017, a fire destroyed the buildings and contents therein, including computer equipment and certain accounting records, located at our Scarborough (Toronto), Ontario facility. The vehicle inventory stored on the premises was largely undamaged. We maintain insurance for property damage and business interruption losses; however, coverage is subject to deductibles, limits and certain exclusions and may not be sufficient to cover all of the losses incurred. We plan to recommence operations as soon as practicable and rebuild the Toronto facility and infrastructure using insurance proceeds. The Ontario Ministry of Environment and Climate Change issued an order prohibiting us from receiving and processing vehicles at the Toronto facility until the Ministry has accepted a plan to recommence operations in an environmentally safe manner. We are cooperating with all environmental and licensing authorities to recommence operations as soon as practical. See Risk Factors below for further information.
