OVERVIEW
 We are a diversified healthcare company with core businesses consisting of our Crinone® (progesterone gel) (“Crinone”) franchise and our fee-for-service pharmaceutical development and manufacturing business called Juniper Pharma Services (“JPS”). In addition, we are seeking to use our differentiated intravaginal ring (“IVR”) technology to advance a pipeline of product candidates intended to address unmet needs in women’s health, through either internal development or external partnering. We are actively exploring business development collaborations, including opportunities that could leverage our IVR technology and/or the pharmaceutical development capabilities of JPS. 
 In January 2018, we announced that we would be exploring strategic alternatives in order to enhance shareholder value. We engaged Rothschild Global Advisory Group as our independent financial advisor to assist us and our Board of Directors in evaluating potential strategic alternatives. 
 In September 2017, we announced a reduction of approximately 8% of our workforce, primarily in the areas of new product research and development, in order to focus our resources on our core businesses. In addition, as part of our more focused research and development strategy, we completed our in vivo preclinical studies and expect to finalize the results of these studies for our IVR programs, which consist of JNP-0101, JNP-0201 and JNP-0301 (the “IVR program”) in the first half of 2018. At the completion of the in vivo preclinical studies and based on our preliminary assessment of the relative clinical data and development funding requirements of our three IVR product candidates, we plan to seek the support of one or more partners for our IVR product candidates to potentially include our entire IVR platform.
 Our commercial product and product development programs utilize our proprietary drug delivery technologies, which we believe are suited to applications in women’s health. These technologies consist of our bioadhesive delivery system (“BDS”), a polymer designed to adhere to epithelial surfaces or mucosa and achieve sustained and controlled delivery of active drug product, and our novel IVR technology.
 We currently receive product revenues from Crinone, an 8% progesterone bioadhesive vaginal gel designed for progesterone supplementation or replacement as part of an assisted reproductive technology (“ART”) treatment for infertile women with progesterone deficien
cy. We supply Crinone to Merck KGaA (“Merck KGaA”) internationally, and sold the rights to Crinone to Allergan, plc (“Allergan”) in the United States (the “U.S.”). In January 2018, we announced the extension of the supply agreement with Merck KGaA for an additional 4.5-years through at least December 31, 2024.
 Through our subsidiary, JPS, we offer a range of sophisticated technical services to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry on a fee-for-services basis. Within our services offering, we provide our customers expertise on the characterization, development and manufacturing of small molecule compounds. Our services model allows us to take our customers’ drug candidates from early development through to clinical trials manufacturing. We also support our customers with advanced analytical and consulting services for intellectual property issues, and we have particular expertise in problem solving for challenging compounds that are considered “difficult to progress.”
 Our strategy is to support the growth of Crinone in key markets and expand both the JPS technical and geographic reach, while at the same time advancing a pipeline of new product candidates through external partnering. We believe this strategy positions us well for capital-efficient growth. Internally-funded research and development expenditures were $6.9 million, $9.7 million and $7.0 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 Our commercial product and product development programs are described below: 
 
 
• | CRINONE, an 8% progesterone bioadhesive vaginal gel for progesterone supplementation or replacement as part of an ART treatment for infertile women with progesterone deficiency, is approved for marketing in the United States, Europe, and many additional countries around the world. Crinone is the primary source of our commercial revenue. We have licensed Crinone to our commercial partner, Merck KGaA, for all markets outside the United States, and we received product

revenues from the manufacture and sale of Crinone to Merck KGaA internationally. We sold the U.S. intellectual property rights to Crinone to Allergan in 2010, and received royalty revenues from Allergan based on its U.S. sales through October 2016. In November 2016, we entered into an agreement with Allergan to monetize future royalty payments due to us. Under the agreement, we received a one-time non-refundable payment of $11.0 million in exchange for which Allergan will no longer be required to make future royalty payments to us.

• | JNP-0101 is an IVR product candidate designed to deliver oxybutynin for the treatment of overactive bladder (“OAB”) in women. Oxybutynin is currently approved for the treatment of OAB, however, oral oxybutynin therapy is frequently discontinued by patients due to undesirable side effects including dry mouth, blurred vision, and constipation. We expect that the delivery of oxybutynin using our IVR technology will provide an improved side effect profile as the drug will bypass first pass hepatic metabolism issues. In the case of oxybutynin the drug is metabolized in the liver to an active metabolite resulting in increased central nervous system (“CNS”) side effects. In addition, we believe that delivery using our IVR technology will improve patient compliance and convenience versus other routes of administration, including oral therapies, patches, and gels. We completed our preclinical animal studies and expect to finalize the results of these studies for our IVR programs, which consist of JNP-0101, JNP-0201 and JNP-0301 (the “IVR program”) in the first half of 2018. Pending the final results of these studies, we plan to seek a partner for our JNP-0101 product candidate, on a stand-alone basis or in combination with one or more of our other IVR program candidates.

• | JNP-0201 is a segmented IVR product candidate containing both natural progesterone and natural estradiol to be used for HRT in menopausal women. JNP-0201 has been designed to deliver natural hormones locally to vaginal tissue. This is another example where avoiding first pass, hepatic metabolism of estradiol may result in an improved side-effect profile. We also believe our delivery approach will provide an improvement in the beneficial effects of estradiol when compared to the currently approved combination HRT therapies; these include orally administered formulations utilizing synthetic progestogens, which have been associated in published clinical trials with higher risk of side effects including cardiovascular events. In addition, we believe that delivery using our IVR technology will improve patient compliance and convenience versus other routes of administration, including oral therapies and patches. We completed our preclinical animal studies and expect to finalize the results of these studies for our IVR programs, which consist of JNP-0101, JNP-0201 and JNP-0301 (the “IVR program”) in the first half of 2018. Pending the final results of these studies, we may seek a partner for our JNP-0201 product candidate, on a stand-alone basis or in combination with one or more of our other IVR program candidates.

• | JNP-0301 is a natural progesterone IVR product candidate for the prevention of preterm birth (“PTB”) in women with a short cervical length. Short cervical length at mid-pregnancy is a critical predictor of preterm birth in women. Medical guidelines issued by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine, among others, support use of vaginal progesterone in women with a short cervical length at mid-pregnancy to reduce the risk of PTB. There is no FDA approved therapy to prevent PTB in women at risk due to short cervix. We believe JNP-0301 can enable the consistent local delivery of progesterone while facilitating patient compliance. We completed our preclinical animal studies and expect to finalize the results of these studies for our IVR programs, which consist of JNP-0101, JNP-0201 and JNP-0301 (the “IVR program”) in the first half of 2018. Pending the final results of these studies, we plan to seek a partner for our JNP-0301 product candidate, on a stand-alone basis or in combination with one or more of our other IVR program candidates.

 In August 2016, we announced that the Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating COL-1077 (10% lidocaine bioadhesive vaginal gel) for the reduction of pain intensity in women undergoing an endometrial biopsy with tenaculum placement did not achieve its primary and secondary endpoints. The safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of COL-1077 were consistent with what has been observed in prior clinical trials of the lidocaine bioadhesive vaginal gel. Based on the outcome of this study we discontinued further development of COL-1077 and reallocated resources to our preclinical programs.

OUR STRATEGY
 Our strategy is to grow Crinone in key markets and expand both the JPS technical and geographic reach. Key elements of our strategy include:
  
• | Supplying Crinone to our commercial partner, Merck KGaA, for sale in over 90 countries around the world;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growing revenue from our formulation, analytical and product development capabilities at JPS, and potentially deploying those same capabilities for the advancement of our in-house product candidates; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Finalizing the results of our in vivo preclinical animal studies for our IVR program in the first half of 2018 with the goal of seeking one or more partners for our IVR product candidates or IVR platform.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OUR PROPRIETARY DRUG DELIVERY TECHNOLOGIES
 We have two key proprietary drug delivery technologies:
 Bioadhesive Delivery System
 Our BDS is a unique drug delivery technology that facilitates binding to mucosal surfaces (buccal and vaginal areas) upon administration, and allows release of the active drug in a controlled and sustained manner until the BDS gel is discharged upon normal cell turnover. This occurs every three to five days for the vaginal epithelium, and up to every 24 hours for the oral mucosa. Our BDS is utilized in Crinone.
 The key BDS ingredient is polycarbophil, which is a non-immunogenic, hypo-allergenic, bioadhesive polymer. Polycarbophil bonds to the cells of the body’s mucosal surfaces upon administration. This happens because polycarbophil mimics negatively charged mucin, the glycoprotein component of mucus that is responsible for its attachment to underlying epithelial surfaces.
 Intravaginal Ring Technology
 In March 2015, we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to the intellectual property rights for a novel segmented IVR technology. This IVR technology has the potential to deliver one or more drugs, including hormones and larger molecules such as peptides, at different dosages and release rates within a single segmented ring. Drugs such as progesterone and leuprolide have already been tested using the technology and demonstrated sustained release for up to three weeks.
 We believe our proprietary multi-segment IVR may have advantages over currently available intravaginal rings for the reasons described below.
 Homogenized, Membrane-Free-Design
 Currently marketed intravaginal rings utilize a polymer membrane to control the delivery of a single drug to the patient from the ring. The two membrane ring types in use are reservoir-type and sandwich type. Reservoir rings utilize a drug-loaded core that is encapsulated by a polymer membrane. Sandwich-type rings utilize a drug-loaded layer between a core, typically silicone, and a polymer membrane. The inherent risk associated with membrane rings is “drug dumping” which occurs if the membrane ruptures or tears.
 By contrast, our IVR has a solid homogenous cross-section with drug and specific excipients distributed within an ethylene vinyl acetate (“EVA”) polymer. The ring is manufactured using hot melt extrusion with no drug reservoirs or layers and active drug is released to the patient by diffusions through the polymer.
 Molecular Weight Not Limited to Small Molecules
 Reservoir and sandwich type rings are limited in the size of molecules, typically small molecules, they are able to deliver due to the use of a polymer membrane. By contrast, to date, no molecular weight limit has been 
 6

identified for our IVR, and preclinical and clinical studies, including a study by Kimball et al, published in the Journal of Controlled Release in May 2016, have demonstrated its ability to deliver larger sized peptides and lipophilic hormones1.
 This publication describes a Phase 1 clinical trial in which our IVR was used to administer leuprolide, a nine amino acid peptide. Serum leuprolide levels rose within eight hours to levels typically seen following parenteral injections. This was the first demonstration of trans-epithelial delivery of leuprolide across the vaginal mucosa, and provided proof-of-concept demonstrating that we could achieve therapeutic levels with our IVRs.
 Segmentation Capability
 To date, membrane rings have been limited to delivering a single drug at a single dosage range. Our IVR technology allows a ring to be designed to deliver one or more drugs in a single ring using specific drug segments, with each segment designed based on its own dose delivery criteria. Each segment is specifically designed and produced and the segmented ring is assembled using proprietary know-how, thus allowing generation of new intellectual property as each new combined drug-device is created.
 We believe our IVR technology may provide the basis for developing products we could bring to market ourselves as well as products in which we expect there would be significant partnering interest.
 In September 2017, we announced a strategic reprioritization to allow us to focus our resources on our core business of Crinone and JPS. In addition, as part of our more focused research and development strategy, we completed our in vivo preclinical animal studies for our IVR program, and based on the final results of these studies in the first half of 2018, we plan to seek the support of one or more partners for our IVR product candidates.
 COMMERCIAL PRODUCT
 CRINONE
 Crinone is a progesterone gel designed for progesterone supplementation or replacement as part of ART for infertile women with progesterone deficiency. Crinone is approved for marketing in the United States, Europe, Asia, Japan and certain other markets, and the primary source of our commercial revenue. We have licensed Crinone to our commercial partner, Merck KGaA, for the markets outside the United States and we receive product revenues from the manufacture and sale of Crinone internationally. In 2010, we sold the U.S. intellectual property rights of Crinone to Allergan, and received royalty revenues from Allergan based on their U.S. sales through October 2016.  In November 2016, we entered into an agreement with Allergan to monetize future royalty payments due to us. Under the agreement, we received a one-time non-refundable payment of $11.0 million in exchange for which Allergan will no longer be required to make future royalty payments to us.
 Crinone continues to be introduced in new countries by Merck KGaA. In April 2013, our license and supply agreement with Merck KGaA for the sale of Crinone outside the United States was renewed for an additional five-year term, extending the expiration date to May 19, 2020. Under the terms of our current license and supply agreement with Merck KGaA, we sell Crinone to Merck KGaA on a country-by-country basis at the greater of (i) direct manufacturing cost plus 20% or (ii) a percentage of Merck KGaA’s net selling price based on a tiered structure. Additionally, we are jointly cooperating with Merck KGaA to evaluate and implement clinical manufacturing cost reductions, with both parties sharing any benefits realized from these initiatives. In January 2018, we announced the extension of this supply agreement for an additional 4.5-years through at least December 31, 2024. This extension allows for a volume tiered, fixed price per unit with minimum annual volume guarantees, beginning on July 1, 2020.
 If, at the end of the supply term, the parties cannot agree upon mutually acceptable terms for renewal of the supply arrangement, Merck KGaA will have the option to negotiate the purchase of all of the Company’s assets related to the Crinone supply chain and to transfer the manufacturing to a third party or take over the management of the supply of the product. See “– Collaboration Agreements – Merck KGaA.”

PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICE BUSINESS
 JPS, our pharmaceutical service business, offers a range of sophisticated technical services to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. Our customers range from start-up biotechnology firms to global pharmaceutical companies.
 Within our services offering, we provide expertise to our customers on the characterization, development, and manufacturing of pharmaceutical compounds for clinical trials. We believe we have particular expertise in problem solving for challenging compounds that are considered “difficult to progress.” Our service model allows us to take our customers’ product candidates from early development through clinical trial manufacturing. We also support our customers with advanced analytical and consulting services for intellectual property issues. We deploy these same capabilities for our in-house proprietary product development activities.
 Through JPS, we also manage the global supply chain and contract manufacturing of Crinone, for our partner, Merck KGaA.
 OUR PRECLINICAL PROGRAMS
 In September 2017, we announced a strategic reprioritization to allow us to focus our resources on the core businesses of Crinone progesterone gel and JPS and, as part of our more focused research and development strategy, we completed our in vivo preclinical animal studies for our IVR program and based on the final results of these studies, we plan to seek the support of one or more partners for our IVR product candidates.
 JNP-0101
 Overactive Bladder
 OAB is a widespread, chronic condition caused by involuntary contraction of the detrusor muscles before the bladder is full. OAB affects approximately 20 million women in the United States, with an estimated nine million receiving pharmacotherapy to treat the condition. In 2015, the U.S. OAB market was estimated to be $2.3 billion.
 The most common prescription drug is generic oral oxybutynin. Oxybutynin addresses OAB by decreasing muscle spasms of the bladder and the frequent urge to urinate caused by these spasms. Unfortunately, more than 70% of women discontinue oxybutynin within the first year due to adverse events (45-55%) or perceived inadequate efficacy (~25%). According to Technavio Insights, 7 to 9 million women are eligible for OAB treatment and approximately 6.8 million patients failed oral oxybutynin. Current branded therapies range from $3,000-4,000 per year. We believe that a new therapy that demonstrates improved side effect profile could support pricing above the current generic products.
 Our Solution – JNP-0101
 JNP-0101, our novel oxybutynin IVR, has the potential to address the most pressing unserved clinical needs in the treatment of OAB. By delivering oxybutynin intravaginally, JNP-0101 leverages the region’s shared vascular and lymphatic networks to achieve localized absorption of oxybutynin by relevant tissues, while bypassing hepatic first pass metabolism. We anticipate an improvement in the side effect profile of oxybutynin using this delivery route, in addition to improved compliance afforded by a once monthly ring insertion. We believe JNP-0101 has the potential to increase convenience in many patients and improve disease management and overall outcomes.
Supporting Data
 Initial proof-of-concept for JNP-0101 was provided by multiple peer reviewed publications on the safety and efficacy of a once-monthly oxybutynin vaginal ring. The ring evaluated in these studies was a reservoir-type ring constructed of molded silicone with a cylindrical cavity into which the oxybutynin or placebo material was loaded. By contrast, JNP-0101 is constructed of ethylene vinyl acetate with the oxybutynin homogenized throughout.
 8

In these studies, delivery of oxybutynin was found to offer women a once-monthly treatment option for OAB. However, the molded silicone oxybutynin IVR evaluated was not brought to market by the sponsor due to factors that included its decision to exit women’s health.
 JNP-0201
 JNP-0201 is a segmented IVR containing both natural progesterone and estradiol for HRT in menopausal women. This delivery approach is expected to provide an improved side effect profile as natural hormones will be delivered locally to vaginal tissue where they are needed. In addition, delivery using our IVR technology is expected to improve patient compliance and convenience versus other routes of administration, including oral and transdermal approaches. 
 Hormone Replacement Therapy
 In the United States, there is a large and growing market for HRT. In 2015, the U.S. HRT market was estimated at over $4 billion, comprising both pharmacy-compounded and FDA-approved therapies, of which prescription for oral hormone therapy accounted for $2 billion in U.S. sales on 21 million prescriptions. 
 While there are nearly 40 FDA-approved HRT products on the market, the HRT combination therapies fall short. Currently, HRT combination therapies only occupy approximately 30% of the U.S. HRT market. All FDA-approved HRT combination products contain synthetic progestin rather than natural progesterone; recent studies suggest natural progestogens are associated with fewer cardiovascular adverse events. In addition, all current combination HRT products are orally administered, which cause extensive first pass metabolism and require daily dosing.
 In 2012, the North American Menopause Society (“NAMS”) issued a Consensus Statement which supports HRT in peri- and post-menopausal women. This statement endorsed use of HRT in women within 10 years of menopause, concluded that hormone treatment should be individualized based on each patient’s personal risk factors, and identified a growing body of evidence that HRT formulation, route of administration, and the timing of therapy produce different biologic effects. In 2017, the NAMS updated their 2012 statement and reaffirmed and strengthened their position statement that estradiol- based HRT continues to be the most effective therapy to reduce symptoms of menopause and to prevent bone loss and fracture. 
 These position statements are endorsed by many important health organizations, including the Academy of Women’s Health, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, and the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals. This underscores the need for new and innovative treatment options such as an IVR administration, and reaffirms our commitment to furthering our IVR platform.
 We expect that as a result of the 2017 NAMS Statement, the percentage of the approximately 45 million American women who are menopausal or approaching menopause who receive HRT will increase.
 Our Solution – JNP-0201
 We believe that JNP-0201, our combination estrogen and progesterone IVR product candidate, has the potential to offer patients multiple benefits as compared with currently available therapies, including: integrated administration of natural progesterone and natural estrogen; improved patient compliance; improved side effect profile; and continuous local vaginal delivery of natural hormones, while eliminating the need for daily administration. 
 JNP-0301
 JNP-0301 is a natural progesterone IVR for the prevention of PTB in women with a short cervical length at mid-pregnancy. Short cervical length at mid-pregnancy is a critical predictor of PTB in women, and medical guidelines support use of vaginal progesterone for treatment of this condition. There is no FDA-approved 
 9

therapy to prevent PTB in women at-risk due to short cervix. We believe JNP-0301 has the potential to enable the consistent local delivery of progesterone improving patient compliance.
 Preterm Birth due to Short Cervical Length
 PTB, defined as delivery before 37 weeks gestation, is a significant public health issue. Globally, 15 million babies are born prematurely each year, and approximately one million die due to PTB complications.  In the United States, approximately 10% of live-births are delivered prematurely. In a typical pregnancy, the average cervical length at 24 weeks gestation is 35mm; short cervical length is generally considered 10 mm – 30 mm.  A review of 39,000 cases of PTB found that short cervical length at mid-pregnancy was the most important single predictor of PTB2. Over 30% of cases of PTB have short cervical length at mid-pregnancy. Approximately 400,000 women in the United States are estimated to be at risk for PTB due to short cervical length.  The incidence of this condition is expected to rise as more physicians adopt the current medical guidelines to screen for short cervical length in all pregnant women.
 Clinical data strongly support the use of vaginal progesterone for prevention of PTB. Furthermore, there is clear consensus that vaginal progesterone should be used for prevention of PTB in women with short cervical length at mid-pregnancy, including Medical Practice Guidelines from the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, an American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (“ACOG”) Committee Opinion, and an Issue Brief from Medicaid Health Plans of America. Despite the medical need and cost savings associated with prevention of PTB, there are currently no products that are FDA approved to prolong gestation in this patient population.
 Our Solution – JNP-0301
 JNP-0301, our progesterone IVR, may offer meaningful benefits to pregnant women with short cervical length. By providing continuous, consistent, local delivery of natural progesterone, this product candidate may increase patient compliance as compared to current off-label progestogens, which require daily administration, thereby potentially improving overall outcomes. 
MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION
 Our business strategy includes pursuing collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including our IVR program. Even if we were to internally develop our product candidates, we plan to use a third-party contract manufacturer for the clinical supply and commercial manufacture of these product candidates.
 Our ability to conduct later-stage clinical trials, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates may depend on the ability of third-party manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates on a large scale at a competitive cost and in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), and foreign regulatory requirements, if applicable.
 Use of third-party manufacturers limits our control over and ability to monitor the manufacturing process. As a result, we may not be able to detect a variety of problems that may arise in the manufacturing process, and we may incur additional costs in the process of interfacing with and monitoring the progress of our contract manufacturers. If third-party manufacturers fail to meet our manufacturing needs in an acceptable manner, we would face delays and additional costs while we develop internal manufacturing capabilities or find alternate third-party manufacturers. It may not be possible to have multiple third-party manufacturers ready to supply us with needed material at all or without incurring significant costs.
 SOURCES OF SUPPLY
 The major raw materials we use in our products and product candidates are polycarbophil, progesterone and ethylene vinyl acetate (“EVA”).

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 10

Medical grade, cross-linked polycarbophil, the polymer used in our BDS-based product, Crinone, is currently available from only one supplier, Lubrizol, Inc. (“Lubrizol”). We believe that Lubrizol will supply as much of the material as we require because our product ranks among the highest value-added uses of the polymer. In the event that Lubrizol cannot or will not supply enough polycarbophil to satisfy our needs, however, we will be required to seek alternative sources of supply.
 Currently we only have one supplier of progesterone for Crinone approved by regulatory authorities in all the countries in which we sell Crinone outside the United States. To date, we have not experienced production delays due to shortages of progesterone. Beginning in 2017, this supplier increased the price for its progesterone. We have identified a second supplier of progesterone. The second supplier has been approved in several countries and is in the regulatory approval process in numerous other countries. We expect to receive regulatory approval for our second supplier in the countries where we sell Crinone within the next two years.
 Our IVR technology utilizes medical grade EVA polymer for which there are a limited number of vendors.  We are not aware of any companies, other than our existing supplier, which manufacture EVA meeting the specifications required for use in our pharmaceutical IVR application.  We have purchased cGMP pharmaceutical grade EVA from a single supplier for development applications but have not entered into a commercial supply agreement.  Even if an acceptable commercial supply agreement can be negotiated with our existing supplier, it may not be possible to identify a back-up, or second source of EVA, should they be unable to supply material, for any reason. 
 As discussed in greater detail in Item 1A of this Annual Report, the loss of any of our current third-party suppliers of raw materials for our product and product candidates could impair our ability to manufacture and sell our products.
 COMPETITION
 We and our commercial partners compete against established pharmaceutical companies who market products and services addressing the same markets and patient needs. Further, numerous companies are developing, or may develop, enhanced delivery systems, products and services that compete with our present and proposed products and services. It is possible that we may not have the resources to withstand these and other competitive forces. Some of these competitors possess greater financial, research and technical resources than us or our partners. Moreover, these companies may possess greater marketing capabilities than we or our partners possess, including the resources to implement extensive advertising campaigns.
 The pharmaceutical industry is subject to change as new delivery technologies are developed, new products enter the market, regulatory requirements change, generic versions of available drugs become available and treatment paradigms evolve to reflect these and other medical research discoveries. We face significant competition in all areas of our business. The rapid pace of change in the pharmaceutical industry continually creates new opportunities for competitors and start-ups and can quickly render existing products, technologies and services less valuable. Customer requirements and physician and patient preferences continually change as new treatment options emerge, are more or less heavily promoted, and become less expensive. As a result, we and our partners may not gain, and may lose, market share.
 According to published reports, menopause, post-menopause, osteoporosis, breast cancer, and polycystic ovary syndrome (“PCOS”) are the most common issues affecting women’s health in the U.S. The US market for women’s health is expected to grow from nearly $19.5 billion in 2015 to over $25.3 billion by 2020. The women’s health therapeutics market is one of the most attractive markets in the global pharmaceutical industry. Hormone therapy, gynecological disorders and musculoskeletal disorders in women are the prime area of focus in the women’s health therapeutics market. 
 CRINONE
 Crinone, a natural progesterone product, competes in markets with other progestins, both synthetic and natural, that may be delivered by pharmacy-compounded injections or vaginal suppositories, including Prometrium®
11

(oral micronized progesterone) marketed by Abbott Laboratories, and Endometrin® (progesterone vaginal insert) marketed by Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 Juniper Pharma Services
 There is a range of large and smaller scale competitors who compete with JPS, providing similar pharmaceutical development and consulting services. Some of these competitors have greater financial and human resources than we do and have established reputations, as well as worldwide distribution channels and sales and marketing capabilities, that are larger and more established than ours.
 Additional competitors may also enter the market, and we are likely to compete with new companies in the future.
 Competition among organizations providing pharmaceutical development and analytical services is characterized by technical expertise and reputation, breadth of technical services, budget considerations, and the ability to timely meet the customer’s requirements. Accordingly, our success depends in part on establishing, maintaining and expanding our client base, offering new innovative services and maintaining regulatory and quality compliance.
 Potential customers also may decide not to purchase our services, or to delay such purchases, due to technical, clinical, regulatory or financial considerations beyond our control. In addition, we expect that competitive pressures may result in price competition, which could affect our profitability.
 JNP-0101
 JNP-0101 is our IVR designed to deliver oxybutynin to treat OAB in women.
 Oxybutynin is currently approved for the treatment of OAB in oral and transdermal gel formulations. Oral oxybutynin chloride tablets are the most widely prescribed formulation of this antimuscarinic agent, the first of which was approved in 2006. Gelnique ® (oxybutynin chloride 10% topical gel), marketed by Allergan, was approved by the FDA in 2009.
 Additional antimuscarinics approved for the treatment of OAB include VESIcare® (solifenacin) marketed by Astellas Pharma Inc. (“Astellas”) and Detrol LA ® (tolterodine), Toviaz ® (fesoterodine), and Enablex ® (darifenacin), all marketed by Pfizer. Additionally, the beta agonist Mybetriq ® (mirabegron) was approved by the FDA in 2012 and is marketed by Astellas. Other treatments include Allergan’s Botox® (botulinum toxin type A) which was approved for OAB in 2013.
 There are currently ongoing clinical trials for several prospective OAB therapeutics, including Premarin® vaginal cream and the Axonics Sacral Neuromodulation System, which received marketing approval in Canada and the CE Mark.  Additionally, there is a combination of already approved oral therapies being developed by Astellas.
 JNP-0201
 JNP-0201 is our combination estrogen and progesterone IVR candidate designed to be used for HRT in menopausal women.

Since 2013, there has been increased oversight by the FDA on all non-FDA approved combination therapies, supplied by compounding pharmacies and commonly referred to as “bioidentical” drugs. These non-approved drugs are difficult to measure and monitor by the FDA, leading to concerns over safe use. JNP-0201, if approved, will offer an alternative combination therapy. The largest competitors in the FDA-approved market are Pfizer with Premarin (conjugated estrogens) and Prempro (conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets) Mylan, with Barr (generic estradiol) and Noven (minivelle), with sales of Prempro leading combination therapeutics used for HRT in menopausal women. It was approved by the FDA in 1995 for use in women with an intact uterus for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and/or vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause, and for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
 None of the current FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause are bioidentical to the estradiol and progesterone the ovaries produce. U.S. sales of non-FDA approved compounded hormone therapy products are very fragmented as these drugs are typically prepared and sold by individual compounding pharmacies. Despite this, the US sales of non-FDA approved compounded combination estradiol and progesterone products is estimated to be over $1.5 billion per year based on various reports.
 If approved, JNP-0201 would compete directly with other combination products of estradiol and progesterone that are bioidentical to the natural estradiol and progesterone produced in the ovaries. An oral combination estradiol and progesterone drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (“VMS”) due to menopause, TX-001HR by TherapeuticsMD, has completed Phase 3 clinical trials and proven statistical significance in the reduction of vasomotor symptoms of menopause.  TherapeuticsMD is also working on additional products for post-menopausal indications in various forms of delivery.  WC-3011 by Allergan, a vaginal cream estradiol acetate formulation, has completed multiple Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of VVA and dyspareunia and has achieved efficacy endpoints.
 JNP-0301
 JNP-0301 is our natural progesterone IVR designed to prevent PTB in women with short cervical length (“SCL”) at mid-pregnancy.
 To date, there is currently no FDA-approved product to prevent PTB in women at-risk due to SCL. There are currently ongoing clinical trials evaluating use of pessary to PTB birth in women with SCL; cerclage to prevent PTB in women with SCL and a history of a prior preterm birth or mid-trimester miscarriage.  One Phase 3 study by the University of Kansas Medical Center that is currently recruiting participants is attempting to determine if giving a larger amount of Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) than currently included in some prenatal supplements can reduce early preterm birth. Another ongoing and recruiting Phase 4 study by Federico II University is investigating cervical cerclage for preventing spontaneous preterm birth in singleton pregnancies without prior spontaneous preterm birth and with short transvaginal ultrasound cervical length. Another study completed several years ago by Maternal-Infantil Vall d´Hebron Hospital investigated the use of the Aravin pessary, a silicon ring, for the reduction of spontaneous preterm birth in women with short cervical length at 18-22 weeks scan.
 COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS
 Our primary revenue product is Crinone. We have licensed Crinone to Merck KGaA, outside the United States, and sold the rights to Crinone to Allergan, in the United States.
 Merck KGaA
 In April 2013, our license and supply agreement with Merck KGaA for the sale of Crinone outside the United States was renewed for an additional five-year term, extending the expiration date to May 19, 2020. We are the exclusive supplier of Crinone to Merck KGaA. Merck KGaA holds marketing authorizations for Crinone in over 90 countries outside the United States. In January 2018, we announced the extension of this supply agreement for an additional 4.5-years through at least December 31, 2024.
 13

Under the terms of our current license and supply agreement with Merck KGaA, we will sell Crinone to Merck KGaA on a country-by-country basis at the greater of (i) direct manufacturing cost plus 20% or (ii) a percentage of Merck KGaA’s net selling price on a tiered structure. Additionally, we are jointly cooperating with Merck KGaA to evaluate and implement manufacturing cost reduction measures, with both parties sharing any benefits realized from these initiatives. This agreement requires Merck KGaA to provide a rolling 18-month forecast of its Crinone requirements for each country in which the product is marketed. The first four months of each forecast are considered firm orders. Under the agreement, each party is responsible for new clinical trials and government registrations in its territory and the parties are obligated to consult from time to time regarding the studies. Each party has agreed to promptly provide the other party the data from its Crinone studies free-of-charge. During the term of the agreement, we have agreed not to develop, license, manufacture or sell to another party outside the United States any product for the vaginal delivery of progesterone or progestational agents for hormone replacement therapy or other indications where progesterone or progestational agents are commonly used.
 The extension of the supply agreement allows for a volume tiered, fixed price per unit with minimum annual volume guarantees, beginning on July 1, 2020. If, at the end of the supply term, the parties cannot agree upon mutually acceptable terms for renewal of the supply arrangement, Merck KGaA will have the option to negotiate the purchase of all of the Company’s assets related to the Crinone supply chain and to transfer the manufacturing to a third party or take over the management of the supply of the product. 
 Allergan
 Within the United States, Crinone was marketed by Allergan (which changed its name from Actavis, Inc. in 2015 and from Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2012, each as a result of an acquisition) pursuant to a Purchase and Collaboration Agreement dated March 2010. In November 2016, we entered into an agreement with Allergan to monetize future royalty payments due to us.  Under the agreement, we received a one-time non-refundable payment of $11.0 million in exchange for which Allergan will no longer be required to pay future royalty payments to us.  This amount was recognized as revenue in the year ended December 31, 2016.
Massachusetts General Hospital
 On March 27, 2015 we entered into an Exclusive Patent License Agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital, (“MGH”) pursuant to which we licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to MGH’s patent rights in a novel IVR technology for the delivery of one or more pharmaceuticals at different dosages and release rates in a single segmented ring.
 Unless earlier terminated by the parties, the license agreement will remain in effect until the later of (i) the date on which all issued patents and filed patent applications within the licensed patent rights have expired or been abandoned and (ii) one year after the last sale for which a royalty is due under the license agreement or 10 years after such expiration or abandonment date referred to in (i), whichever is earlier. We have the right to terminate the license agreement by giving 90 days advance written notice to MGH. MGH has the right to terminate the license agreement based on our failure to make payments due under the license agreement, subject to a 15-day cure period, or our failure to maintain the insurance required by the license agreement. MGH may also terminate the license agreement based on our non-financial default under the license agreement, subject to a 60-day cure period.
 Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we have agreed to reimburse MGH for all costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights and have agreed to pay MGH a $50,000 annual license fee on each of the first five year anniversaries of the effective date of the license agreement, and a $100,000 annual license fee beginning on the sixth anniversary of the effective date of the license agreement and on each subsequent anniversary thereafter. The annual license fee is creditable against any royalties or sublicense income payable in each calendar year.
 Under the terms of the license agreement, we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product and/or process related to the IVR technology, which efforts will include the making of certain minimum annual expenditures in each of the first five years following the effective date of the license agreement. We have also agreed to pay MGH certain milestone payments totaling up to $1.2 million tied to our achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones, and certain annual royalty payments based on net sales of any such patented products or processes developed by us.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including pursuing and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their manufacture and methods of use, and other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including certain aspects of our formulation and device development expertise and know-how.
 Our commercial success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technologies, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others.
 The patent positions for pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific, and factual issues. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
 With regard to our Crinone product, all of our patents covering the product have expired in all countries other than Argentina.
 With regard to our JNP-0101, JNP-0201, and JNP-0301 product candidates, we have exclusively in-licensed from MGH (as discussed above) four issued U.S. patents with composition of matter, method of manufacture and method of use claims directed to the JNP-0101, JNP-0201, and JPN-0301 product candidates and their manufacture and use. These U.S. patents are scheduled to expire from 2024 to 2027. In addition, we have in-licensed counterpart patents that have been granted in Australia, Canada, Europe, and Japan, which are expected to expire in 2024. Allergan holds a United States method of use patent that would apply to JNP-0301 and expires in 2028.
 The term of any individual patent depends upon laws of the countries in which such patent is obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application.
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secret protection for our proprietary information that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including, for example, certain aspects of our formulation and device development expertise and know-how. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Although we take reasonable steps to protect our proprietary information, including restricting access to our premises and to our confidential information, as well as entering into agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and potential collaborators, third parties may independently develop the same or similar subject matter and know-how or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.
 GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
 15

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and subsequently maintaining compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or following approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, voluntary product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical study related regulations, referred to as good clinical practices (“GCPs”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Nonclinical Studies and IND Submission
 The testing and approval process of product candidates requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources. Nonclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of drug substance chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, and drug product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Such studies must generally be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s GLP regulations. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, an IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests and nonclinical literature, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and proposed clinical study protocols, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. In the case of 505(b)(2) applications, though, some of the IND components may not be required. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted.
 16

An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, notifies the applicant of safety concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose a clinical hold at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or noncompliance. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA with the submission of an NDA. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, the efficacy criteria to be evaluated, and a statistical analysis plan. A protocol for each clinical trial, and any subsequent protocol amendments, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an institutional review board (“IRB”), at each study site participating in the clinical trial or a central IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, informed consent forms, and communications to study subjects before a study commences at that site. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits and whether the planned human subject protections are adequate. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA for review, and to the IRB for approval. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must also be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, findings from other studies, and animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), for public dissemination on their clinicaltrials.gov website.
 Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects, enrollment of potential trial subjects, and the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. The data safety monitoring board receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may advise the sponsor to halt the clinical trial if it determined there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or on other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
 The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA.
 In general, for purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1 – Studies are initially conducted in healthy human volunteers or subjects with the target disease or condition and test the investigational drug for safety, dosage tolerance, structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion. If possible, Phase 1 clinical trials may also be used to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17

 
• | Phase 2 – Controlled studies are conducted in limited subject populations with a specified disease or condition to evaluate preliminary efficacy, identify optimal dosages, dosage tolerance and schedule, possible adverse effects and safety risks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 – These adequate and well-controlled clinical trials are undertaken in expanded subject populations, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to generate enough data to provide evidence of clinical efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Typically, two Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA may also require, or companies may conduct, additional clinical trials for the same indication after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 clinical trials may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information.
 In the case of a 505(b)(2) NDA, which is a marketing application in which sponsors may rely on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted, some of the above-described clinical trials and nonclinical studies may not be required or may be abbreviated. Bridging studies may be needed, however, to demonstrate the applicability of the studies that were previously conducted by other sponsors to the drug that is the subject of the marketing application.
 Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Regulatory authorities or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, or the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA’s requirements. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 NDA Submission and Review by the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical and nonclinical testing, the results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results, and information about the manufacturing process and facilities, are all submitted to the FDA, along with the proposed labeling, as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. The user fee must be paid at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances including where the applicant employs fewer than 500 employees (including employees of affiliates) where the applicant does not have a drug product that has been approved and introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce and where the applicant (including its affiliates) is submitting its first marketing application. Product candidates that are designated as orphan drugs, which are further described below, are also not subject to application user fees unless the application includes an indication other than the orphan indication.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), as amended, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen, or route of administration must 
 18

contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. An assessment of the REMS must also be conducted at set intervals. Following product approval, a REMS may also be required by the FDA if new safety information is discovered and the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug.
 Once the FDA receives an application, it has 60 days to review the NDA to determine if it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review, before it accepts the application for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA.
 Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA has set the goal of completing its review of 90% of all applications within 10 months from the 60-day filing date for its initial review of a standard NDA for a New Molecular Entity (“NME”). For non-NME standard applications, the FDA has set the goal of completing its review of 90% of all applications within 10 months from the submission date. Such deadlines are referred to as the PDUFA date. The PDUFA date is only a goal, thus, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates. The review process and the PDUFA date may also be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides substantial additional information or clarification regarding the submission.
 The FDA must refer applications for drugs that contain active ingredients, including any ester or salt of the active ingredients, that have not previously been approved by the FDA to an advisory committee or provide in an action letter a summary of its reasons for not referring the application to an advisory committee. The FDA may also refer drugs to advisory committees when it is determined that an advisory committee’s expertise would be beneficial to the regulatory decision-making process, including the evaluation of novel products and the use of new technology. An advisory committee is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, which review, evaluate, and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing methods and controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, safety, potency, and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a Pre-Approval Inspection. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities, including contract manufacturers and subcontractors, are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA the FDA will inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
 The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than an applicant interprets the same data.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). If a CRL is issued, the 
 19

applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval and describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the NDA. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA, and may require additional clinical or nonclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. The FDA has the goal of reviewing 90% of application resubmissions in either two or six months of the resubmission date, depending on the kind of resubmission. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may also not approve label statements that are necessary for successful commercialization and marketing.
 The FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with the pre- and post-marketing regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling, or FDA notification may be required.
 505(b)(2) Approval Process
 Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA provides an alternate regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and permits the filing of an NDA where at least one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved product or on published scientific literature, in support of its application. The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional trials to support the changes from the previously approved drug and to further demonstrate the new drug’s safety and effectiveness. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Orange Book Listing
 Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application in which the applicant, in part, relies on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics, and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. Limited changes must be pre-approved by the FDA via a suitability petition. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include nonclinical and clinical data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of 
 20

active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product and method of use. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also known as the Orange Book. These products may be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.
 Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make patent certifications to the FDA that: (1) no patent information on the drug or method of use that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) the patent has expired; (3) the date on which the patent has expired and approval will not be sought until after the patent expiration; or (4) the patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through a paragraph IV certification or if the applicant is not seeking approval of a patented method of use. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 If the competitor has provided a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the competitor must also send notice of the paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the reference listed drug and the patent owner within 20 days after the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a paragraph IV certification notice prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay.
 In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owners regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation.
 Exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDA provides periods of regulatory exclusivity, which provides the holder of an approved NDA limited protection from new competition in the marketplace for the innovation represented by its approved drug. Five years of exclusivity are available to New Chemical Entities (“NCEs”). An NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt, including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds, or other noncovalent derivatives, such as a complex, chelate, or clathrate, of the molecule, responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review and approve an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application, however, may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a paragraph IV certification is filed.
 If a product is not eligible for NCE exclusivity, it may be eligible for three years of exclusivity. Three-year exclusivity is available to the holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation or indication for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, was essential to the 
 21

approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity period protects against FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for the condition of the new drug’s approval. As a general matter, the three-year exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will also not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Moreover, even if a product receives a period of exclusivity, a physician may prescribe the reference listed drug or a generic version of the reference listed drug off-label for the same use as the newly approved drug.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity period described above. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. Moreover, pediatric exclusivity attaches to all formulations, dosage forms, and indications for products with existing marketing exclusivity or patent life that contain the same active moiety as that which was studied.
 Post-approval Requirements
 Any drug manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals is subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things: requirements related to manufacturing, recordkeeping, and reporting, including adverse experience reporting, drug shortage reporting, and periodic reporting; product sampling and distribution; advertising; marketing; promotion; certain electronic records and signatures; and post-approval obligations imposed as a condition of approval, such as Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS, and surveillance to assess safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are annual prescription drug product programs fees. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and list their drug products, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other requirements, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon the company and third-party manufacturers.
 Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval or notification before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and specifications, and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the manufacturer and any third-party manufacturers that the NDA holder may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 The FDA also strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, including direct to consumer advertising, and promotion of drug products that are placed on the market. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Physicians, in their independent professional medical judgment, may prescribe legally available products for unapproved indications that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Pharmaceutical companies, however, are required to promote their drug products only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including, but not limited to, criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims 
 22

Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements, debarment, and refusal of government contracts.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 Moreover, the Drug Quality and Security Act (“DQSA”), enacted in 2013, imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing, which are being implemented over a 10-year period. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers are or will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers are also required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufacturers have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in significant regulatory actions. Such actions may include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, provision of corrective information, imposition of post-market requirements including the need for additional testing, imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS, voluntary product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, FDA debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment from receiving government contracts and new orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment, and may result in adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences.
 Regulation of Combination Products in the United States
 Certain products may be comprised of components that would normally be regulated by different regulatory authorities, and frequently by different centers within the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Specifically, under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be:

• | a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 23

 
• | a drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually-specified drug, or device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the FDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. That determination is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a drug-device combination product is attributable to the drug product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.
 New Legislation and Regulations
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Pricing and Reimbursement
 Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government healthcare program administrative authorities, managed care organizations, private health insurers, and other entities. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, our products, once approved, may not obtain market acceptance unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.
 The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved or that any required patient cost-sharing amount will be acceptable to the patient. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor and among the insured lives of an individual payor depending upon the benefits applicable to the insured person. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate 
 24

reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for drug products and medical services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health develop research plans and periodically report on the status of the research and related expenditures to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for governmental or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if approved, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates, if approved.
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be priced significantly lower.
 Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws and Other Regulatory Matters
 In the United States, among other things, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products are potentially subject to regulation and enforcement by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General and the Health Resources and Services Administration), the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, state attorneys general and other state and local government agencies. Our current and future business activities, including for example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with healthcare regulatory laws, including the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal False Claims Act, as amended, the privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as amended, physician payment transparency laws, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchasing, leasing, ordering or 
 25

arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future business activities, including our sales and marketing practices and/or our future relationships with healthcare providers might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us.
 The Federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent. This statute has been interpreted to prohibit presenting claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been found liable under the Federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,781 and $21,563 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the Federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the Federal False Claims Act.
 Although the Federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the criminal False Claims Act, which prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike the civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim.
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 Additionally, HIPAA created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any 
 26

materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 Payment or reimbursement of prescription drugs by Medicaid or Medicare requires manufacturers of the drugs to submit pricing information to CMS. The Medicaid Drug Rebate statute requires manufacturers to calculate and report price points, which are used to determine Medicaid rebate payments shared between the states and the federal government and Medicaid payment rates for the drug. For drugs paid under Medicare Part B, manufacturers must also calculate and report their Average Sales Price, which is used to determine the Medicare Part B payment rate for the drug. Drugs that are approved under an NDA, including 505(b)(2) drugs, are subject to an additional inflation penalty which can substantially increase rebate payments. In addition, for NDA drugs, the Veterans Health Care Act (“VHCA”), requires manufacturers to calculate and report to the Veterans Administration (“VA”), a different price called the Non-Federal Average Manufacturing Price, which is used to determine the maximum price that can be charged to certain federal agencies, referred to as the Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”). Like the Medicaid rebate amount, the FCP includes an inflation penalty. A Department of Defense regulation requires manufacturers to provide this discount on drugs dispensed by retail pharmacies when paid by the TRICARE Program. All of these price reporting requirements create risk of submitting false information to the government, and potential False Claims Act liability.
 The VHCA also requires manufacturers of covered drugs participating in the Medicaid program to enter into Federal Supply Schedule contracts with the VA through which their covered drugs must be sold to certain federal agencies at FCP and to report pricing information. This necessitates compliance with applicable federal procure laws and regulations and subjects us to contractual remedies as well as administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions. In addition, the VHCA requires manufacturers participating in Medicaid to agree to provide different mandatory discounts to certain Public Health Service grantees and other safety net hospitals and clinics.
 The Affordable Care Act included a provision commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act, which requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and report annually certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” provided, as well as any ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Covered manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. The information reported is publicly available on a searchable website. There are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us.
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
In addition to HIPAA and HITECH, other federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Various foreign countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business.
 
27

The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements subjects us to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, voluntary recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Should we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we will develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the law and program requirements to which we will or may become subject.
 To the extent that our products are sold in a foreign country, we or our collaborators may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, clinical trial and pre- and post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 Affordable Care Act and Other Reform Initiatives
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.
 The Affordable Care Act was enacted in March 2010. The Affordable Care Act includes measures that have significantly changed, and are expected to continue to significantly change, the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:
  
• | The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services in exchange for state Medicaid coverage of most of the manufacturer’s drugs. The Affordable Care Act made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs to 23.1% of average manufacturer price (“AMP”) and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Affordable Care Act expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing. In addition, because 340B pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discounts to increase. The Affordable Care Act imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Affordable Care Act imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 28

 
• | The Affordable Care Act established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Affordable Care Act created the Independent Payment Advisory Board which has the authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Affordable Care Act established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation through 2019.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. For example, the 2017 Tax Reform Act includes a provision repealing the Affordable Care Act’s individual health insurance coverage mandate, effective January 1, 2019. On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse the insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through these marketplaces. Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Further changes to the Affordable Care Act, including its repeal and replacement, are possible. Thus, the full impact of the Affordable Care Act, any law changing or replacing elements of it, and the political uncertainty surrounding any change, repeal or replacement of it on our business remains unclear.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law.  This Act, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect our future profitability.
 OUR REPORTING SEGMENTS
 We currently operate in two segments: product and service. The product segment oversees the supply chain and manufacturing of Crinone, our sole commercialized product to our commercial partner, Merck KGaA, internationally. The product segment also includes the royalty stream we received, until October 2016 from Allergan, for Crinone sales in the United States as well as the development of new product candidates. The service segment includes pharmaceutical development, clinical trial manufacturing, and advanced analytical and consulting services provided to our customers, as well as characterizing and developing pharmaceutical product candidates for our internal programs and managing the preclinical and clinical manufacturing of our technology.  In the years

ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenue from our product segment was $32.7 million, $41.5 million and $26.6 million, respectively.  In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenue from our service segment was $17.3 million, $13.1 million and $11.7 million, respectively.
 We view the development and clinical trial manufacturing of drug product for our pharmaceutical company clients and the manufacturing of Crinone for our commercial partner to be similar activities. Accordingly, we have integrated all operational activities for the Crinone business into JPS. These activities, including management of Crinone manufacturing, quality assurance and logistics and, management of our intellectual property estate are now managed out of our Nottingham, U.K. facility.
 Segment information is consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker, who we have determined to be the chief executive officer, for purposes of evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting future periods. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our product and service segments based on revenue and gross profit. Our chief operating decision maker does not review our assets, operating expenses or non-operating income and expenses by business segment at this time.
 See Note 11 to our consolidated audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for certain financial information related to our two operating segments and for certain selected financial information by geographic area, which is incorporated by reference into Item 1 of this Annual Report.
 EMPLOYEES
 As of February 28, 2018, we had 155 employees, including three executive officers, 13 employees in supply chain management and quality, four employees in sales and marketing functions, 106 employees in technical and other production functions, three employees in research and development functions and 26 employees in other administrative functions. We also use consultants as necessary to support key functions.
 Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for employees is intense in the pharmaceutical industry. We believe we have been successful in our efforts to recruit qualified employees, but we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be as successful in the future. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
